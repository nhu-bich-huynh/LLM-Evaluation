"These bombs spread death indiscriminately and the fact that they have a low rate of immediate explosion means that they continue to kill innocent people many years after conflicts have ended."
"The recent war in Lebanon, in which Israel left the country mined with thousands of cluster bombs, should give us the impetus to ban, once and for all, the manufacture and use of all kinds of cluster bomb, as we have done with anti-personnel mines."
"Perhaps merely adding a new protocol to the existing Convention against certain conventional weapons is not enough; perhaps the time has come for a specific convention."
"This does not matter, provided the EU takes action and the human race joins forces to eradicate these heinous weapons."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union and the Council are very concerned that people in conflict zones are injured or die when the conflict itself has ended."
"This is patently clear in the case of Lebanon today, where unexploded bombs are a real problem for the civilian population."
"The Presidency is pleased that the Protocol relating to unexploded ordnance has entered into force."
"In the future we will be working to ensure that the harm caused to the civilian population by munitions remains minimal."
"As for international cooperation on cluster bombs from here on, we will continue our efforts to find a common position in the European Union and make headway on this."
"Finally, I wish to say that Mrs Beer and her colleagues will be receiving an answer to their letter to the Presidency in the very near future."
"Vice-president of the Commission."
"Mr President, the informed debate that has taken place on these issues is one more strand in the argument against war and another argument for prevention and hopefully being able to avoid the use of these weapons."
"As you know, under the common foreign and security policy, these are not areas in which the Commission takes the lead."
"However, we are part of the solution when dealing with the aftermath of war."
"The human suffering, unexploded munitions and humanitarian problems which result from wars around the world are a challenge for us."
"The Commission will of course continue to support the clearance of such weapons, working with the international community and NGOs."
"The war in Lebanon lasted a few days, but the human suffering will continue for many years."
"In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."
"European initiative in the field of civil protection (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on the European initiative in the field of civil protection by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, by Mr Galeote, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development and by Mr Daul, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (B6-0442/2006)."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the European Commission, the experience acquired over recent years from dealing with natural and man-made disasters has revealed that there are shortcomings in the capacity for national intervention and, consequently, increased expectations of Community assistance, assistance which will need to have the attributes of effective intervention in the field of prevention and rapid response."
"From this point of view, an early warning and response system is needed, based on the following four components: identification and assessment of the risks, constant monitoring of the risks, a warning and communication mechanism and, lastly, preparedness, in other words the ability to respond and help."
"Allow me to refer briefly to certain parameters of particular importance which characterise such an effective civil protection mechanism, as referred to in the exceptional Barnier report passed by plenary and in the report which I presented to the Euro-Mediterranean plenary."
"We need a lookout system, intervention units from the participating states, response guidelines and the relevant information for citizens, best practices for dealing with situations and mutual consular assistance in determining contact points between Member States."
"It goes without saying that, without the necessary funding and the fundamental participation of the Member States, the entire endeavour will remain in abeyance."
"The question, therefore, Madam President-in-Office, is whether the Council has the will to respond to the demand and, of course, to secure the necessary cooperation of the Member States."
"I believe that, in the relevant decisions, the need to respond to the demand and expectations of the citizens will ultimately prevail, dictated first and foremost by the increase in and frequency and intensity of natural disasters which result in loss of life as well as financial and environmental damage."
"In addition, we must always bear in mind that promoting cooperation between the Member States in the field of civil protection will gradually consolidate a European conscience in the citizens and will be a visible example of the solidarity which must distinguish the European Union."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, without going into the underlying causes, over recent years several countries have been suffering serious natural disasters."
"Particularly in the summer, we have suffered fires, floods and the effects of a particularly severe drought."
"We frequently see how the affected regions of the Member States, sometimes of the most developed ones, lack sufficient resources to deal with these phenomena themselves."
"Nevertheless, it sometimes seems that we are more conscientious about offering our solidarity when the damage is done thousands of kilometres away than we are when it is done in a Member State."
"Despite all of this, the Council appears to be sticking to a passive approach."
"Some people will say that no more money should be spent, but it is not a financial issue, and one example of this is that you, representatives of the Council, are not making any progress on the reform of the European Solidarity Fund, which will not cost a single additional euro from the Community budget."
"Sometimes we are in no position to criticise."
"Plenary approved the sending of a delegation to the most affected regions at the beginning of September, and, Mr President, Parliament's Bureau is still tied up with regulatory issues that it has to sort out before it can give the green light to that delegation."
"We shall not lose heart, however, because nobody believes that we should not provide resources for a common effort that will make us more effective when it comes to helping people."
"The principle of subsidiarity will be respected as well."
"There is no intention of impinging on the sovereignty of any Member State."
"There is a report, for which Mr Barnier is responsible, on the table in the Council, which provides a good basis for this work."
"I would like to know whether the Council intends to pursue this issue."
"The European Parliament will undoubtedly give its enthusiastic support, and Europeans will be grateful for that."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, no region can cope unaided with natural disasters, whether these be forest fires, earthquakes or floods."
"Fighting them, and, moreover, coping with their aftermath, goes beyond the capacities of regional authorities, and so the regions affected are reliant on solidarity, primarily on aid from neighbouring regions and support from the national level, with which responsibility for civil protection and disaster prevention lies."
"I would like to make it clear that we have no need of new powers at European level, which would duplicate structures and waste money on administrative apparatus."
"I also find somewhat problematic the idea of using European money from the structural funds or even money intended for rural development."
"European policy for rural areas looks towards the future; it supports the nation states in their regional investment strategies in international competition."
"There are those who are now demanding that these valuable resources be put to work in preventing forest fires and compensating their victims, and, on that front too, I have to say that it does not seem to make much sense to use European taxpayers' money for such things as firebreaks."
"As we all know, the European Solidarity Fund is there to deal with really major disasters, for those very situations in which individual countries are unable to cope with natural calamities, but I would demand that this fund be more flexible in its use of money."
"I also call for more binding rules on the international coordination of crisis interventions, initially bilaterally between the states concerned and in exceptional cases at the European level too, but, please, let there be no new European superstructures in the civil protection field and no more wasting of valuable European resources on tasks that really should, in the main, be left to the nation states!"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in drafting its answer, the Council has gone on the assumption that the honourable Members wish to know how the Union's civil protection services are to be developed and taken forward by the Council."
"Their introductory speeches have now confirmed that our assumption was correct and that this is indeed the issue."
"The primary goal in the work of the Council is to establish better coordination to ensure that assistance interventions function more efficiently."
"The Council will rely on this in existing structures, such as the civil protection monitoring and information centre that operates in association with the Commission and the Secretariat-General of the Council of the European Union."
"The second goal of the Council's work is to provide assistance quickly wherever it is needed."
"The Member States themselves have the main responsibility for providing assistance in emergencies."
"With reference to a Commission proposal for establishing a financial instrument for emergency services and rapid assistance interventions, the Council is examining whether, with certain conditions in place, a proportion of the Community budget appropriations allocated for EU civil protection operations could be used for the hire of transport and equipment."
"All this shows that the Council considers it very important to strengthen the European Union's preparedness in the area of civil protection."
"Mr President, the fact that this is the third time in recent months that we have discussed this issue demonstrates the enhanced sensitivity of the European Parliament."
"I have pointed out on another occasion that it is a paradox that we have a common policy for farmers, the environment and regional development, but have no policy for the natural disasters that affect farmers and regional development and the environment."
"This is a paradox in the functioning of the European Union to date."
"Furthermore, I consider that indifference on these issues is also strengthening Euro-scepticism."
"The image of the European Union would be much more positive if there were a European mechanism and if the European Union were present after any natural disaster at the problem faced at that moment by the citizens."
"We need to understand this."
"I do not think that particular thought is needed in order to adopt this perception."
"We do not want substitution of the Member States."
"Of course the Member States will also continue to be present, but what we want is for there to be coordination."
"Minister, it was the Council that called on Mr Βarnier, a distinguished European and successful Commissioner, to table a proposal to you, not us."
"You noted the Council proposal in June and, since then, the proposal has remained without there being any development."
"You need to tell us something."
"I know that you do not merely represent your country here; you represent 25 countries and you must coordinate between yourselves, really coordinate."
"Months have gone past."
"Must we wait again for disasters as happened in Germany in 2002 before we do something?"
"At that time, the disasters were the reason we set up the Solidarity Fund."
"We cannot proceed in this fashion."
"You need to say something clearer at some point and you have time up to December to raise the matter and to follow up the Barnier report."
"You owe it to yourselves, because you called on him to draft that report, and you owe it, above all, to the citizens of Europe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as times change, so do needs."
"The climate is no longer what it was dozens of years ago."
"All year round, parched dry days alternate with days of torrential rain."
"'Climate change is not science fiction', said Kofi Annan today as he opened the Climate Change Conference in Nairobi."
"Insurance experts have predicted that natural disasters will cause EUR 2.3 billion's worth of damage in 2040."
"Climate change lies at the root of natural disasters throughout the world that have left a trail of destruction and death in their wake."
"Global warming is one of the major problems of our times."
"It is necessary to raise awareness among the citizens and encourage them to take part in the prevention of these disasters, although responsibility for managing the response to natural disasters rests primarily with the country affected, with the Union playing a supporting role."
"The Community civil protection mechanism must be strengthened with greater resources and more wide-ranging powers."
"This indeed was what you said, Mrs Lehtomäki, but what actual form will this process of strengthening take?"
"What is the Council thinking of doing to enhance the European Civil Protection mechanism?"
"Does the Council support the idea of creating a European Strategic Coordination Centre responsible for gathering and disseminating information on emergencies and for making rapid reaction resources available for combating the different types of disaster?"
"What does the Council intend to do with the Barnier report, as mentioned earlier?"
"These are the questions to which we would like answers."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one area in which all Europeans expect effective Community responses, it is that of large-scale natural disasters."
"Everyone has seen how, whenever major disasters such as the tsunami occur, there is a quick response on the part not only of individual countries and NGOs but also of our fellow citizens who, through their gifts of money, clothes and time, are able to join forces and take action."
"However, we have also seen, when each of these disasters has occurred, that what was missing was proper organisation."
"We are indeed confronted by inadequate organisation."
"That is why, together with my group, I am in favour of implementing preventative actions and of putting in place the capacity to respond very quickly to the consequences of tragedies."
"In this connection, I should like to draw attention to the quality of the Barnier report, which states the problem well and proposes solutions that are constructive not only - my fellow Members have already emphasised this - in terms, as one would expect, of efficiency but also of subsidiarity."
"At this stage, I should like to point out where this report scores."
"Although no one questions the fact that it is for the various military organisations, fire services and other players of various kinds to exercise their responsibilities in full, it has to be acknowledged that only the European Union is in a position to ensure preventative and responsive coordination."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that the European Union has thus had the opportunity to demonstrate at a global level that the word 'solidarity' is not devoid of meaning but may be translated as 'practical action'."
"If, when disasters similar to those of the past occur - and there is, unfortunately, a danger of their doing so in 2007 - the European Union has a presence on the ground in order to offer a response to human suffering and to mitigate the material, technical and ecological disasters, it will be viewed by the world as a more unified and much more practical enterprise."
"For this reason too, it is important for the Presidency successfully to carry out this operation as early as at the beginning of 2007."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - There are indeed two aspects."
"There are disasters, natural and man-made, and there is terrorist attack."
"Allow me to speak from the perspective of the UK, where we have experienced both of those within the last year."
"Last December, at an oil-storage depot near London, we had the biggest fire in peacetime Europe."
"In July there was a serious terrorist attack in central London, with three tube trains bombed below ground and a bus above ground."
"In each case we coped. And it is more than just a question of subsidiarity."
"We do not want to become dependent - and neither should anybody else."
"So, I have a question."
"What do you mean by 'European Consulates'?"
"Are these to be imposed upon national systems, over and above them?"
"Another question: the European Civil Defence Force referred to in the Barnier report - what is it going to do?"
"Is it an armed unit?"
"If so, under whose control?"
"Based where?"
"Could it be deployed without national government request or permission?"
"Finally, the Constitution included a European policy on the prevention of natural disasters and on civil protection."
"A further question: is this an attempt to introduce parts of the dead Constitution into new legislation?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become very clear from this debate that the Council, Parliament and surely the Commission too share exactly the same goals."
"Firstly, we have to be able to establish effective arrangements for coordination in the field of civil protection."
"The other goal that we share is that assistance should go wherever it is needed efficiently."
"It is worth bearing in mind that a high level of cooperation will be needed to achieve these shared goals."
"We do not necessarily or automatically need new structures, and we should not imagine that something will run well merely by creating a new structure."
"Cooperation is therefore paramount, and is a keyword here."
"Furthermore, when we speak of certain natural disasters we have to remember, particularly when they occur outside the European Union, that there are a lot of players other than the European Union in the field."
"In such situations, the Union needs to be part of a wider internationally coordinated operation."
"The need for coordination in the field was very evident when the tsunami disaster struck, when there were dozens, even hundreds, of players in the field at the same time."
"Mr Barnier's proposals are now being considered and digested by the Member States."
"They are very ambitious, and right now the work of the Council work is focussed on finalising decisions on the financial instrument, leading to a common civil protection instrument."
"Work is also nevertheless continuing with respect to Mr Barnier's proposals, and he has been invited to present his ideas at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 5 December."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(IT) This umpteenth and timely question on the sensitive matter of EU civil protection capacity puts the spotlight on one of the most convoluted and controversial sectors that the Member States have ever had to deal with."
"As I have said before - I have talked to the Commission on a number of occasions and expressed my views in this House - since the civil protection sector is a matter for the individual Member States, it inevitably comes up against very different laws, types of professional training and practices."
"For that reason, I have for some time supported the idea of capacity building and strengthening the coordination of the national intervention forces, with the aim of rendering the various national legislations more homogeneous."
"In my view, such action has to be delegated to a special European Civil Protection Agency, on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency."
"Recent experience has taught us that, if you look beyond the willingness shown, for example, when the horrific tsunami hit part of the Indian Ocean in 2004, the European Union's emergency management is, I am sorry to say, utterly inadequate."
"(FR) The strategy developed in the excellent Barnier report with a view to making the most of the very considerable efforts made by Europeans in the field of emergency aid could supplement the Community civil protection mechanism instituted in 2001, whether the crisis were internal or external to the EU."
"I particularly approve of the proposal aimed at basing this force in the EU's seven outermost regions, which give Europe a human and territorial presence off the African coast - the Canaries and Madeira - in the Indian Ocean - Réunion - and in or close to the Americas - Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe and the Azores - not to mention the overseas territories in the Pacific: French Polynesia and New Caledonia."
"We must follow the example of the French Red Cross, which has created overseas-based teams for responding to humanitarian crises."
"These are capable of rushing to the area concerned in less than 24 hours, setting up emergency hospitals and providing tents, medicines, water supplies, telecommunications and logistical support."
"In order to give practical expression to the 'Europe of projects', the European Union must take initiatives inspired by a clear, comprehensible and strong political will."
"Enhanced civil protection on the part of Europe would involve a federative dimension, strongly identifying the action concerned as European, and, in accordance with the principle of solidarity dear to our Community, would represent a source of pride for our fellow citizens."
"Framework for European Regulatory Agencies (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the framework for European regulatory agencies."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its citizens need effective agencies that work transparently."
"As you know, in order to promote this objective, on 28 June 2004 the Council adopted conclusions on the Commission communication on the operating framework for the European Regulatory Agencies."
"In these conclusions, the Council focussed attention on the Commission's intention to put forward the proposal as a legally binding instrument, which would define the Regulatory Agencies' horizontal operating framework."
"It was the Council's opinion that the proposal should deal with such issues as the establishment, work and monitoring of regulatory agencies, to ensure, in particular, that there would be consistency, transparency, good governance, credibility and cost-effectiveness, and that their activities would be lawful."
"Afterwards, in February 2005, the Commission drafted an interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the European Regulatory Agencies."
"The proposal stated that the purpose of the interinstitutional agreement was to reinforce the horizontal framework for the establishment, structure, work, evaluation and monitoring of the Regulatory Agencies."
"When the draft was being considered at working group level, however, the Council, in April 2005, took the view that there could be no agreement on the issue in the form of an interinstitutional agreement, at least in terms of its content."
"Nor was it considered possible to admit any legal basis for the Regulatory Agencies, because there is none in the Treaty for a legal act of this kind. In Council discussions, various models were proposed for moving forward in this matter."
"There was no agreement, however, on how this could be achieved."
"During our Presidency, we have pondered various options for establishing an interinstitutional agreement on the Regulatory Agencies."
"We have been paying particular attention to the content of the Commission's proposal and the matter of a legal basis."
"The time has never been ripe, however, for a completely new proposal by the Commission."
"So fresh talks on the matter have also been impossible to organise."
"It is nonetheless clear that there is a need for more discussions on both the content of any forthcoming Commission proposal as well as its format."
"It is important to remember that any horizontal operating framework in respect of the agencies must also function practically."
"There needs to be a guarantee that there is a real need for their establishment and work, with a proper analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the project."
"The Finnish Presidency is very aware that the European Parliament has focussed its attention on this matter on several occasions."
"In its draft for an interinstitutional agreement, the Commission stressed that the Regulatory Bodies would have a public service function to perform."
"They would improve the implementation and application of Community rules everywhere in the European Union."
"Thus, it is not just a question of the creation of a legally binding framework to enhance the work of the Union."
"We need to show the general public that the Union is trying to step up progress on issues that are important to them, credibly and cost-effectively, and in this case with the help of Regulatory Agencies."
"Vice-president of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission still considers that an interinstitutional agreement seems the best solution for a framework for regulatory agencies."
"Only this legal instrument has the advantage of involving the three institutions from the outset and allows all three to agree good rules of governance applicable to regulatory agencies."
"The recent creation of a number of new agencies, with more on the way, makes the case for progress still stronger."
"We now have 21 agencies under the first pillar with 2 more on the way: the Gender Institute and the Chemicals Agency to be created under the REACH regulation."
"We all seem to agree on the desirability of action."
"If the problem is the instrument by which we should move forward and the proposed interinstitutional agreement is questioned, then the Council needs to explain what alternative it proposes."
"The Commission is prepared to consider alternatives but needs to know how the Council would like to take this matter forward."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, the function of European regulatory agencies is closely linked both to multi-level European governance and to the European strategy on better lawmaking."
"The state of interinstitutional inertia which this issue has reached leads me to address the following questions to the Council and to the Commission:"
"First, do the basic terms and criteria for the operating framework of the regulatory agencies need to be defined or not?"
"Secondly, the number of regulatory agencies appears to be on the increase, thereby exacerbating fragmentation and a lack of transparency and uniformity."
"Will the Commission and the Council help towards rationalisation, transparency, democratic control and a horizontal approach to regulatory agencies?"
"Thirdly, the Commission has postponed its initiative."
"The European Parliament has also, in turn, formulated its positions ambiguously."
"Should the institutional diplomacy of silence on the part of the Council be interpreted as the postponement of the matter ad calendas grecas?"
"Fourthly, does the Council - and we expect a clear answer - consider the Commission's draft interinstitutional agreement to be a live text?"
"Fifthly, is the Commission prepared, should the Council take action, to reassess its draft and to restore it with new wording, so that it can form the basis for an interinstitutional agreement?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this state of affairs is, indeed, completely unsatisfactory."
"There are 21 European agencies and a confusing plethora of models, all of them impenetrable to the public and Europe's citizens, even, indeed, to the bodies - such as this Parliament - representing them."
"It is no good example of good and proper government that it should no longer be possible to gain an insight into what goes on in them."
"As long ago as 2003, we warned that new arrangements would have to be made for these agencies, and we said so again in 2005; another year has now gone by, and nothing has happened."
"Things cannot carry on like this."
"The presidency really must make the effort to establish consensus in the Council as to how it may join with the other institutions - the Commission and Parliament - in putting together an agreement on the administration and accountability of these agencies."
"As has been said, we are dealing here with things that the public are interested in; the Food Safety Authority, the Medicines Agency, the Chemicals Agency, the Environment Agency - all these have to do with things in which the people out there are interested, and if nobody has a clue as to who is responsible or how they work it is hardly surprising that people find European politics frustrating."
"I have to tell the President-in-Office that what the Council is actually doing is forcing Parliament to have recourse to sharper weapons, for she will have seen how the Committee on Budgets did not release the funds for the new agencies, even though we actually want them."
"The funds for the human rights agency, the Agency for Gender Equality and the Chemicals Agency, rather than being released, have been put in reserve in what is almost an emergency operation aimed at compelling the Council to clarify matters once and for all, and I hope that she will succeed in getting things moving on this front."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think it is fair to remind ourselves what would be the position without the existence of these regulatory agencies performing a vital supervisory function at the federal level."
"If they were not to exist, the Commission would need to grow one vast centralised bureaucracy and appoint an army of prefects and inspecteurs de finances to patrol the Union."
"But we should develop a far less spontaneous and more coordinated approach to setting up the agencies."
"They should become an example of modern European governance: consultative, transparent, autonomous and accountable."
"Parliament itself should exercise a greater degree of self-restraint here and retain a dispassionate scrutiny, so that we are able to exercise our authority for the discharge."
"I agree with the Commission that an interinstitutional agreement is sorely needed, but if it is blocked I would ask the Commission to consider a regulation on the basis of Article 308."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I say thank you for the comments which the Presidency has received on this issue from the various teams."
"As I said in my opening speech, this autumn we have thought about and tried to find different alternatives to this interinstitutional agreement."
"The particularly crucial aspects of the Commission's proposal are its content and the issue of a legal basis."
"It is absolutely essential that we create a regulatory environment and an operating framework that function successfully, rationally and cost-effectively, where it concerns practical matters as well."
"We clearly need continued debate among the Member States to hone this project, and we shall endeavour to promote and fine-tune this debate throughout our presidential term."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, this could be the right moment to repeat the common set of good governance principles that the Commission wanted to include in an interinstitutional agreement to oversee and help the functioning of these agencies, because it would give a definition of these agencies and would create rules on their creation, structure and functioning, including issues of transparency, evaluation and control."
"In all this discussion about the format, it is important to remember the content."
"We in the Commission are ready to explore the option mentioned by Mr Duff of considering a regulation under Article 308."
"We are open to exploring that option."
"However, as far as the decision-making process is concerned, the European Parliament, for example, would only have a consultative role in the content of the future regulation."
"That is why our preference was for an interinstitutional agreement."
"Finally, I can only express our hopes for a dialogue on these issues."
"We shall continue to look for the most appropriate, effective and cost-effective method to deal with these necessary issues to try to establish some common rules and a common set of good governance principles for the agencies."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.35 p.m.)"
"As I explained earlier, the sitting was suspended because Parliament's work was running ahead of time for the first time in this legislative period."
"A Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a Baltic Sea strategy for the northern dimension."
"This Presidency also takes note that you are desperate for a Mediterranean holiday."
"We shall ask the Italian delegation to invite you down."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament plenary part-session is this week discussing several issues to do with the sea, as it is now with the Baltic Sea strategy."
"The Presidency is delighted that regional issues are being discussed as part of a wider whole."
"On Monday you held a debate on the EU marine environment strategy and directive, which again are a component in the EU's maritime policy now being prepared."
"The parliamentary conference on the Northern Dimension planned for next spring is a welcome example of Parliament's interest in Nordic issues."
"Baltic Sea issues affect the eight Member States of the Union that border the Baltic, as well as Russia, very directly."
"Norway and Iceland are also involved in Baltic Sea cooperation as members of the Council of Baltic Sea States."
"An important shipping waterway, the Baltic Sea is important for all EU countries."
"Broad, horizontal cooperation is therefore needed both within the Union and between the EU and Russia and other partners on issues of the environment, energy, traffic, training, justice and home affairs and matters of health."
"The Union's common maritime policy presently being drafted will also serve to strengthen this cooperation."
"To achieve concrete results, there will also have to be more effective use made of the Union's internal funding programmes and external relations instruments."
"Furthermore, there will need to be opportunities for cross-border cooperation, which is also supported by the new Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"The rapporteur's speech makes mention of the Northern Dimension, and it is proposed that the Baltic Sea Strategy is part of it, but the Northern Dimension is also a component in the EU's external relations policy."
"It covers the operating sectors in the Four Common Spaces adopted by the EU and Russia, as well as environmental, social and public health issues."
"The Baltic Sea is one of the target areas for the Northern Dimension, along with northwest Russia, Kaliningrad and the Arctic regions."
"One of the aims of the Finnish Presidency is the review of policy under the Northern Dimension on the basis of the decisions taken at the Northern Dimension ministerial meeting held in November last year."
"The new Framework Document for the Northern Dimension was negotiated this year between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland."
"The Framework Document and the Political Declaration connected with it are to be adopted on Friday next week in Helsinki."
"We believe that the new, jointly agreed policy is likely to strengthen the commitment of partners to the Northern Dimension and to provide a firm basis for practical cooperation in the Baltic Region."
"We also hope that a reinforced Northern Dimension will help clarify the work and division of labour associated with the diverse network of cooperation in the Baltic and Arctic Regions."
"The Baltic Sea's ecological state is worrying, and calls for urgent action in accordance with the principles of sustainable development."
"The European Union, individual countries and international financial institutions have pooled their resources within a framework of environmental partnership under the Northern Dimension."
"Several governments, organisations, in particular HELCOM (the Helsinki Commission), and other players are working to rescue the marine environment of the Baltic Sea."
"Northern Dimension environmental partnership projects mainly focus on northwest Russia, but their impact benefits all the countries in the region."
"As a result, the Baltic Sea is, fortunately, already a crucial area for the Northern Dimension."
"A key instrument in the future for improving the state of all European seas, the Baltic included, will be the EU's Marine Strategy Directive."
"Its aim is the achievement of 'good environmental status' by the year 2021."
"It is an ambitious goal, and efforts to attain it must be started immediately."
"The Finnish Presidency will try to find political consensus on the directive in the Council in December."
"The Partnership in Public Health and Social Wellbeing also functions within the framework of the Northern Dimension, and this is aimed at preventing contagious diseases and lifestyle illnesses as well as reducing social problems."
"A new element in the Northern Dimension is also being drafted in the shape of a Transport and Logistics Partnership."
"The importance of viable transport communications and efficient logistics for economic growth and competitiveness is underlined more than ever when our economies are interlinked."
"Right now the European Commission is drafting a new and wide-ranging European maritime policy, one which takes account of the economic, political and environmental values associated with Europe's seas and coastal areas."
"The Baltic Sea is one important sea area in Europe, and special attention should be paid to its special problems."
"That is also true when it comes to developing the EU's maritime policy."
"This evening's debate certainly serves this purpose."
"The EU's maritime policy will be a good opportunity for cooperation among the Member States."
"This is necessary, as the special characteristics of the northern and Arctic regions and exploitation of the region's potential will require joint research projects and technological development on the part of the EU Member States."
"In cooperation with third countries typical of the region, existing international agreements and organisations are made use of."
"The large number of challenges in the Baltic Sea area, such as marine conservation, safety at sea, fishing, sustainable use of coastlines and the development of the region's maritime sector, all call for effective, horizontal cooperation."
"The Baltic Sea area is a splendid opportunity to test the EU's maritime policy now being drafted and make it beneficial to the entire Union."
"The Baltic Sea issue is important, and it is a positive sign that serious attention is being paid to it in the European Union and here in Parliament."
"I just have to say that some of the rapporteur's ideas, these Ten Commandments, are already a reality."
"It is beneficial and vital to the Baltic question that all the countries in the region are involved in the programme of cooperation and that they are genuinely committed to resolving the challenges that they share."
"It is this kind of joint commitment that we need to strive to accomplish in cooperation on the Baltic Sea."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission is most grateful to Mr Stubb for his report, and welcomes the opportunity for a debate."
"There is no mistaking his commitment and determination."
"The Baltic Sea is a very important sea for the European Union, since eight of the nine countries with a Baltic shoreline are EU Member States."
"It is a meeting point for the European Union and Russia."
"With this in mind, the new Northern Dimension Policy Framework Document, to be adopted later this month, will have as its priority areas the Baltic and Barents Seas, Kaliningrad and the Arctic."
"The new Northern Dimension policy will be the regional expression, in the North, of the EU-Russia Common Spaces, with the full involvement of Norway and Iceland."
"The Northern Dimension will also have its own priorities: health and social wellbeing and the protection of indigenous peoples in the High North, as well as particular emphasis on the environment and culture."
"A common new Northern Dimension policy implies that all the partners will be bound by the same goal: its success."
"Accordingly, cofinancing will be the rule, particularly in a context of an increasingly wealthy Russian Federation."
"The Northern Dimension should not only be project-oriented, it should ensure a continuous policy dialogue on the various challenges and opportunities."
"The four Northern Regional Councils the Baltic, Barents, Nordic and Arctic Councils are important actors in this dialogue."
"The Commission is grateful for the attention Parliament has paid to this policy, and particularly for its resolution of 16 November 2005 ahead of the Northern Dimension ministerial meeting."
"The Commission also commends the Parliament's initiative to call for the first conference of a Northern Dimension Parliamentary Forum early next year."
"As for a Baltic Strategy within the Northern Dimension that we are discussing today, the Commission will bear this report by Parliament in mind during the discussions at the Northern Dimension event at which the new policy is to be adopted and which will be held back to back with the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki in the presence of the Prime Ministers of Norway and Iceland."
"The Northern Dimension is an EU external policy, but it is clearly important to improve the inter-relationship between EU internal policies and the Northern Dimension."
"That is why the Commission gives such priority to cross-border cooperation, which is one of the main value-added elements of the Northern Dimension."
"This is indeed a field where internal and external policies necessarily meld together."
"The Baltic Sea is now a Northern Dimension priority because we are concerned about its fragile environment and the increasing traffic through its waters, as is correctly highlighted in the report."
"There are other less tangible threats to the citizens of the Baltic Sea region, including the fight against organised crime, human trafficking, transmissible diseases and unhealthy lifestyles."
"All of these require our close cooperation with Russia, as well as with Norway and Iceland."
"Furthermore, we see great potential for economic cooperation across the Baltic Sea with Russia."
"These are all important objectives to which the Northern Dimension can make a great contribution and which will be elaborated upon in the future."
"EU internal policies, with their own tasks and their own instruments, will of course also make a major contribution to meeting these challenges in EU Member States in the Baltic Sea region, and these should be debated in the appropriate contexts."
"The Commission looks forward to using the new Northern Dimension policy to provide added value in a forum embracing Russia, Norway and Iceland in order to meet the many challenges facing the northern part of our continent."
"In this context, the Commission welcomes the report by Parliament and will certainly convey the importance of the Baltic Sea region."
"I will try to integrate relevant elements of this report into the implementation of the new common Northern Dimension policy."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I would like to focus on three of the issues raised in my committee's opinion."
"First, I would like to stress our view of the importance of further exploitation of offshore wind energy in the Baltic and the demonstration of different types of wave energy concepts."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the importance of developing further cooperation with Russia."
"We want to cooperate on energy matters that ensure respect for the principles of reciprocity and transparency and we want to encourage Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on transit."
"We have a concern about the supply of gas from Russia to Europe."
"Thirdly, we invite Northern Dimension member countries to be aware of the importance of two EU programmes in our committee's area of responsibility: Galileo and SESAR, because we believe that the commitment of northern dimension parties to both of these would reinforce sustainable growth and competitiveness in the region."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - My prepared speech has been brilliantly summarised by Mr Stubb, the rapporteur, so I should simply like to put two questions."
"First of all to the Minister, Mrs Lehtomäki, would she accept that, as the debate has already underlined, circumstances have completely changed since Finland first devised the Northern Dimension?"
"In other words, there are now eight EU Member States, not four, around the Baltic Sea, not all of which see the Northern Dimension in the same light."
"The reason, for example, that the EU-Russia embellishment process has been stalled, as we know, is that Poland has a reserve over Russia's refusal to ratify the Energy Charter."
"So would she accept that it would be very helpful at the Council of Ministers, at the preparatory phase of the Northern Dimension discussions and negotiations, first to have an internal EU discussion involving the eight EU Baltic States?"
"Secondly, I am very grateful to Commissioner Wallström for her comments and for agreeing to incorporate much of the report into the Commission's thinking about evolving and developing the Northern Dimension into the future."
"But she did, I think, neglect to refer to the budget."
"It seems to me that this is not a question of Parliament coming cap in hand, begging for support."
"We are, after all, an arm of the EU's budgetary authority; it therefore seems to me logical and coherent that, if this is going to be an important element, there would be mechanisms and systems whereby, just as in other parts of the EU - EuroMed for example - we have a dedicated budget."
"We should give serious consideration to this and not brush it under the carpet."
"My final point is addressed again to Commissioner Wallström, and concerns communication, which is her brief."
"It seems that this is an exercise which can bring a real message of accomplishment and achievement to the citizens of the EU, to show that a region dislocated completely by the Cold War can now have harmony, prosperity and stability restored."
"So I think this debate should be taken out into the field, to the public, to show a real success story for the EU."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (LT) The Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension is certainly a significant document."
"It reflects the merit of Alexander Stubb, the rapporteur, and the entire Baltic European Intergroup who have worked hard on it."
"The storms of the Cold War have caused larger damage to the Baltic coast than to any other sea coast in terms of political, economic and ecological damage."
"We can feel it even now, when the Baltic Sea is becoming an internal sea of the EU."
"The intervening Russian coast provides a great opportunity to cooperate with this country."
"The region, with its population of 85 million, is one of the economically and socially strongest in the EU; the welfare state model is implemented in many areas here."
"However, differences in the standards of living among these countries are shocking, and the increase of social exclusion in some places is threatening."
"This Strategy should help to overcome such trends."
"Particular attention has been paid to environmental protection, economy and transportation."
"All three elements of this triad are highly dependent on energy and energy security, which is violated when any one country exerts excessive potential or ambition."
"Therefore, the countries in the region need a common energy market."
"Even more attention should be paid to efficient energy use and to renewable energy resources."
"Discussions and specific actions concerning nuclear energy are inevitable."
"At the beginning of December, a power bridge will link Estonia and Finland and it must be reinforced with similar bridges between Lithuania and Sweden, and Lithuania and Poland."
"The Strategy urges more rapid and firm networking of highways, railways and seaways in Northern and Central Europe."
"Poland is right at the main crossroads."
"If Warsaw fails to pay more attention to these projects, they will remain on paper for a long time."
"The Baltic Sea is shallow and very vulnerable ecologically."
"More than 60 tanker accidents and 400 illegal oil spills at sea are recorded every year."
"The sea absorbs the unprocessed wastewater of a population of over a million living along the coast."
"Therefore, seacoast protection zones must be established and extended, and more restrictive environmental protection standards must be applied than the ones presently provided for in the EU directives."
"The European Union would like to have not merely a good but also a reliable neighbour in the Kaliningrad Region of the Russian Federation."
"Georgiy Boos, the governor of the region, is treating Kaliningrad as a Russian window on Europe, as well as the EU's on Russia."
"We would like this window to be wide open to fresh winds of cooperation."
"A wider opening of this window, or an opposite process, would manifest the direction that Russia is moving in."
"The proposal to assign a separate budget line for funding this Strategy would demonstrate the affinity and innovation of the Baltic region."
"I am convinced of its worth, since it may and must become a laboratory for new ideas, projects and innovations which are equally significant on a larger scale."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the Northern Dimension is being strengthened in a way that is gratifying."
"Here in the European Parliament we presented an initiative last year on a Baltic Sea Strategy realised within the framework of the Northern Dimension, and now we have a special report on it."
"It covers cooperation between the EU and its Member States, on the one hand, and cooperation with Russia, on the other."
"The Commission and the Council have themselves negotiated agreements with Russia, Norway and Iceland, whereby the Northern Dimension of the Union's external relations policy will be a policy common to these countries and the Union."
"These agreements are to be signed at the end of November in Helsinki."
"The Commission should draw up a proposal for a Baltic Sea Strategy, as requested by Parliament, as soon as possible."
"The Strategy should cover all areas of policy and both internal and external policy."
"Its preparation and implementation will require the input of all the Commission's Directorates-General, and it should be financed out of all the relevant budget lines."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe does not think it wise to have a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"We are now amassing budget funds for neighbouring regions in the shape of the new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"No good purpose will be served in splitting it up into new budget lines, and it would not increase funding for the Baltic Sea area; in fact it would more likely have the opposite effect."
"It is of course a sexy notion that Mr Stubb has frequently spoken about, but we have to consider things from the point of view of substance, and not image."
"The next step could be that the European Parliament might draft a new comprehensive report on the Northern Dimension that would take account of the Baltic Sea report now being discussed, on the one hand, and the agreements concluded with our neighbouring countries, Russia, Norway and Iceland, on the other."
"I would finally like to thank Mr Stubb for his excellent levels of cooperation in drafting this report."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Alexander Stubb on his excellent report."
"The enlargement of the European Union to take in the Baltic States created an objective need for a revised Northern Dimension instrument."
"The accession of the new Member States is opening up unprecedented opportunities."
"The Baltic Sea region may become the most dynamic and competitive region in the world, and this will be a huge benefit for the entire European Union economy in helping to make the Lisbon Strategy a reality."
"The Northern Dimension must become a permanent instrument, identifying the Baltic Sea region as a priority."
"It is very important to strengthen its internal pillar."
"If the states in the region create a common energy market and promote the use of renewable sources of energy as well as energy efficiency projects, they have an opportunity to reduce their energy dependence on Russia."
"In the formulation of new energy projects it is very important to involve all the European Union Member States that are stakeholders and to carry out an international environmental impact assessment, so that we may avoid a recurrence of the current situation with the potential construction of the North European gas pipeline."
"The development of cooperation with Russia is one of the Northern Dimension's important tasks."
"The Baltic States have a significant history of relations with Russia and accumulated experience that may produce good results."
"At the moment Russia - which in terms of resources is one of the richest countries in the world - is in some curious way still receiving assistance from various European Union programmes."
"The principle of parity and cooperation should replace such an approach."
"In order for the Northern Dimension to be able to carry out its tasks, it needs a stable financial basis."
"On this point, our views differ from the previous speaker, and we think that a separate budget line is necessary, to add to the existing resources from various sources."
"This would make it possible to develop highly necessary infrastructure projects, such as Rail Baltica, a Baltic motorway and others."
"- (LT) The Baltic Sea, as it has been previously mentioned today, is the inner sea of the European Union bordered by nine countries, eight of which are Member States of the European Union with the ninth being Russia, specifically its Kaliningrad and St Petersburg regions."
"One third of the EU population lives in these eight Member States, contributing one third of the gross domestic product of the European Union."
"Till now, the Northern Dimension was mostly targeted at the Russian regions; therefore, supplementing it with the Baltic Sea Strategy would enrich the Northern Dimension with additional specific content."
"The Baltic Sea region leads in competitiveness compared with three other EU regions: Central Europe, the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula."
"Over the last few years, the Baltic Sea region has taken the lead over other European regions in terms of such indicators as wellbeing, productivity growth and scientific innovation."
"The key advantages of this region are a good physical infrastructure, qualified labour force, low level of corruption and strong research sector."
"Nevertheless, the poorly implemented competitive potential of the region must be noted."
"Since not a single country here has a market of sufficient size to develop necessary competitive pressure; therefore, the solution is clear, that is to increase the integration of the region."
"The European Parliament should approve an article of our resolution suggesting (start of quote): 'in pursuit of transparency and consistency (...), to assign the Baltic Sea Strategy a separate budget line, most likely under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, where, along with the current funding of the Northern Dimension, additional funds would be provided' (end of quote)."
"Apprehensions about the European Commission declining to pursue this idea are groundless."
"It is much more important to persuade the EU Member States, especially those outside this region, to support this Strategy, since better integration of this region presents potential not only for the whole EU becoming more dynamic and competitive, but also for resolving other EU issues, such as energy security, common energy policy and better relations with Russia."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament's resolution supports the Northern Dimension policy and defines the North Sea region as a priority area."
"Since enlargement in 2004, the Baltic Sea has virtually become an internal sea, the 'Mare Nostrum', of the European Union."
"The Baltic region could become an example of the most dynamic economic region in the European Union, evidence of the development of a European economy based on cutting-edge technology, an economy that is modern and competitive on a global scale."
"In this context, we must stress the need to protect the Baltic Sea ecosystem, which is extremely vulnerable as the Sea is shallow, its waters circulate slowly and pollution levels are high."
"Particular attention must be paid to promoting innovation in the field of research and raising the issues of culture and civil society."
"The Baltic Sea, which links the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland, should become an example of an area of peace and security."
"I would particularly like to highlight the opportunities which exist for transforming the Kaliningrad rayon into a pilot region, with better access to the internal market."
"These opportunities have been discussed in joint talks between the European Union and Russia."
"Cooperation in the Baltic Sea region could point the way forward in this part of our continent, and mark out a way towards cooperation with Russia and other countries."
"Mr President, of course we congratulate the rapporteur on his report and the points of interest it has raised, but I would not be fulfilling my role as President of this Parliament's Delegation for Relations with Iceland and Norway if I did not express some regret at the absence of a report or a resolution that expressed the full sweep of the Northern Dimension policy."
"I regret that fact because I feel that we are, therefore, neglecting the big geopolitical issues that face us in the High North that find their focus in climate change, in energy supply, in marine resources."
"Of course those issues concern the Baltic hugely, but they also concern the Arctic and the High North. And if we want to bring our partner countries, Norway and Iceland, with us, then we have to reach out and not be inward-looking."
"We have previously striven, as a Parliament, when we have talked about this issue, to bring the Northern Dimension away from just a ministerial level of policy."
"We have striven to bring it back to parliamentarians, into the ownership of parliamentarians across the region."
"I hope we will be able to do that in the meeting we seek to host at the beginning of next year."
"But let me emphasise again: the Northern Dimension should not be just about us."
"This year the Commission concluded a very important agreement with Greenland."
"It may be a small thing, but it shows that the Arctic window is open and should remain open, and that there should be activity beyond our borders."
"Next year is International Polar Year."
"I hope that we will raise both our vision and our eyes to the High North and give it the focus and the attention it deserves next year within the Northern Dimension policy."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on having prepared a good report on the future of the Baltic Sea."
"When we discuss the specific characteristics of the region, however, we should not forget important factors which have shaped its character, which include historical factors, such as the stocks of chemical weapons from World War II that remain at the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"There is also the matter of a delicate ecosystem, additionally threatened by an increased volume of sea transport and planned investments, such as the construction of a northern gas pipeline, which could lead to an ecological disaster."
"Before undertaking such activities, it is vital to carry out a very careful analysis of their potential influence on the natural environment."
"It is also important to set up a consultation procedure with the interested parties and be prepared to amend any planned work if it turns out that it may have a negative impact on the ecosystem of the Baltic."
"Ecological issues and national interests in the region also have to be taken into account when building the planned marine highway."
"We need to ensure that there is equal access to Baltic sea ports and the benefits the motorway will provide."
"It is also important to ensure close cooperation between the Member States in the building energy networks, and solidarity amongst the European Union Member States in their relations with Russia."
"At the moment, Poland is blocking any agreement with Russia, until Russia opens its doors to our meat and agricultural products."
"The European Union has responded by saying that the West has no intention of freezing for the sake of Polish sausages."
"We remember the expression 'we don't want to die for the sake of Gdańsk', and we all know how that story ended."
"(Applause)"
"- (LT) Mr President, the report being discussed is an important step for the whole European Union."
"A change in the political thinking of the New Age is coming to the fore which could be characterised by the concept of 'discovering the Baltic'."
"The Baltic Sea consists of water, its coast and bottom, just as other seas."
"The Baltic waters are shallow and the worst polluted among all of Europe's Atlantic seas."
"The bottom of the Baltic Sea is already dead in many places, and whether a new Dead Sea will emerge in Europe depends on us."
"This process was accelerated by many German chemical weapons submerged here at the end of World War II, including bombs and canon balls with dioxin, mustard gas and other 'souvenirs' which are starting to pose hazards after 60 years of corrosion."
"This constitutes a threat of tremendous catastrophe, both to the water and the coast."
"The coast is particularly attractive for its white sandy beaches and pine forests; the Curonian Spit is part of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage registry."
"Its beauty is a creation of nature and people; now, people are likely to destroy it and nature is unable to defend it."
"The eastern coast of the sea is populated by ancient nations not willing to submit to ecological catastrophes caused by post-Soviet capitalism."
"Today, I would like to emphasise not only the responsibility of Gazprom, but also of the German Government, for the outcomes of the Russian-German agreement concerning the so-called Northern Gas Pipeline, if repositories of lethal poisons at the bottom of the Baltic Sea are affected during construction."
"The European Union, which blessed the funding of the pipeline without any investigation or warranty, should take even greater responsibility for the manifold negative outcomes of this alleged 'good business', meaning responsibility for the outcomes of economic discrimination and the political disintegration of Europe, as well as the ecological and demographic outcomes of potential disasters."
"It is good that we will adopt this initial European Baltic Strategy document and are beginning to realise the responsibility."
"(ET) In January 1990, Finnish prime minister Kalevi Sorsa held a Baltic Sea Parliamentary Conference with the objective of developing new directions in regional cooperation in the new political situation."
"Unfortunately the representatives of the Baltic States were forced to spoil the conference, since we could already clearly see Russia's malevolent behaviour, which was tangibly expressed in the attack against the television tower in Vilnius a few days later."
"We then used the platform to call the world's attention to this danger, and other objectives received less attention."
"We did, however, present a strategic plan on behalf of the Green Party."
"In rereading this, I noticed that, despite the drastic political changes that have taken place, this has not improved the environmental protection of the Baltic Sea itself."
"One of our recommendations was to put an end to all oil transport on the Baltic Sea."
"Instead, the volume of oil transport rose threefold."
"The Russian newspaper Независимая газета (Independent Newspaper) yesterday printed an article on the Baltic Sea gas pipeline."
"The article claims that a proposal will now be made to the Baltic Sea states for the performance of the necessary ecological studies."
"That is excellent, but unfortunately in the wrong order."
"Attention was first devoted to political, then economic and only then to ecological conditions, as a form of decoration, as it were."
"The end of the article is also noteworthy - the opponents of the gas pipeline plan to torpedo the whole operation using ammunition sunk during the Second World War."
"The 6th Gas Pipeline in Urengoy apparently suffered the same fate, which was allegedly the sole reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"I would like to bring to your attention to the fact that all of the conditions were favourable for the timely performance of an ecological assessment in the Baltic Sea, as well as the environmental protection organisation HELCOM and eighty years of academic cooperation."
"In sum: our delegation approves of Alexander Stubb's approach, and wishes to thank him warmly for this."
"We also believe that, in accordance with Stubb's three pillars, there is no need to include the Arctic in the Baltic Sea strategy."
"In our opinion, it would be worth opening - for planned work with the Baltic Sea environment, and much more - a new line in the European Union budget for this sea, which is unique in the world."
"(SV) Mr President, as one of those who first mooted, and then helped to found, the Baltic Europe Intergroup network, I have for two years had the pleasure of contributing to the work that has now led to this report."
"When the EU enlarged to include ten new Member States, it became possible to reunite the nations around the Baltic Sea."
"Now, the heart of the region can give the Northern Dimension its vital spark."
"The EU must make use of the Baltic Sea region's considerable potential."
"The quicker the new Member States can increase their prosperity, the stronger the EU will become in relation to its neighbours."
"If this state of affairs is to be brought about, active measures are required on the part of the EU."
"We therefore need a practical programme from the Commission in which all the areas administered by the latter play their allotted role."
"A strong Baltic Sea region is needed if issues important to the whole of the EU are to be resolved."
"Through direct contacts between people, we must break down the psychological barriers between West and East."
"We need a modern visa policy and better economic cooperation with Russia."
"We must resolve the border disputes in the Baltic, restore the ecological balance in the Baltic Sea, obtain an end to the Russian boycott of Polish foodstuffs and do away with the up to 30-mile-long queues of lorries at the border stations in eastern Finland."
"The EU is there to solve common problems."
"Vetoes need not be the only way of directing attention to important issues."
"A common EU strategy is therefore necessary."
"It is important for the Commission to lose no time in getting to grips with this issue, and Mr Stubb's report is an excellent basis on which to do this."
"(PL) Mr President, the Baltic Sea, which today is virtually an internal sea of the European Union, is a matter of priority for both the economy of the region and the whole European Union."
"Unfortunately, the Baltic is the most polluted area of marine water in the world."
"It therefore needs attention, that is to say a joint strategy and consistent collaboration between the countries of the European Union and Russia to implement this strategy."
"It is therefore fortunate that an agreement on a new political declaration concerning the Northern Dimension and a strategic framework document will be discussed at the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki, on 24 November."
"When tackling the problem of the Baltic Sea, we must remember that around 85 million people live on its shores and that it contains rich and diverse animal and plant life, including many already endangered species."
"For centuries, this sea has fed millions of people and given not only fishermen and their families their livelihoods, but also those engaged in other activities."
"Seafaring people have also created their own culture, which we should protect with no less care than the natural environment, the beauty of the landscape and material wealth."
"That is why we view the planned northern gas pipeline, and the associated dangers of chemical pollution and military mobilisation, with concern."
"The Baltic Sea is a treasure which we have inherited from our forefathers, together with the duty to pass it, and its values, on to future generations."
"Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur, my friend Alexander Stubb, and my colleague Christopher Beazley for his good work as Chairman of the Baltic Intergroup."
"I totally endorse Diana Wallis's remarks about raising the EU's profile in northern Europe."
"The Northern Dimension is a wide-ranging EU policy which governs EU relations with the north-west Russian areas, including Kaliningrad, the Baltic and the Arctic Sea regions."
"The Northern Dimension is implemented within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia."
"It is conceived as a way of working with the countries of Europe's northern regions to increase prosperity, strengthen security and resolutely combat dangers such as the environmental pollution of the Baltic Sea, nuclear risks such as those posed by the Russian submarine fleet in the Kola Peninsula, cross-border crime and the management of marine resources, amongst others."
"Eight EU Member States - Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden - surround the Baltic Sea, and the EU's shared border with Russia has lengthened significantly following enlargement."
"Nevertheless, EU-Russia relations cannot be dictated only by relations between the Baltic states and Russia."
"Our strategic partnership and our collective EU needs for energy security, as well as cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the need to carry Russia in areas like preventing nuclear proliferation from countries like Iran and North Korea, transcend regional issues such as those addressed by the Northern Dimension."
"There is currently financial support from Tacis and Interreg, but shortly Russia will be part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, and the EU should have a proper budget line for the region."
"Climate change is making the Arctic more accessible to human activities now, such as exploitation of natural resources and increased shipping, but the Arctic also has an important role to play as an early-warning sign for potentially catastrophic global climate change."
"Russia's energy exports can also be a political weapon, we have now discovered, as we saw last year in Ukraine and this year with Georgia."
"Now rumours abound that Russia wishes to set up an OPEC-style gas cartel, which we must resist at all costs."
"I call upon President Putin to get around to ratifying the EU Energy Charter, which would give all EU companies more access to Russian oil and gas."
"The EU must also invest more in renewables and low-carbon energy, while encouraging as much diversity in supply as possible."
"(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this is a shared sea, we have given it different names, and we must admit that we have not as yet come to see it as a shared space, or used all of its possibilities."
"Thus I warmly welcome the efforts made by Alexander Stubb and President Toomas Hendrik Ilves in creating this strategy."
"Under the aegis of the Northern Dimension, our shared lake strategy could grow into something even bigger."
"I believe that in a globalising world and a multicultural, even expanding European Union, we all seek new identities, and the Baltic Sea could play an important role here, and become a kind of symbol."
"Throughout history there have been connections between the countries that surround the sea, but cooperation aimed at the development of the region as a whole would take those relations to a new level."
"We would all benefit from this."
"The sea itself, which today is one of the most polluted bodies of water, demands joint action."
"Why indeed do we need this strategy?"
"A common Baltic Sea area will not arise itself or from individual projects; we need coordinated activity ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate Alexander Stubb on an excellent report and thank him for his excellent levels of cooperation."
"I just wish to raise one point, and that is the amendment which Diana Wallis and I tabled on the establishment of a local office in the Baltic Sea area."
"At present, the European Investment Bank operates in 11 EU Member States and 6 countries outside the EU in the Mediterranean region and in Africa."
"Just one branch, the one in Poland, is located in the Baltic Sea region and in a new Member State."
"By contrast, there are eight branches in total in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region."
"A branch office of the EIB was set up last spring in Vienna."
"It is to be responsible for projects in eastern Central Europe and the Balkan region."
"But it is not the function of any branch to be responsible for projects in the new Member States, the Nordic countries or the Baltic countries."
"I think that it is important to establish an office of this kind, responsible for overseeing funding operations in that region and making the Baltic Sea Strategy a reality."
"The presence of such a branch office could also aid large funding projects under the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds during subsequent terms, and in this way facilitate cooperation in the Baltic Sea region and promote major projects there."
"(PL) Mr President, the Northern Dimension of the European Union's external policy is not just a priority for the Finnish presidency."
"It is also an extremely important aspect of Polish foreign policy and the foreign policies of seven other European Union Member States which surround the Baltic Sea."
"During the last dozen years or so, the Baltic has become a region for peaceful cooperation with Russia."
"If we are to maintain this situation, we need to eliminate the dangers that have appeared on the horizon today."
"The main threats today are the growing dependence of the countries in the region on Russian fuel supplies and the series of unsolved problems concerning the Kaliningrad area."
"Addressing these challenges is beyond the capabilities of individual countries and also exceeds those of our group of eight countries."
"It is therefore vital for them to be made a priority for the European Union as a whole."
"Today, 24% of gas supplies come from Russia."
"This percentage will rise in the future."
"The possibility, mentioned by Charles Tannock a moment ago, of Russia creating a gas cartel is additional cause for concern."
"Investments such as the Baltic gas pipeline are increasing the dependence of the entire European Union's on its eastern neighbour."
"In addition they are causing dangerous political tensions between members of the Union itself."
"Today, the Kaliningrad region remains a ticking time bomb."
"We are not only concerned by the level of military mobilisation in the area, but also by the social situation in Kaliningrad."
"A large percentage of the population is infected with AIDS, the natural environment is being destroyed and organised crime is rampant."
"Therefore, if the European Union as a whole fails to take an interest in these issues, there will be no common policy with respect to energy or to Kaliningrad."
"Without a common policy we will all face failure."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to expand on the topic of Kaliningrad, as it does represent a great challenge."
"We had all hoped that Kaliningrad would become for Russia what Hong Kong was for China."
"However, there are fears that it may become what Puerto Rico became for the United States."
"Apart from the dangers mentioned by the previous speaker, Mr Klich, I would also like to point out a further unsolved problem, namely the fact that, 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, there are still huge stocks of weapons in Kaliningrad and no one knows what they are doing there."
"The figures are available because Russia, as a signatory of the Convention on Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, is obliged to make these figures public."
"There are more tanks in Kaliningrad than in the British and French armies combined."
"What exactly are they doing there?"
"As I said, 15 years have passed since the end of the Cold War."
"As a result, we clearly need to try to resolve this complex of problems jointly with Russia, as the entire Baltic region, and its future, largely depends on the future of the Kaliningrad region."
"It is probably the most dynamic region today, and its potential for further dynamic development is enormous."
"Mr President, this is a joint initiative by members of the new Baltic Intergroup, successfully chaired by Christopher Beazley, on the basis of which Alexander Stubb has drawn up a very efficient report."
"I would draw your attention to its underlying ethos, which is not to create a separate region, but to open the Baltic Sea area up to Europe as a whole in the interests of all the EU Member States."
"The Northern Dimension will therefore retain its present foreign policy aspect of cooperation with Russia, Iceland and Norway."
"However, a very important new internal EU cooperation aspect will be added as a priority, which one might call the 'Beazley pillar'."
"This is because we need to make full use of the cooperation potential of the eight Member States around the Baltic Sea."
"Various studies show that the competitiveness index in this region is one of the highest of any European region in terms of growth in prosperity and productivity, scientific innovation, physical infrastructure, a skilled labour force and even a low level of corruption."
"We therefore need to coordinate our efforts to fully harness the four basic freedoms with regard to this region and so achieve a new brand for it as one of the most attractive and rapidly developing in the EU."
"We therefore also need a special budget line, and this would be our contribution to the development of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Finally, I would like to remind the Commission of the first commandment, which is that the Commission should now take the initiative on the basis of this report."
"- (LT) Mr President, I was prepared for a completely different speech, but I am captivated by the Commissioner's idea that we must focus on the issues of an unhealthy lifestyle in the Baltic region."
"The geopolitical importance of this region has been ignored for years, yet the Baltic region acts as a driver of modernisation enabling development of Northern Europe to the Arctic."
"Because of this region, the modernisation of Russia became possible (if one is aware of history)."
"Because of this region, Finland gained its strength. (It is a pity that the Finnish Minister is not taking part in such an important discussion.)"
"Therefore, the significance of the region has been constantly downplayed."
"In my opinion, this report is an opportunity to thank Alexander Stubb for his efforts to give some impetus to the Baltic region, which is actually a driver of modernisation in Northern Europe, and in this case could even be a driver of modernisation for the entire European Union."
"I would also like to second the idea of Mr Beazley that this project matches the key activity of Parliament to bring decision-making closer to the people."
"I hope the Commission will keep this in mind as well."
"(PL) Mr President, I believe that the Baltic Sea will increasingly unite, rather than divide, the countries of this region, by establishing and promoting economic ties, whilst respecting the political rights of these countries, and preserving its natural heritage."
"However, this will not be possible if certain economic interests are promoted at the expense of others, without respect for the principles of good neighbourly cooperation, solidarity and shared responsibility."
"A case in point is the construction of the Northern gas pipeline, which has been mentioned here several times, and is an investment that was made without consulting partners from the Baltic region."
"We have to ask ourselves what our aims and priorities are in terms of closer cooperation within the group of eight Baltic countries."
"On the one hand, we proclaim the need to protect the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea, while on the other we fear an open and honest debate on the environmental issues associated with the construction of the gas pipeline."
"I would like to remind you that, last year, 60 Members of this House tabled a motion for a debate on the environmental aspects of building the gas pipeline."
"This debate never took place."
"The presidents did not include it in the agenda."
"I would also like to inform the representatives of the Council and the Commission that Russia is hindering free travel on the Baltic Sea by not permitting ships to pass through the straits between the Vistula Lagoon and Kaliningrad."
"This means that the port of Elbląg, which was recently renovated with European Union funds, is dying because it has lost access to the open sea."
"It seems that the unilateral interests of Russia, which has its army base on these straits, have been given priority."
"The Baltic strategy has highlighted these dangers, and that is why I would like to thank Alexander Stubb for his report."
"He can count on our support for the aims he seeks to achieve."
"I would also like to thank all the members of the Baltic Intergroup and its leader, Christopher Beazley, for their commitment."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, I have my own personal Northern Dimension, being born in the north of Sweden, so I am sure that my colleague Mrs Ferrero Waldner would have had an easier time keeping a cool head in this debate!"
"I have very much enjoyed listening to this discussion on the Baltic Sea Strategy and to whole debate on the Northern Dimension as a whole."
"Part of challenge is to ensure that the Baltic Sea Strategy is one that embraces all the important elements, and not just those connected to the Northern Dimension."
"I am confident that the new Northern Dimension policy, with its future shared ownership by the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland, will substantially benefit the Baltic Sea region because none of the challenges faced by the Baltic Sea can be tackled without genuine Russian involvement, just as none of the challenges faced by the Barents Sea can be dealt with without Russia and Norway."
"Let me comment on just a few specific issues that have been raised."
"Firstly, regarding the Baltic Sea, investment decisions must of course be taken by investors, but the Commission's viewpoint has been that it is very important that proper environmental impact assessments are made for the implementation of the project, and we have not favoured one route over the other."
"On the Kaliningrad oblast, this has of course been a priority sector for the Northern Dimension policy and will remain so."
"It is also an area of particular attention in our bilateral relations with Russia."
"The transit regime has now been successfully implemented and has been notably facilitated through very substantial EU assistance, on which the Commission expects to present its report by the end of the year."
"Also, although the transit regime is an important issue, we should not forget that the key to success in Kaliningrad will be strong economic development in the oblast, supported by the EU in a harmonious manner with the Russian programmes for this territory."
"Improved economic growth in Kaliningrad to reduce the gap with its immediate EU neighbours would help eliminate the long queues at the border."
"At the same time, EU investments in border crossing infrastructure will continue."
"That is how we are engaging with this very important issue."
"As demonstrated by the very important opening of the St Petersburg south-west waste water treatment plant last year, with its tangible beneficial effects in water quality in the Gulf of Finland, cooperation and cofinancing with the Russian Federation is possible and it pays dividends both to their citizens and to ours."
"The forthcoming large Northern Dimension environmental partnership projects in the Kaliningrad oblast combine with Tacis projects in the water sector in this same oblast to confirm these premises."
"Furthermore, membership of the Northern Dimension as regards our EEA partners, Norway and Iceland, also provides a northern pan-European character to this policy, which we should welcome."
"Finally, I would like to add to what Diana Wallis said."
"Canadian and US involvement also gives the Northern Dimension a transatlantic and circumpolar value that we should maintain."
"Let me also comment on the budget."
"In the Commission's view, the proposal in the report to set up a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea Strategy actually entails some risks."
"It would go against the logic of simplifying the EU's external financial instruments."
"The European neighbourhood and partnership instrument would be the natural tool with which to accompany implementation of the Northern Dimension policy, but other financial instruments will also have a contribution to make."
"We cannot afford to neglect any of the Northern Dimension components and we should use all its potential and synergies in full."
"The European neighbourhood and partnership instrument will provide new opportunities, particularly in the field of cross-border cooperation which, together with a larger contribution from a more prosperous Russia, and a notably larger availability of European Investment Bank funding for this area, will provide the right incentives and improve the well-being of the citizens of the whole of Northern Europe."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Beazley and all the speakers."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(ET) Ten years without review and re-assessment is too long, even for a long-term strategy."
"The Northern Dimension initiative obtained its impetus and direction during Finland's last presidency."
"Now Finland once again holds the EU presidency."
"In the intervening time, the Baltic Sea region has changed beyond recognition."
"Russia is now wealthy enough to buy up energy infrastructure throughout Europe."
"The Kremlin is once again self-confident, even aggressive."
"The Baltic States are now Member States of the European Union, and the Baltic Sea is our internal sea."
"The Baltic Sea region is now the most competitive region in the world, mainly due to the success of the Scandinavian countries."
"In order to maintain its position, it is of the utmost importance that the region also function as a whole in its expanded form."
"The report by our colleague Alexander Stubb emphasises the need for a definite strategy for the Baltic Sea."
"The implementation of the strategy presupposes financing, and thus a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea strategy is unavoidable."
"Without a budget line, the entire strategy would be no more than empty words."
"The financial side of the Northern Dimension consisted only in providing aid to Russia."
"European Union funds were able to significantly reduce the danger of nuclear and conventional pollution from Russia."
"Now it is time to move ahead, concentrating on harmonising the level of development of the Baltic States and the Scandinavian countries."
"Internal security, the safeguarding of nature, transport and infrastructure must be brought up to the Scandinavian level."
"The relatively small markets of the Member States must be integrated."
"There is much work to be done, and the sooner we begin, the better results we will be able to achieve."
"The implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"The Commission welcomes this comprehensive report, which demonstrates the importance attached by the European Parliament to the European Security Strategy and more generally to the field of security."
"As you know, this is not an area where the Commission leads, but we make an important contribution to security in situations of crisis."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we need to act on the basis of a comprehensive concept of security in today's security environment and that both external and internal security aspects need to be adequately addressed."
"We need to use all available instruments, be they civilian or military, be they in the hands of Member States or the Union, to achieve our goals in the security sphere."
"And, as stated in the Commission's communication of last June entitled 'Europe in the World', we need to enhance coherence, effectiveness and visibility through a pragmatic and cooperative approach."
"Let me assure you that the Commission will continue to cooperate with the Council in full respect of our respective institutional responsibilities."
"I am encouraged by recent efforts in the EU amongst Member States, the Commission and the Council Secretariat to work more closely together on achieving the goals of the European Security Strategy."
"Let me mention some examples: the development of the concepts of security sector reform and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, as well as concrete actions in Afghanistan and in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the border assistance mission at Rafah and in Moldova, and the planned mission to Kosovo."
"The new instruments introduced within the context of the 2007-2013 financial perspectives will facilitate better coordination."
"The Stability Instrument, in particular, with its short- and long-term orientation, will help us respond flexibly to upcoming challenges, while going some way towards meeting your demands for better parliamentary oversight in the security field."
"The Commission has been actively developing policies to confront main security threats and to promote effective multilateralism."
"Commission work has focused on, amongst other issues, the Neighbourhood Policy, the effectiveness of development assistance, humanitarian aid and civil protection."
"Drawing lessons from the experience gathered so far, we will soon make proposals for a reinforced ENP."
"The report also refers to various initiatives taken by the Commission in the fields of disaster and crisis response, including health emergencies."
"The report welcomes the Commission's work on creating a European defence equipment market and specifically the forthcoming initiatives on defence procurement and intra-community transfers."
"We are grateful for the Parliament's continued support in this delicate area."
"Progress here will help to strengthen the competitiveness of European industry and the development of military and civilian capabilities for EU policies."
"The Commission is particularly grateful to the Parliament for the support concerning security research and space policy, which are already specific thematic priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"We fully agree on the importance of research for competitiveness."
"In these areas, the Commission is working closely with the European Defence Agency with a view to ensuring complementarity and synergies for the development of capabilities and the strengthening of the European industrial base."
"The Commission and the European Defence Agency together have a key role to play in moving from a national to a European approach and in convergence between security and defence industries."
"We will do this within the limits imposed by the current institutional framework and clearly stated political positions concerning research for civilian and defence purposes by fully respecting the civilian character of the European Security Research Programme."
"In conclusion, I would like to stress that the reports by Parliament are most welcome, as are the joint meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the corresponding committees of the national parliaments and the public hearings."
"Regular stocktaking can be helpful in guiding our efforts to adjust our strategies to a changing environment."
"The Commission is pleased to contribute to these debates by giving full information on its activities as part of the overall EU effort."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to say how much I appreciate the Vice-President's presence here today, which demonstrates the importance that the Commission attaches to security and defence policy, while the Council's absence from a debate on it can - if one puts a favourable gloss on it - be interpreted to mean that the Finnish Presidency is, now that the pillar structure has been put in abeyance, on the way to accepting that security and defence policy, too, has become a matter for the Community."
"Were it not for the fact that I subscribe to this favourable interpretation, I would be very angry at their absence."
"This foreign, security and defence policy is becoming increasingly important, and I would like to thank Mr von Wogau for this report and also the Security and Defence Sub-Committee for the work that it has done, which highlights the truly decisive field into which developments are leading us."
"When one considers the effort we put into securing our energy supplies, or the situation around Iran, the changes that may well occur in American policy in Iraq and Afghanistan following their elections, or the debate we had this afternoon on Gaza; not to mention the things that are going on in Darfur and in other regions, where some are buying raw materials while others campaign for human rights and then hold great summits in Beijing and Shanghai, it is not difficult to realise that this issue is going to be of increasing importance to Europe, and that is why it is necessary that some efforts be made."
"It is only if we Europeans become more credible in terms of our military capacity that we will be able to get the trans-Atlantic alliance to seek to rely not merely on military might, but on the threefold chord of prevention - which takes precedence - combined with civilian crisis management and military capacity."
"We will be able to achieve that only through our strong position within what is termed the West, and that is why we must also make it our concern to strengthen our links with NATO."
"I would be glad if, instead of a multiplicity of individual operations with national headquarters, there were to be political agreement that these would run more on the basis of 'Berlin plus', for that would mean not only a more Community-based approach, but also, at the same time, more common purpose and cooperation with NATO."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, let me say something quite brief about the view our Socialist Group in this House takes of what has emerged from the committee."
"There are three things that we regard as important."
"First of all, there is the need to reinforce the diplomatic and civil elements of the security strategy."
"Secondly, there is the need to avoid the traps that might leave us with an unfounded military doctrine; the text contains no terms such as 'pre-emptive' or anything of the sort."
"Thirdly, the instruments and the institutional requirements must be kept absolutely separate."
"We regard these as important advances, and it proved possible to make progress on these points by means of good cooperation with the rapporteur, for which I am grateful."
"From a social democrat point of view, however, there still remain a few controversial items outstanding."
"We can see the risk of the procurement wish lists getting longer and longer as Christmas draws nearer; we ought to be concentrating on the priorities we have already set ourselves, such as air transport, information and communication."
"We do not actually need to aspire to amphibious motor vehicles, a Mediterranean fleet, and aircraft carriers, which hinders us from going after the things that really are important priorities in terms of the strategy."
"The question must also be asked as to whether the last-named examples belong in some quite different context rather than in the security strategy."
"On the other hand - although we will be endorsing most of the amendments that add precision to the parts of the text that have to do with diplomacy, civil society and disarmament - we do not believe that crisis prevention must, under all conceivable circumstances, involve the use of exclusively non-military means."
"The reality we face today has already changed, and the rapporteur made reference to that."
"We have sent troops to Macedonia in order to prevent the outbreak there of a civil war similar to those that have broken out in other states belonging to the former Yugoslavia."
"In the Congo, we used not only civilian means, but also sent a contingent of troops, in order to ensure that the elections there could be held in peace, and I am confident that this contingent will be able to return home at the end of this month."
"As I conclude this intervention, I should like to return to the point that the rapporteur made at the very outset and was quite right to highlight, namely that the analysis of the threats and of the action taken under the security strategy need to be reviewed on a regular basis."
"Once the report has been adopted, the next thing we should do is to discuss how we, in this House, can organise this process."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly congratulating Mr von Wogau on his excellent report, which offers an accurate and comprehensive survey of the current line of thinking of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence."
"I also want to thank him for the efforts he made to reach the broadest possible agreement with the other political groups."
"While this clearly means that my group will approve the report, I would like to stress two particular points."
"The first point is the need to ensure effective parliamentary control, both at national and EU levels."
"The EU, as has been said, is currently engaged in a growing number of military and civilian operations in various parts of the world."
"I insist on the need for Parliament to be continually updated and to be informed and consulted whenever a new operation is being contemplated."
"Until now, all these operations have gone well, but it is entirely possible that one day a major incident will occur and there will then be widespread clamour for parliamentary oversight."
"Secondly, much greater clarification of the respective roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the High Representative, the Council and the Member States is also needed."
"Who pays what is too often decided on a case-by-case basis, which again makes oversight difficult."
"This is conducive to overlap and waste and, worst of all, also leads to outright competition between, for instance, the Council's special envoys and the Commission's delegations."
"Both the Council and the Commission will of course deny this is the case, but a number of us know better, even if, luckily, such competition is not the general rule."
"Finally, what is needed most of all is political will on the part of Member State governments and that, alas, is an entirely different story."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of good manners in this House that one starts with warm congratulations to the rapporteur, and, while I am happy to do so, I also have to say that I am deeply saddened not to be able, for the first time in two and a half years, to recommend that my group approve a report - unless, that is, our main amendments to it are accepted."
"I want to justify that firstly by reference to the report's content, and secondly on grounds of form."
"What is fundamental is that a great deal of the report - as one Member has pointed out - reads like the armaments industry's shopping list, but such a thing cannot be sustained under the title of 'European Security Strategy and ESDP', which refers to far more complex concepts."
"That being so, the report is not a comprehensive concept, but rather the very opposite of one."
"I take it that that was the reason why the rapporteur's own group tabled 45 amendments, which is a considerable figure."
"When one looks at the report in detail, it is clear that what it is attempting to do is to blur the boundaries laid down by treaty between internal and external security."
"Europol is covered by the ESDP."
"The intention is that the ESDP should be used for the purpose of combating terrorism, and for the protection of infrastructure, the energy supply, and of the external borders."
"Combining police, military and judicial functions in this way is a blatant violation of treaties currently in force, and it also gives rise to additional security problems; it is the very approach taken by President Bush, Dick Cheney and the now-departed Rumsfeld."
"Homeland security modelled on US security policy has already failed and there is no need for us to copy it."
"Secondly, the report gives the impression that there is no such thing as the civil arm of the European Security and Defence Policy, even though most of the 17 ESDP missions are civilian in nature."
"Nor is sufficient reference made to civil conflict prevention, yet that is precisely what is needed right now."
"Thirdly, instead of going into detail about the defence market, it would have been timely to speak plainly about Europe's security and about disarmament - both conventional and nuclear - yet the subject occurs nowhere in the report."
"Fourthly, I would like to look at the question of what military goods are to be purchased: aircraft carriers, satellite communication systems - all these things are asked for, with the justification given being that we are becoming a defence union."
"What sign is there here, I ask you, of a realistic assessment of what we now have to do?"
"We have to work towards harmonisation; we have to compel the nation states, in the interests of all, to harmonise their strategies, structures and equipment, but the idea of us being a defence union is somewhere over the rainbow."
"It always used to be the Greens who were fundamentalists, and it is quite astonishing that you have now gone that way."
"As I see it, the resolutions adopted at Cologne, Helsinki and Feira have been turned on their heads, and, if I were a schoolteacher, I would give you nought out of ten for missing the point."
"I regret to have to say it, but this amounts to an attempt at remilitarising European foreign policy."
"In committee, we had negotiated a consensus, and it was the rapporteur himself who broke it at the last minute."
"That is an unfair way of going about things, and something we cannot accept."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Greens appear to be learning."
"The chairman of the security and defence sub-committee has produced a report on military policy in the EU."
"The report has now been wrapped up in social democratic cotton wool, its language - originally unmistakeable - robbed of its punch."
"It is evident that no place could be found for the statement in the draft to the effect that the EU ought, under certain conditions, to be open to the concept of pre-emptive warfare; that sort of talk was, no doubt, too plain."
"The report makes the mistakes usually associated with a militarised EU foreign policy."
"It incorporates a risk analysis of the European Security Strategy, according to which the principal threats faced by the European Union and its citizens are international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failed states and organised crime."
"What about poverty, hunger and social inequality?"
"The report speaks up for military border surveillance - aimed against whom, I wonder? - and for the use of military means to secure access to resources."
"The EU wants to develop a strategic partnership with NATO; the report 'welcomes NATO's increasing capability of playing a role in out-of-theatre operations' - and that in a report from the European Parliament!"
"It also calls for a considerable strengthening of Europe's operational capacities, including air and sea transport, and the conflation of civilian and military is taken still further."
"The report amounts to a catalogue of demands aimed at the further militarisation of the European Union - demanding, among other things, more money for crisis operations, which will have to be found from the Community budget, which means new financial arrangements."
"After the games played on us with Athena, what is now being proposed is the introduction of a virtual military budget."
"We all know that the Treaty of Nice, quite rightly, outlaws any freestanding military budget for the EU; that is why attempts are being made to resurrect the deceased EU constitutional treaty, for as it says, 'stresses the importance of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which will bring about major progress towards a Security and Defence Union'."
"It is for precisely that reason that we are opposed to this Constitutional Treaty for the EU."
"What is being called for here is the EU as a military union."
"There are those for whom making the EU a military union is a goal, and paragraphs 51 and 52 of this report read like their wish list, with new weaponry and more money to buy it and enable the EU to be a military global player around the world."
"That is the wrong way to go about things."
"The EU is currently involved in at least 11 military and police operations around the world, and more are in the pipeline; the list now includes Afghanistan, where NATO troops are killing more and more civilians, and now the EU wants to join in the carnage as soon as possible, when what is needed - and now! - is for the troops to be brought home from Afghanistan and elsewhere."
"The European Union has no need of more armaments; it needs to be a civil power."
"What is needed is disarmament, and it is needed right now."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, in the early 1950s Jean Monnet proposed a European Defence Community, with a European army run by a European Minister for Defence, a common budget and common arms procurement."
"This project was thankfully rejected by the French after President de Gaulle opposed the idea."
"Undeterred, Jean Monnet and his acolytes pursued the idea of a European political union by economic means rather than by defence and military means."
"Over 50 years later, we have a European Union which has almost completed its political agenda: it has its own President, its own cabinet in the shape of the Commission, its own Parliament, a single currency, flag, anthem and Court of Justice, just to name a few of its attributes."
"However, if it is to be a real state it must have its own military forces, and that is what this report is about."
"The report calls for a common equipment and equipment procurement policy and for integrated command and control and communication systems."
"What better way to ensure the integration of Europe's national military forces than by ensuring that they will begin so interdependently that they will not be able to operate independently."
"The militaristic pill is sugared, however, by reference to humanitarian operations and crisis management."
"However, call it what you will, it is an army, and if war is the continuation of politics by other means, then the European Union needs an army to pursue its foreign policy ambitions."
"I am not surprised that Mr von Wogau pursues political integration by these means."
"He believes in political integration and is open about it, and I respect him for that."
"What disgusts me is that Britain's Prime Minister, the liar Mr Blair, and his rotten and corrupt Labour Government collude with the process of integrating Britain's armed forces into the planned European army, while pretending to defend Britain's national interest."
"Luckily, you are over call-up age, Mr Batten, so it will never affect you."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.20 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Membership of political groups: see Minutes"
"The implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mr von Wogau on the implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for presenting a comprehensive analysis of the current problems of the European Security Strategy and for evaluating threats to the modern world."
"One example of these threats: in paragraph 10 the report stresses a need for a major EU contribution to promote regional disarmament."
"I would like to draw attention to the Kaliningrad area, a heavily militarised Russian enclave within the EU."
"To continue pretending that this last vestige of the Cold War and Soviet expansion is something with which we have to accommodate would be dangerous and absurd."
"Therefore the demilitarisation of this area, which should be followed by making Kaliningrad a pilot project and opening it up to free trade, should be one of the topics to be raised at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit."
"The von Wogau report clearly presents our final objective."
"We are on our way to a Security and Defence Union."
"However, it also reminds us that the EU is still a long way from this goal."
"We are just noting progress, increasing capacities and looking for additional money."
"There are some problems we need to be very clear about."
"We need to establish a common market in the field of defence, to provide for a European budget to cover both the military and the civil aspects of security and to intensify cooperation between the EU Defence Ministers, with the final goal of creating the post of Deputy EU Foreign Minister in charge of the ESDP."
"To that end, it is essential to avoid duplication of efforts and to coordinate all these activities with NATO."
"There is an urgent need to provide the same access to space-based intelligence systems for all Member States on a common basis."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is often said in Europe that there is a crisis of public confidence in the European project and in European politics."
"There is no such scepticism when it comes to security and defence policy."
"As public opinion polls have shown, more than two thirds of the Europeans support this policy and take the view that the risks and dangers associated with terrorism, organised crime, regional conflicts and the spread of weapons of mass destruction require a joint, Europe-wide solution."
"Mr von Wogau's report calls for a joint solution, and for elements of the European security and defence policy to be strengthened."
"I wholeheartedly support this call and the efforts to establish EU security and defence."
"The proposals for creating an internal market for developing, manufacturing and purchasing arms, a shared communication and media system and European civil defence mechanisms are among many that I consider to be steps in the right direction."
"Europe needs a joint approach to the security risks and threats it faces and Mr von Wogau's report outlines such an approach in a way that is both realistic and outstanding."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European security and defence policy has great challenges ahead of it, and the EU must not close its eyes to them."
"What is certain is that the future will see the EU taking on more and more international commitments, and the disturbing developments in the Middle East, in North Korea and in Iran are harbingers of this trend."
"What we need is effective decision-making machinery, a clear command structure, no doubt about who is empowered to do what, competent personnel capable of being deployed quickly and kitted out with modern equipment, and the logistical capacity for getting troops quickly to where they are going to serve."
"The von Wogau report demands these things, and also contains proposals for their improvement; it is for these reasons that we will be supporting it."
"Over recent years, the ESDP has achieved some progress; the battle groups will, with effect from 1 January 2007, have become fully operational, and the Foreign Relations Council, meeting yesterday, noted that there had been further improvements in the quality of equipment used by the Member States' armies."
"The European Defence Agency makes a valuable contribution towards the harmonisation of the armaments market and the coordination of joint research projects in the security and defence sphere."
"It has to be said, though, that the planning of EU mission off-budget is on the increase, and this is still a disturbing trend."
"An increase in the number of missions presupposes that they are legitimate in democratic terms, but that cannot be guaranteed if their finances are planned without reference to the European Parliament, which results in an unjustifiable lack of transparency."
"The report contains refreshingly clear proposals as to how this may be prevented, and these, too, we can fully support."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"(ES) Madam President, the drawing up of the European Security Strategy was influenced by three great debates of an international nature: the debate on the new threats that had to be faced and on how to face them, particularly following 11 September; that on the problems faced by the United Nations as a universal and multilateral forum for preventing and managing disputes; and that on the commitments to be made by the European Union in order to become a more active, capable and coherent actor at world level."
"The European Security Strategy therefore points out that the greatest challenges that the European Union and its citizens must face today are international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failed States and organised crime."
"I naturally agree that those problems are important."
"I fear, however, that this list does not place sufficient emphasis on other aspects that I believe are just as important, if not more so."
"I am talking, for example, about poverty, the lack of a global justice system, the collective criminalisation of groups and communities, the increasing militarisation of the planet, the plundering of the basic subsistence resources of the poorest countries by the rich countries, the pollution of the environment and the destruction of social ecosystems."
"In this regard, I do not believe that the European Union always offers the most appropriate response, in either political or structural terms."
"Hence, for some time we have been hearing arguments in favour of creating a single European army, for example."
"Nevertheless, that army is usually seen as an addition, or, if you like, a complement, to the 25 existing armies, and not as a replacement for them, as I believe it should be."
"Though we apparently agree that, in order to deal with the current challenges, numerous armies of a national nature are no longer necessary, we still have a European Union with 25 national armies, whose personnel amount to some two million people, whose main duty is to defend the Member States' borders and interests and which jointly cost more than EUR 160 million per year."
"Furthermore, these are figures that many of us would like to see dedicated to the prevention and management of conflicts."
"In short, the actions and decisions of the governments do not currently appear to be consistent with the change of attitude towards security that we have been seeing recently, particularly at European level."
"(EL) Madam President, the report describes in the clearest and most revelatory manner the nature of the European Union as an imperialist union of European monopolies which is being militarised."
"The so-called 'European security strategy' has nothing to do with a security strategy for the people; it is an undisguised aggressive imperialist policy which moves in two directions."
"Firstly, towards going along fully with the USA and ΝΑΤΟ in criminal action against the peoples and, secondly, towards the construction of the European Union's own mechanisms to strengthen its military power, so that it is also in a position to take military action and intervene on its own."
"Its objective is to secure a better share when the markets are divided up."
"This policy is based on the principle of preventive war, on the adoption, to all intents and purposes, of the new NATO military doctrine for imperialist interventions throughout the world, on the pretext of combating global threats, terrorism and interruptions to the flow of natural resources, the imposition of democracy, crisis management and the principle of preventive strike."
"It announces that the imperialist interventions of the European Union no longer have any limits to their action."
"Their scope is extending to the entire world."
"It indirectly adopts the model of the imperialist interventions in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, in other words imperialist war on various pretexts, such as the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that were never found, followed by occupation and reconstruction."
"This enriches the imperialists by plundering the wealth of the peoples."
"It also promotes the creation of rapid intervention forces and deliberately links military and civil missions, baptising military interventions 'humanitarian'."
"It even links the external security of the European Union with the creation of a European constabulary and policy force, with the militarisation of the borders and a military approach to immigrants and refugees."
"It even increases funding for military purposes with hidden budgets."
"For the workers, however, there are starvation wages and permanent austerity."
"In promoting this strategy, the aggressiveness of the European Union is intensifying and escalating, both towards third countries and within it."
"The enemy is the people."
"Efforts to strengthen the military power of the European Union are linked to the efforts to strengthen it in the imperialist competition and within the frameworks of competition between the war industries."
"The effort to show that, apparently, the European Union is distancing itself from the US imperialist policy in Iran is brazen deceit of the peoples."
"The excitement about Guantanamo and CIA flights and abductions on European territory is hypocritical, given that it follows the same imperialist policy and, at the same time, strengthens operational cooperation with ΝΑΤΟ."
"The peoples must be concerned about and must act against the arming, militarisation and terrorism of the imperialists."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate you on the report on European security policy."
"It is an excellent report which, in my opinion, requires no further amendments."
"In particular, it does not require any amendments which would deprive the European Union of any military significance in the world."
"If it wants to play a greater role in the world, the European Union must be able to have an effective military presence, not only on its own borders, but also in other parts of the world."
"This will not be achieved by simply creating a defence agency and harmonising armaments."
"We also need to convince European public opinion to support greater defence spending that would be in line with our ambitions."
"Europe has proved that it does not abuse military power, so pacifist fears in this respect are unfounded."
"In fact, we should instead fear for our political and military ability to take responsibility for global security."
"The creation of a European security policy should not aim to copy NATO, our main, tried and tested defence policy instrument."
"Neither should our strategic autonomy upset our political and technical cooperation with the NATO powers."
"In fact, the Western world, which stretches far beyond the borders of the European Union, has a right to expect from us a real contribution towards cooperation and synergy in terms of our joint activities."
"The report presented this in a well-balanced manner, and that is why we will gladly support it in tomorrow's vote."
"(PL) Madam President, today's debate on the implementation of a European Security Strategy is one of the more important debates concerning the future of the European Union."
"It is a step towards adopting some of the solutions contained in the dead constitutional treaty."
"The proposal to create the post of a European Foreign and Defence Minister is a threat to the interests of many Member States."
"Germany's agreement with Russia was a fine example of European solidarity in the field of energy."
"It is very typical and should be viewed as a warning sign."
"It makes sense that the Union needs an instrument to exert military influence on its immediate surroundings."
"However, any attempt to take on military responsibility for global security would represent an attempt to replace NATO or, to be more precise, to weaken the United States' influence in Europe and the world."
"There should be no competition between NATO and the European Union in the field of security and defence policy."
"It must be stressed that NATO has a significantly more important role and capabilities than the armed forces allocated to the European Union."
"Of course, there are members of the EU who are not NATO members, and we have to find a way to involve them in matters relating to European security."
"This kind of cooperation should take place within the framework of cooperation between the national armed forces of the Member States."
"We do not need to create new command headquarters, but simply to allocate parts of national armed forces to cooperate in specific actions."
"However, it is vital to create a coherent European system in the field of intelligence, crisis response and the monitoring of economic threats."
"It is for the national governments and the Union to monitor how individual Member States are prepared for terrorist attacks or whether they have an appropriate territorial defence system."
"Moreover, the Union should deal with security in its immediate surroundings and not try to exert a global influence and become involved in local conflicts around the world."
"Madam President, I have consistently opposed EU meddling in the defence sphere."
"European countries are responsible for their security through their own efforts individually and through NATO collectively, and that is how it should remain."
"The European Union has moved on to defence territory, not because it adds defence capabilities, because it does not, but because there are those who wish to see the EU acquire more State-like attributes and become a global actor, pursuing its own distinct foreign policy objectives."
"To do this, it wants the full range of foreign policy instruments at its disposal, including armed forces."
"This report, however, goes well beyond the immediate ambitions of even those who drive ESDP at the moment."
"It advocates a Security and Defence Union and wants the EU to have its own defence budget."
"Heaven help us if those responsible for the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and all the interfering and counterproductive over-regulation of our lives were to have a role in organising our defence."
"These unacceptable proposals for a Security and Defence Union, for an EU defence budget, are enough in themselves to ensure the opposition of the British Conservative delegation, but the international context in which this report is being debated makes it doubly objectionable."
"NATO is currently engaged in a vital operation in Afghanistan."
"It is no exaggeration to say that the success of this mission is indispensable to NATO's future and to our own long-term security."
"The Alliance has repeatedly called for reinforcement of this Afghanistan mission with combat troops, tactical lift helicopters and indeed with forward civil reconstruction efforts to consolidate the military gains that are made."
"With some honourable exceptions, the response from European allies has been pitiful."
"I have no doubt in my own mind that ESDP is a distraction from NATO and is part of the problem."
"At this time of threat to the democracies, when solidarity is needed, it is disastrous for Europeans and Americans to have competing strategic visions, or indeed to have two defence organisations with overlapping membership, making competing claims on the same limited resources."
"(PT) I wish to congratulate Mr von Wogau on his ambitious report."
"It is a report that recognises that, in spite of the progress that has been made in the area of Europe's security and defence, much remains to be done."
"I agree with what Mr von Wogau said in the Chamber today: the process of building a Union of security and defence has the potential to bring us closer again to the citizens of the Union."
"The figures from Eurobarometer are clear: 77% of Europeans support a European security and defence policy."
"Even in the United Kingdom, the country of Mr van Orden and of some of the most vocal Eurosceptics in this Chamber, support stands at 59%."
"Yet this report is limited in scope."
"Although it boldly proposes the creation of a European budget for the Union's military activities, advocates strengthening the role of the European Parliament and national parliaments in scrutinising Europe's security and defence policies and rightly calls for the advances proposed by the Constitutional Treaty not to be cast aside, this report limits itself to reiterating support for the initiatives put forward by the Council and the Commission in vital areas of industrial integration and the creation of a European defence equipment market."
"It is disappointing that this report does not go further. I am firmly in favour of introducing the principle of European preference in the area of the procurement of defence equipment."
"What is at stake in the long term is the EU's strategic autonomy, and Parliament has thus far been unable to present its own vision in this area."
"Madam President we must not let ourselves be blinded by the dogma of the market."
"It is crucial that, following the lead of our friends and partners around the world, we do not forget the strategic and political implications of this sector of industry."
"Madam President, this is the first serious review of the European Security Strategy by Parliament, but we are much less clear about NATO."
"We say that NATO is responsible for our collective defence and a forum for transatlantic relations."
"We do not say what we would do if NATO fails to achieve peace in Afghanistan."
"NATO is not supposed to be defeated."
"NATO has suffered from an absence of clear strategic reappraisal since the end of the Cold War and it suffers from continuing poor collaboration with the European Union."
"Parliament should not be so shy of a critical scrutiny of NATO, without which our grip upon the development of the European Security and Defence Policy will always remain fanciful."
"(SV) Madam President, during my two years here in Parliament, I have come across many reports dealing with everything under the sun."
"However, the report we are now debating is the worst I have seen so far."
"Mr von Wogau proposes now one thing and now another, but the main theme is that of militarising the EU by developing the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"He wants to extend the scope of the European Security Strategy."
"This would open the way for pre-emptive wars of the type we are seeing right now in, for example, the Middle East."
"Mr von Wogau also believes that military efforts in the field of crisis management should be funded out of the EU budget."
"In other words, it would be taxpayers in, for example, neutral Sweden who would pay for military operations around the world."
"Among the more fanciful proposals is that of setting up a standing naval force in the Mediterranean Sea to take care of the EU's security interests in the region."
"To top it all, the rapporteur also emphasises the need for a Constitution, because this would speed up the creation of a Defence Union."
"When, in 1995, Sweden joined the EU, many Swedes were sceptical."
"That the EU might become militarised was precisely one of the concerns dismissed by EU groupies as being completely unwarranted."
"Today, slightly more than ten years later, we see that this is by no means an impossibility."
"On the contrary. I, for one, do not want to see my three sons and other young Europeans participate in an EU army, and I therefore call on my fellow Members to vote against this report in tomorrow's vote."
"(PL) Madam President, Mr Solana's 2003 strategy is an excellent document."
"It accurately describes the threats and challenges we face, as well as clearly describing the specifically European response which has become the calling card for a European security and defence policy."
"In this respect, it does not seem necessary to update this document."
"After all, NATO has been using the same strategic concept since April 1999."
"This is the only point on which I disagree with Mr Karl von Wogau's proposal."
"The value of this report lies elsewhere, in the prospects it outlines for the ESDP."
"It is the result of a frank appraisal of the current civilian and military capabilities of the European Union, and Karl von Wogau states that 'The European Union currently has at its disposal only a limited capability for implementing civilian and military operations'."
"Karl von Wogau also draws the right conclusions from this assessment."
"First of all, he calls for intensive cooperation between the European Union and NATO."
"Secondly, he calls for the Union to focus its capabilities on our immediate geographic surroundings."
"The rapporteur is aware of the cause of these limited capabilities, since he mentions the lack of strategic air and sea transport, interoperational telecommunications systems and intelligence capabilities, especially in relation to satellites."
"These comments are by no means new, as these deficiencies have been with us since at least the first Capabilities Commitment Conference in 2002."
"In my view, however, the report's biggest asset is to be found in the long-term perspective that Karl von Wogau outlines for the ESDP."
"He moves beyond the boundaries of operational targets, in other words beyond 2010 and beyond the terms of the Constitutional Treaty."
"This outlook involves the creation of a security and defence union."
"We must not lose sight of this objective."
"It is, and should be, the guiding light for the next steps that need to be taken to develop the ESDP."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by quoting the results of the Eurobarometer survey, according to which 70% of European citizens are in favour of a European Security and Defence Policy."
"The citizens of the European Union seem to have a better idea of the challenges of our time than the Council representatives, who are not present in the plenary Chamber in Strasbourg tonight."
"The European Security Strategy should focus on the most important aims in terms of creating a common Security and Defence Policy for the European Union."
"Above all, we should call for a new generation of satellite systems to be integrated into the European system and for the data gathered to be made available to the military and the police, as well as for the purposes of disaster management, using the satellite centre in Torrejón."
"Intelligence remains one of the most important areas of this strategy."
"Secondly, the rapid response groups being set up now must be provided with intelligence and communications equipment that is the same as, or at least compatible with that used by NATO."
"Madam President, I congratulate Commissioner Frattini for staying on board for so long."
"Perhaps he is excited about the next season at Ferrari, with Kimi Raikkonen driving for them."
"Sorry, Mr Duff, I know you do not follow Formula One!"
"I should like to make five points."
"First point: I support the report."
"I think it is excellent."
"There is only one thing I think goes a little over the top and that is the idea of a European Defence Minister to supplement our Foreign Minister."
"We will wait for the Constitution to start with one and then perhaps have the other."
"Second point: this concerns Mr Van Orden, who unfortunately has already left."
"He raised a lot of problems about the relationship between NATO and the EU."
"I always tell Mr Van Orden that he should get a life."
"If we have the Constitution all those problems will be solved, but alas, he is probably not in favour of the Constitution."
"Third point: I think the strategic interests of the EU and the US are exactly the same and this report shows that very well."
"That is why I think we need to try to solve our problems hand in hand as Mr von Wogau suggests."
"Fourth point: I think the biggest structural problem that we have between ESDP and NATO is that our cooperation does not really work in the way it is supposed to."
"As a former civil servant, I think that the relationships are too much staff-to-staff, in other words too many civil servants dealing with civil servants."
"Perhaps we should make the relationship political and thus get a result."
"My final point is that I think the strength of the ESDP is its diversity."
"If we only focus on the civilian aspects of crisis management, we are cheating ourselves."
"The question is, do you accept ethnic cleansing, for instance?"
"If your answer is no, we also need a military aspect of crisis management."
"So therefore I support the report with all my heart."
"I think it is excellent."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr von Wogau for this report, which is comprehensive, pragmatic and also courageous."
"I share the view - one held by 70% of Europe's population and most of the people in this House - that the only response to the major threats facing us, from terrorism to failed states, that ultimately promises any success is that of a European Security Strategy."
"I also share the rapporteur's view that such a strategy must be constantly adapted if Europe wants to remain in future an area of security, freedom and prosperity."
"Since there is hardly likely to be, in future, much support for increased military expenditure, we need to make more efficient use than hitherto of the means and resources at our disposal, and that is why the European Security and Defence Policy needs common standards, shared research and development and a single system of procurement."
"There is a need for a single system of air and space reconnaissance and shared telecommunication standards."
"There is a need for strategic cooperation between the forces deployed in the fields of external and internal security."
"What is evident from present-day deployments of troops in the Congo is that, although their dedication has yielded successes, there are just as many deficits to be dealt with."
"We all know that the EU, although an economic giant, continues to be a dwarf in security policy terms, but if it wants to become a political union, it must stop being a security dwarf and abandon national animosities in favour of something holistic and bigger."
"It is for that reason that the Community needs a security policy that is also to be funded by the Community, with Parliament sharing in the decision-making and monitoring it, and with a political head in the person of a deputy foreign minister."
"It is to this road that this report points, and that is why it is not only courageous, but also forward-looking in the interests of a secure Europe for its citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I welcome the report which correctly reflects our opinions on the evolution of ESDP in the future."
"ESDP should further enhance its civil-military character; the best combinations of all assets and instruments are able to offer us the optimal stabilisation result in the field."
"The aim is to stabilise a crisis management area with a better perspective in the long run."
"In this way, we should not be inspired by the military model of NATO, but be able to develop our own approach as is the case in Congo."
"Belligerents trust us more since EU is not driven by a leader nation with political arrière-pensées and its decisions are taken through transparency rules."
"Rapid reaction in movement and transport is a common challenge for all EU operations regardless of their nature. Europe should better explore the use of and synergies among its civilian transport assets."
"Europeans are leaders in civilian air and maritime transport and such advantage should also serve our rapid reaction in crisis periods."
"Multi-modal planning, optimal combination of different type of assets (air, sea, helicopters, rail) and better use of civilian assets need to be integrated into our concepts of how we conduct operations."
"(PL) Madam President, whether the aims presented in the Security Strategy are achieved largely depends on the ability of the European Union to implement this document, which will, in turn, lend the European Union credibility in terms of a serious security policy, and make it a body capable of taking decisive action in crisis situations."
"At the moment, we are facing many challenges in the field of foreign policy, such as the conflicts in the Middle East, military missions involving soldiers of the Member States and the emergence of new world powers such as China or India."
"In these times, it is vital to strengthen our Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"To make our Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective and efficient, we need to take key steps today and provide answers to the fundamental questions posed by the rejected Constitutional Treaty."
"We also need people and institutions to conduct this policy."
"This includes creating the post of an EU Foreign Minister, greater financial resources, better analysis of key problems and coordination of the policies of the Member States."
"It is important to create our own pool of skills in the field of humanitarian operations, peacekeeping and pacification missions and crisis management."
"The security of the Member States of the European Union can be assured by having an effective, multi-faceted system and a stable region."
"Implementing the Strategy will largely depend on the will of the Member States and the diligent fulfilment of the responsibilities assigned to them."
"Actions such as the adoption of a legal framework, an implementation timescale and commitments in the field of external relations will, in themselves, not be enough to create an effective system for preventing and combating threats."
"Succession and wills (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on succession and wills (2005/2148 (INI))."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say straight away that, in relation to the measure before us, there are in the European Union between 50 000 and 100 000 cases of succession due to death, and this is a measure that is likely to become the reference in issues of international law."
"Transnational succession is an extremely wide-ranging phenomenon, and it comes up against an increasing number of difficulties stemming from profound differences between the system of private international law and the substantive law systems of the Member States."
"That often results in obstacles to the freedom of movement and the enjoyment of the right to own property."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, has therefore decided to take the initiative to make successions in Europe simpler by using the power granted to it by Article 192 of the EC Treaty, and to call on the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal."
"Since we, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately do not yet have the power to initiate legislation like all our counterparts in the national parliaments - that is an observation that I always make - I turn to you, Commissioner Frattini, and, with the strong backing that I am sure the qualified majority vote will give me, I call on you to carry forward an important request of ours in the interests of Europe's citizens."
"You are aware that, for beneficiaries to take possession of an estate, they currently have to start proceedings in all the countries where the property is located."
"This is not only a costly and laborious process, but, since the transmission of property by inheritance is a special way of transferring ownership, it is associated with emotional and personal aspects - highly complex interpersonal relationships that even transcend legal arguments."
"I should like to mention a very personal recollection from my youth, when I was at university: Professor Cariota-Ferrara, who had done his thesis on inheritance law, used to say that inheritance law was a law about emotions, a law that often involved suffering."
"Hence, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that our proposal will make a real contribution to creating a Europe of the citizens."
"I am grateful to the committee, which debated this issue at length and thoroughly examined all aspects of it."
"I truly believe that what we are putting before Parliament is a very important proposal that represents a step forwards for both political Europe and the citizens' Europe."
"I therefore call on you to adopt this report, and I also ask Commissioner Frattini to do so on behalf of the citizens of Europe."
"The report we are proposing includes measures aimed at ensuring that there is one applicable law and one competent court."
"Applicable law and competent court should generally coincide, and the criterion for establishing them is also objective: the habitual place of residence of the deceased at the time of death."
"Individual freedom of choice is not ruled out, however: people making a will may choose which law should govern the whole succession, either the law of their own nationality or the law of the country in which they are habitually resident at the time the choice is made."
"Similarly, should disputes arise, the parties may choose the applicable law and the competent courts."
"I should like to say a few words on a key point that I consider the cornerstone of our proposal. The report proposes the introduction of a legally binding European certificate of inheritance, which will set out the law applicable to the succession, the beneficiaries of the estate, the persons responsible for administering the estate and their powers, and the property comprising the estate."
"The certificate will be drawn up according to a standard model and will allow the property inherited to be recorded in the public registers of the Member State in which the property is located."
"Mrs Berger has carried out a more thorough investigation than the others precisely on this proposal and has tabled five amendments. In this respect, I must say that I am particularly concerned that the certificate should be compulsory, consistent and legally certain."
"Indeed, if that is not established, I think the whole structure of the provision will be adversely affected, and it will become less effective and rather less of a reference."
"Not all the countries in the EU may take it into account, and it will end up being a consultative measure rather than a mandatory one."
"In any event, that is likely to diminish its force, which should lie precisely in its legal certainty and its ability to reach all citizens, so that they can have a real chance of receiving their inheritance by means of these instruments."
"In my opinion, the other amendments should be rejected, and in that respect I should like to appeal particularly to Mrs Berger to think again and perhaps to withdraw or recast her amendment in order to make this proposal more incisive."
"Madam President, Mr Gargani, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate Chairman Gargani and the Committee on Legal Affairs for having drawn up a proposal which, if it is approved by this House - as I hope it will be - I will not hesitate to transform into a legislative proposal."
"I too would like to begin with an observation."
"We have worked for a long time to gauge the opinions of legal operators, of experts in the field, and, above all, of the citizens of the European Union, on the possibility of having an instrument clearly identifying the applicable law and therefore making it easier to create a real European area in the sector of succession and wills."
"Well, from the results of a survey conducted by Eurobarometer in July 2006 on the various aspects of family law in Europe, it has emerged that, on average, 80% of Europeans believe that recognition of succession and wills within the whole European area is necessary."
"There are, obviously, countries in which the consensus on this matter is even stronger: in Germany, for example, one of the great founding countries, and in Latvia, a smaller country, 92% consensus was recorded in favour of this kind of legislation; in my own country, Italy, the figure was 88%, as in Hungary."
"There has therefore been a wide response, showing that, on average, four fifths of Europeans are in favour of facilitating European regulation on succession and wills."
"In March 2005, the Commission published a Green Paper on the subject, which has enabled us to gather hundreds of responses of great interest from academics, the legal profession and operators in the field."
"We have also gathered many good ideas from the hearing on transnational successions, which Parliament had the excellent idea of organising."
"Among other things, I can inform you that the Commission has, in turn, organised a public hearing on the same topic, to be held on 30 November."
"It will give us an opportunity to collect further ideas, which, I believe, together with Mr Gargani's report, will enable us to submit a legislative proposal in the near future."
"The last subject on which I would like to comment briefly is that already touched on by Chairman Gargani, namely that of a European Certificate of Inheritance."
"I share the rapporteur's view that, if we want a truly effective European instrument in this area, it must have binding effect within European territory."
"In this regard, many of you will remember other instruments of private international law on which we have reached an agreement."
"If a certain instrument, once adopted in one Member State, could be called into question every time in the other Member States in which it is to be applied - if it is not binding on them, in other words - one of the foundations of the area of free movement of decisions would be jeopardised."
"Obviously, the objection could be made that a certificate of inheritance, as such, is always binding, since otherwise it would not be able to certify situations."
"However, I believe that in this case it would be appropriate to emphasise its binding nature, as we are creating, perhaps for the first time, a useful instrument for resolving the problem of movement among European citizens that is also shown through the recognition of wills, that is the problem of succession and wills."
"Allow me therefore to say in advance that I agree entirely with Mr Gargani."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Mr Gargani has presented us with a report that expresses the Committee on Legal Affairs' desire for the European institutions to take action in the field of succession law."
"Commissioner Frattini has stressed that 80% of European citizens believe that succession law must be regulated and recognised in a harmonised fashion throughout the European Union."
"We are not talking about theories, but about the realities affecting people who live in different countries or who have families in different countries and who, when succession takes place, find themselves in an absolutely desperate situation."
"Unfortunately, the European Union's Treaties do not provide for the possibility of harmonising the substantive law on succession."
"This is something that will probably have to be put right in the future, since it makes very little sense that the consequences, the legal system and the rights of inheritors should change entirely as a result of moving a few kilometres and depending on whether a person is established in one country or another."
"For the time being, the Committee on Legal Affairs, by means of the report by Mr Gargani, is restricting itself to telling the Commission that it is necessary to begin to propose actions of a legislative nature."
"Commissioner Frattini has indicated that the Commission is in favour of doing so."
"We will probably not be able to go much further at the moment."
"We in the Committee on Legal Affairs have discussed the merits and the content of the proposals that Mr Frattini includes in the annex; there are certain amendments tabled by my Socialist colleague, Mrs Berger, which are intended to correct some of the defects noted in that annex, but the most important thing of all is that the Commission is prepared to make practical proposals, as Mr Frattini has indicated in this House."
"We cannot improvise on this issue, since we must work on the basis of our experience."
"Anybody who has had to deal with an international succession issue within the European Union will have found themselves faced with huge difficulties, above all in terms of jurisdiction."
"We should probably begin to deal with the issue from the point of view of jurisdiction, the competences of courts and the recognition and effectiveness of decisions, removing the exequatur procedure, as Mr Gargani recommends, which makes no sense in the European Union."
"I therefore hope that Mr Gargani's efforts and Mr Frattini's contribution will make it possible for us soon to have practical proposals on the table for the development of Community law in this field."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to welcome the Green Paper, and thank Mr Gargani very much for his report and all the work that has been done on it in terms of consultation."
"It really is welcome."
"This is clearly an issue that affects an increasing number of our citizens and that we have to address, but it is not a simple issue."
"When one thinks about how terrible it is for any individual to have to deal with bereavement and then adds to that the difficulties of dealing with some sort of transnational legal situation, it is clearly an area that we have to try to tackle in order to make life easier for our citizens, having encouraged them to be mobile in the way that we have."
"But the legal problems that this raises touch on subsidiarity."
"They touch the culture of our different legal systems very deeply."
"But it is clear that if we are to tackle the problem, we need, as Mr Gargani has said - and I think my group would also underline - to move towards a binding European certificate of inheritance."
"That has to be our first goal, to have free circulation of such a binding certificate, in the same way as we have free circulation of ordinary judgments."
"It is going to be difficult though because, as I have said, it touches matters of public policy within our various countries."
"It touches matters of taxation law."
"But I commend the report and hope that the Commissioner will be able to take it forward to a legislative instrument."
"(DE) Madam President, the rapporteur - and chairman of our committee - deserves thanks for his report and also for having been willing to take on board a number of my amendments following the debates in committee."
"I think today is a good day for a subject that is not exactly fun: death and inheritance."
"Having adopted the services directive at second reading, thank heaven there was no derogation for funeral services, which is what many had wanted."
"Tonight we are discussing European initiatives in the field of inheritance law."
"Right at the outset, I would like to clear up a misunderstanding, since it is evident that a technical error has cropped up."
"I am not seeking to make the certificate of inheritance anything less than binding, but only to delete the words 'unless and until proven otherwise'; on the contrary, indeed, far from wishing to do away with the certificate of inheritance's binding effect, I want to reinforce it."
"Since I shall be clarifying this with the House services, it might perhaps be possible, under these circumstances, for the other groups to vote in favour too."
"I hope that Amendment 3 is now acceptable."
"We are proposing as a starting point a residence period of at least two years, for people should not suffer unexpected legal consequences as a result of short-term relocation, while we do not want to make it easy for someone to evade his own country's inheritance law, to the detriment of his family members, simply by moving elsewhere."
"I would now like to put the case for my other amendments, which provide for the certification of conformity."
"Since Recommendation 1 testifies to our desire not to interfere in Member States' procedural law, I see this examination of conformity as going against the principle of non-interference not only in the Member States' material law, but also in their procedural law."
"I trust that these explanations will help the other groups to support our amendments after all."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Women in international politics (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Gomes, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on Women in international politics."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my gratitude for all the contributions that I received from all political groups in drawing up this report."
"These contributions improved the report substantially."
"The presence of women in international political life has increased."
"Take, for example, Chancellor Merkel, President Bachelet and President Johnson-Sirleaf and Prime-Ministers Han Myeong-Sook of South Korea and Diogo of Mozambique."
"Indeed, the EU Presidency is currently headed by a woman, Mrs Halonen. Yet closer inspection reveals that the female presence in politics remains unsatisfactory, both at world and European level, including within each Member State."
"Gathering data for this report was not easy, and that tells its own bleak story."
"At global level, in spite of the declaration and the platform for action adopted in Beijing, and in spite of the Millennium Development Goals, only ten out of the 191 Member States of the United Nations have a woman as Head of State or Government and only 16% of members of parliament around the world are women."
"In the UN, of the 91 envoys or representatives of the Secretary-General only nine are women."
"In spite of Resolution 1325 of the Security Council, adopted six months ago, the composition of international bodies and missions involved in conflict prevention continues to be characterised by inequality."
"Three weeks ago, the Security Council held a debate on women, peace and security in order to gauge progress in the implementation of Resolution 1325."
"All agreed that there remains much to be done to translate good intentions and positive words into action."
"What emerged from the debate were recommendations to involve more women in peace missions and thereby to improve the operational effectiveness of these missions."
"There was also a call for an urgent change of culture in the office of the Deputy Secretary-General for peace-keeping operations."
"Our report contains similar recommendations."
"I now turn to the situation in Europe."
"Despite Resolution 2025, and others from this Parliament, and despite, too, the Lisbon Strategy, the composition of the European Commission is not yet characterised by gender parity. Furthermore, out of 107 EU third-country delegations, only seven women are currently serving at the level of Head of EC delegation."
"In the Council, there is only one woman among the 14 personal representatives of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"This despite the abundance of qualified, experienced and capable women in the Member States and in the European Institutions."
"At practically all levels of decision-making apart from the top, there are signs that the glass ceiling is starting at least to bulge, if not to break, because it is indeed only at the very top echelons of European power that women remain scandalously under-represented."
"At national level, I wish to highlight the pioneering example of the Zapatero Government in Spain."
"In a world in which the political machinery has a history of blocking women's involvement in political and economic power, this is a model example, which demonstrates that democracy characterised by gender parity is possible and depends a great deal on clear political leadership."
"The conclusions of this report are simple: action must be taken to redress inequality of opportunities at European and national level in all fields: for example, the UN and its Secretary-General, by means of a human resources policy that ought to act as an example to the world, and the EU, by means of support to international women's networks and human resources policies ensuring the balanced presence of men and women in positions of political and economic decision-making."
"In this connection, I welcome the fact that the Council has just sent a questionnaire to the Member States to gauge the level of implementation of Resolution 1325."
"National governments must also encourage more women to apply for political positions at national, European and international level and must ensure that electoral systems produce democratic institutions with balanced representation; no democratic institutions should have fewer than 40% and more than 60% of either sex."
"Quotas and other mechanisms designed to redress the balance, currently necessary for women, may become necessary for men."
"Without parity of representation, democracy is incomplete and does not work properly."
"In this regard, laws and measures contributing towards a better home and working life balance have a vital role to play."
"Lastly, political parties should promote women's involvement by setting quotas and establishing other mechanisms for redressing the balance, including specific training for women to embark on a career in politics."
"The impetus for change also depends on the quality of party political leadership."
"Take my country, Portugal, for example, where women have only been allowed to become, for example, judges, diplomats and armed and security forces professionals since the fall of the dictatorship in 1974. These are careers that could provide many more candidates of both sexes for all kinds of European and international missions and posts."
"Since 1974, there has been extraordinary progress in the presence of women in these careers, yet this progress does not extend to the top of these fields, for example in government or party political decision-making."
"It is abundantly clear that the glass ceiling effect is in operation, in spite of the overwhelming presence of qualified women in universities, public administration and the world of work as a whole."
"A parity law governing the electoral lists of the political parties has recently been adopted and practical results are expected."
"On the path we must follow, numbers should not be our prime concern."
"Rather, we must recognise and highlight the qualitative difference made by the political representation of women in defining government agendas, in conflict resolution, in transparency and in presentation of accounts; in other words, in reinforcing the rule of law and democracy."
"Vice-President of the Commission. Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the honourable rapporteur for this excellent report."
"The Commission works hard to promote gender equality both within and outside the European Union and in this regard the European Parliament's sustained commitment to these issues is vital."
"The world needs women leaders at all levels, be it in local communities or in international politics."
"Women and men must participate on equal terms in the drafting of agendas that affect us all and in the development of solutions to the problems we are facing."
"However, if we look around us, what do we see?"
"Men still make most of the decisions."
"The main examples given in your report clearly demonstrate that the picture is not ideal even for our European democracies and, as you correctly point out, further efforts are needed even inside our respective institutions, the Commission and the Council, to achieve a better gender balance."
"Stereotypes and discrimination persist, biased recruitment and promotion systems are rampant, labour market and educational segregation hinder women in achieving their full potential."
"One of the core factors remains the imbalanced division of work and family responsibilities."
"While the competence to act in this field remains at national level, I am convinced that the Commission can bring real added value by promoting awareness-raising, information gathering, research and analysis, networking and dissemination of best practice."
"This role of the Commission is clearly reflected in our March 2006 Communication 'Roadmap to Gender Equality'. The future European Institute for Gender Equality will also help keep the issue high on the European agenda, collect and analyse data, conduct research and disseminate good practice."
"One priority of the roadmap is promotion of the participation of women and men in decision-making processes."
"Considering that negative gender stereotypes are strongly related to the unequal representation of women, we have chosen their elimination as another key objective for our programme."
"Amongst the Commission's strategic actions for the next five years, the establishment of a European network of women in economic and political decision-making can be highlighted, as well as awareness-raising campaigns, data collection, analysis and exchange of good practices involving all stakeholders to combat gender stereotypes."
"The roadmap also includes the promotion of gender equality outside the European Union."
"As an example of our action in the external policy field, I would like to mention the Five-Year Action Plan on Gender Equality being signed today in Istanbul by Ministers from the 35 countries of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"Women's political participation is one of the key pillars of today's Action Plan that will be supported by a regional project starting in 2007."
"Through the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, we fund several projects promoted women's empowerment."
"As examples I would like to mention the regional project in West Africa aiming at enhancing women's participation in five countries of the region, the regional project in Latin America, seeking to enhance the democratic participation of young people, particularly girls, and the projects undertaken in Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Morocco and Kyrgyzstan to empower women to actively participate in political life."
"It is useful that a reference to elections is included in the report."
"In that context, the Commission has already incorporated the gender perspective into the election observation methodology and women's participation is systematically monitored throughout the Election Observation Missions."
"A good example of this can be seen in the European mission recently deployed to Yemen."
"As you know, the Commission has a strong and long-standing commitment to mainstream gender across the board in our external relations."
"Since 2001, the 'Programme of Action for Mainstreaming Gender Equality in Community Development Cooperation' has given us a framework within which we have implemented an extensive training programme and developed political tools."
"In 2007, in cooperation with the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation, we shall be launching a new capacity-building programme, this time directed principally at our partner governments, civil society and other programme-implementing partners in third countries."
"A specific thematic focus of this programme will be the promotion of women's participation in peace building, along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325."
"Finally, it is clear to me that, although progress has been made, tremendous efforts are still needed to progress towards gender equality and women's effective participation in the political sphere."
"In that respect, the Commission is committed to continuing to mobilise all the instruments available."
"Pressing issues include the following: first, we need a stronger gender focus in electoral, constitutional, legal and judicial matters."
"We need to enhance our support of women's active involvement in defining and implementing policies at national level."
"Secondly, companies need more women at board level to ensure that the widest possible range of thinking, perspectives, experience and abilities is brought to bear on high-level decision-making."
"Third, overcoming gender stereotypes in education, training, the labour market and in the media remains an important challenge in all countries."
"Finally, to achieve gender balance in decision-making, men must be mobilised and fully involved if we want to move ahead."
"Family-friendly policies for women and men, such as more flexible working arrangements and quality childcare facilities, can be of much help."
"Madam President, the initiative by Mrs Gomes to draft a report on women in international politics is praiseworthy because, as the Commissioner also pertinently observed, comparisons of the numbers and figures she presents - from Nobel prizewinners to the number of women who have reached key positions in international politics in the Member States or in international organisations - illustrate the lack of female participation."
"It is incontestable that a democratic society must be represented in a worthy manner by both men and women and that equal participation should start with training and early initiation into the secrets of politics for men and women, without gender discrimination, and with the possibility of linking professional employment in international foreign politics with family life."
"Alongside the rich action and promising plans of the European Union, the Gomes report would retain its value and topical nature if it did not include references to specific national governments and if it did not present lists of countries which have taken measures which cannot be evaluated merely by being referred to."
"The participation of women as a mere physical presence on the international political stage is not enough."
"On the contrary, it must be due to qualifications and abilities evaluated independently of their sex."
"The constitutions and laws of the Member States should support the principle of equal treatment and the parties should promote worthy men and women without discrimination."
"Is this not, however, a question of subsidiarity?"
"Can we dictate the composition of the UN?"
"We shall not therefore support these specific points of the report."
"I do, of course, congratulate the European Commission on its efforts and the European Parliament should support the principle of equality and promote commensurate numbers during the composition of its directorates, delegations representations and delegations."
"We shall only support the specific points of the report to which I referred."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Madam President, the balanced participation of women in decision-making is one of the main challenges of a policy of equal opportunity."
"This matter also figures on the upcoming action programme on equal opportunities."
"This effort must be brought to fruition in all spheres, including external policy, to name but one. For equal opportunity cannot be restricted to the territory of the European Union."
"We must promote the presence of women in political life around the world."
"Our views remain voices in the wilderness if they are not accompanied by the necessary political will."
"For this reason, it is important that at the March Summit six prime ministers, namely those of the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary and Sweden, approved the European Pact for Gender Equality, which extends the perspectives of equal opportunity to our collaboration with the Commission as well."
"This will, hopefully, provide further possibilities both for women's advancement in the workplace and in the creation of a suitable work-family balance."
"My fellow representative has done excellent work, and I propose that we approve the report."
"(SK) I understand why, as a former diplomat and as a woman who has been involved in politics for years, Mrs Gomes has proposed this topic, and I congratulate her on it."
"I fully support the idea that the equal and full participation of women in the political process and in decision-making should fully reflect the true make-up of society."
"Such participation is important for future generations and for the proper functioning of democratic systems."
"There is no doubt that equality between the sexes in terms of dignity and responsibility fully justifies the rise of women to public positions."
"Genuine support for women in politics requires a clear acknowledgement of their value as mothers and their role in the family and this applies in relation to all other public functions and professions."
"In addition, these functions and professions must be closely interlinked if we want social and cultural development to be genuinely and fully humane."
"Let us be honest."
"Women are always deeply involved in life's difficult moments, where they make great peacemakers and mediators par excellence."
"We certainly need to do much more to ensure that the conditions under which women and mothers live and work do not result in any discrimination in the world of politics."
"In the future, women will be increasingly involved in the serious, hotly debated issues of the day."
"It is unusual to see a strong social presence of women in all areas, as women are naturally opposed to a society organised exclusively on the basis of efficiency and productivity, and they insist on redefining these systems in a more humane way."
"In conclusion, I would like to express the wish that all women who are active in politics may become preachers of a new feminism, capable of appreciating and expressing the true talents of women in all areas of social life, without being tempted to imitate the models created by our male counterparts."
"And these are talents aimed at overcoming all forms of discrimination in public administration and in political parties."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, five days ago the United Nations celebrated the 60th anniversary of the creation of the UN Commission on the Status of Women."
"On that occasion Kofi Annan stated that the world is finally starting to grasp that there is no more effective tool for promoting development than the empowerment of women and girls, empowerment, says Annan, that raises economic productivity, reduces infant and maternal mortality, improves nutrition and promotes health."
"The concept of empowerment, first developed by the European Union, was launched with great impetus by the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women, the Beijing Conference, eleven years ago."
"The time has come to revive the idea of empowerment by organising a new world conference."
"In this report we call on the United Nations once again to convene the Fifth World Conference, and we do so with one voice, the European voice, representing 25, soon to be 27, members of the United Nations out of a total of 191 members, a group carrying significant weight."
"This is one of the follow-up actions that we call for in voting for this thorough and balanced report, on which we congratulate the rapporteur."
"(EL) Madam President, it is clear from the previous speeches that there is a lack of participation by women in the exercise of international politics, a record lack you might say, in comparison with other political sectors."
"I therefore thank Mrs Gomes, who has given us the opportunity to debate this issue once again."
"Firstly, because it is a very important issue from the point of view of equilibrium and democracy in the modern world and is a particular dimension of the efforts to achieve equality, justice and, of course, prosperity, as we have already heard."
"The second reason is because this dimension is not usually included in the strategies for equality applied by the Member States and the European Union does not, of course, have the competence to impose it, although it could promote it more bindingly and more effectively."
"The current situation is not satisfactory, as we have heard, nor are the forecasts optimistic, given that, according to surveys, globally we could exceed a level of 30% in the participation of women in national parliaments alone after 2040."
"We therefore need to take a good look at ourselves and to apportion blame honestly, to recognise that simple truths and fundamental values are not being applied in practice as a result of the lack of awareness-raising of and information for society and, of course, the lack of political will in all the agencies, each for its part, as stated in the report and in the amendments tabled by my political group."
"To close, I should like to comment on our responsibilities in the institutions of the European Union."
"Both the European Commission and the European Parliament should routinely include in their external relations the dimension of issues of concern to women and should seek balanced participation, both in their speakers in external relations and in the composition of their delegations."
"(PT) I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Gomes on her excellent report, which addresses a most topical and relevant subject. Women remain under-represented in both national and European political life, and this is no less true of the European Parliament."
"It is incomprehensible that there should be more women than men in universities and increasing numbers of women with masters degrees and doctorates, and that at the same time it is rare to find women in positions of political decision-making or economic power."
"When they reach a certain level there is always a glass ceiling blocking their path."
"Parity is a vital element of democracy itself."
"Experience has shown that a quota system has led to a more equal, and in turn, a fairer and more harmonious, society."
"The Member States must adopt laws that guarantee parity."
"I should like to conclude, Madam President, with a rhetorical question. How different would the world be if it were governed by a female majority?"
"Would Europe not be different, too?"
"(SV) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Gomes for a quite excellent report."
"This issue is extremely important from the perspectives of both gender equality and democracy."
"More than half of Europeans are women."
"The fact is, then, that it is also important from a democratic point of view for women to participate as fully as men in the political decision-making process."
"European policy on equality is based on welfare - something that we must treasure and on which we need to build further, for there are now major deficits where both equality and welfare are concerned."
"It is a question of being able to combine private and professional life."
"We are concerned here with the unequal distribution of family responsibility and with discrimination in employment and professional education."
"We must help each other so that women too are enabled to participate in the political process."
"A country in which power is not divided equally between men and women is not a welfare state in which all are equal."
"In the long run, such a state is good for men too but, in the short term, men need perhaps to give way a little and allow women a little more room."
"In spite of political statements, recommendations, action programmes and special legislation at national level, women are still under-represented in politics."
"What is needed if we are to have equality?"
"I believe, unfortunately, that the only solution is to employ quotas and legislation, which should not be needed."
"If men were to take part in the work to promote gender equality, this major problem could be solved."
"(ES) Madam President, we know that international conflicts affect women in particular: the majority of refugees and displaced persons, for example, are women."
"We must be aware, however, that it is not women who take the decisions that lead to these situations because, as Mrs Gomes's extremely interesting report makes very clear, there are practically no women in the places where decisions are taken on international policy, despite the recommendations of the Beijing Action Programme and Resolution 1325 of the United Nations Security Council and despite the fact that, according to experts, women have a particular gift for negotiation and reaching agreements."
"It is a paradox that the majority of NGOs that play an active role in peace negotiations and post-conflict processes are made up of women."
"The EU institutions must support these women, as the report points out."
"It is urgent that we take all the necessary measures to ensure that there is a balance between men and women in all areas where decisions that affect our collective fate are taken."
"An absence of women represents a democratic deficit."
"The measures proposed by the report in this regard are very courageous and interesting and they are very much in line with those being taken by the government of my country, Spain."
"Congratulations, Mrs Gomes."
"(PL) Madam President, 'Women represent half the potential talent and skills of humanity and their under-representation in decision-making is a loss for society as a whole.'"
"This is a quote from the Athens Ministerial Declaration, which was signed 14 years ago."
"In spite of many similar political declarations, special action programmes and corresponding legislation, the phenomenon of gender discrimination has not disappeared."
"Out of nearly 44 000 members of parliament worldwide, only 16% are women."
"Out of the 191 countries that are currently members of the UN, only seven have a woman as a head of state and eight have a female head of government."
"The under-representation of women in the political and decision-making process is sometimes associated with the difficulties of trying to balance one's social, family and work life, and is also often the result of discrimination at work and in professional education."
"The European Union should set an example to the world in terms of equal opportunities and democracy."
"However, even here, in the European Parliament, women make up only 30% of MEPs."
"Some countries, such as Cyprus or Malta, have no female representatives at all."
"The Member States and political parties throughout Europe should aim to achieve a so-called 'balanced participation' of 40 to 60% of each gender on their lists of candidates."
"Then social representation would really be equitable."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Gomes on her excellent report."
"I hope it will contribute to changing the situation of women in political life."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Fighting trafficking in human beings (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Bauer on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on fighting trafficking in human beings an integrated approach and proposals for an action plan."
"rapporteur. - (SK) Human trafficking is now spoken of as unquestionably the greatest shame of modern times and the most blatant violation of human rights."
"It is also an exceptionally dangerous type of criminal activity, representing the third largest source of revenue after weapons and drugs trafficking, with a turnover in billions of euros and dollars."
"Just today the Vatican issued a statement describing human trafficking as being worse than slave trade."
"Experts estimate that every year approximately one hundred thousand persons in the European Union become victims of human trafficking."
"The most recent findings by Unicef indicate that two thirds of Member States are among the countries of origin and destination."
"The view that this does not apply to us is therefore mistaken."
"Also incorrect is the idea that this is a matter concerning only a few thousand prostitutes, whose fates are often very tragic."
"There are, however, new developments."
"These include the increasing numbers of those affected by human trafficking in connection with forced labour, the provision of services, forced begging by children and petty crime, as well as trafficking for the purposes of illegal adoption or forced marriages."
"A Council of Europe report also refers to evidence of trafficking in human organs in European countries."
"Even though in the vast majority of cases it is women who are the victims, there is alarming evidence that children account for 40-50% of victims."
"The report aims to offer an overview of the problem of human trafficking as a whole."
"It is not about people smuggling or about prostitution per se."
"It is about trafficking in human beings where early identification of the victim is of primary importance."
"In the absence of early identification, the victims themselves may well end up being accused of immigration offences or of involvement in illegal activities and they may be extradited from the country before being given a chance to assist in exposing well organised criminal networks, with a high probability of again falling victim to the same networks."
"In this context it is necessary to emphasise the importance of the European Union's plan as well as the tried and tested approaches, standards and procedures for combating human trafficking which are generally viewed as a major advance in this area."
"I would, however, like to point out four problem areas in the report."
"Firstly, despite the fact that this is an extremely serious crime, the situation in Member States with regard to the relevant legislation and its enforcement is far from satisfactory."
"Five Member States have yet to ratify the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime or its supplementary protocol, known as the Palermo Protocol, to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children."
"As many as ten Members States have not acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child regarding the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography."
"To date, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings has been ratified by only one country, and seven Member States have not signed it."
"There are problems with commitments being honoured."
"In one Member State the crime of trafficking is only punishable by a fine; in another country it is not possible to prosecute trafficking in children who are then forced to beg, as begging per se is not considered a crime; in other countries legal entities may not be prosecuted for committing such crimes."
"Enforcement is also problematic in cases where Member States have all of the means available, for instance through labour law and the existence of labour inspectorates, despite which human trafficking still occurs."
"Secondly, our failings in the area of prevention are no less serious."
"I would like to refer to a shocking finding in a recent Unicef report, according to which as many as 30% of children in the world remain unregistered."
"These children, along with those on the streets, can easily fall victim to criminals."
"Thirdly, victim protection is more than just a humanitarian task."
"There is convincing evidence from Europol that without victim protection we cannot count on being able to expose the well organised networks of criminals and middle men effectively. And yet instead of protecting victims the easier option of criminalisation is often chosen."
"Fourthly, it is obvious that an effective struggle against trafficking calls for enhanced cooperation between the Member States and Europol, Eurojust, Frontex, Unicef and other international organisations, including NGOs."
"A unified method of identifying victims and a unified definition of the underlying crime would greatly help towards a better understanding of new developments and of the overall scale of the problem."
"For now, we can work only with estimates that are regarded as totally unreliable by experts in the field."
"For now, the criminals will continue to have a head start on the law enforcement agencies."
"In conclusion I would like to thank my colleagues who have contributed to improving the report."
"I would also like to express my agreement with an observation made some time ago by Helga Konrad, formerly OCSE special representative on trafficking in human beings."
"The trafficking problem is at a crossroads; we know a lot about it, but there are doubts as to whether we also want to take action."
"Many of us are of the opinion that the time has come for resolute action in combating this particularly serious, dangerous and shameful crime."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this very important report."
"The European policy against trafficking in human beings is a priority not only for this Parliament but also for the European Commission and myself."
"There is a need for further and more effective action to fight trafficking."
"Even though many initiatives have been taken at national and international level, the results are not comparable to the enormous scale of the criminal phenomenon."
"The European action plan approved, as you will remember, last December, is the framework for practical action aimed at tackling all aspects of trafficking."
"I should like to stress some priorities that, in my view, are necessary."
"First, for the Member States, it is essential that they accelerate the application of Directive 2004/81/EC on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal migration and who cooperate with the competent authorities."
"It concerns, in particular, assistance and social reintegration measures, the reflection period and the issuing of the residence permit to victims of trafficking, taking into account also the Council of Europe Convention of 2005."
"In this regard, it is important to point out that the reflection period and assistance measures are granted to victims irrespective of their willingness or capacity to cooperate with the law enforcement authorities and that, after the issuing of the residence permits, victims have access to the labour market, vocational training and education."
"What is the situation so far?"
"Unfortunately, it is very disappointing."
"So far only two Member States have transposed the European directive and only six other notifications of initiatives to transpose have been examined by the European Commission."
"There have been no notifications at all from 12 Member States."
"As you know, the transposition deadline expired on 6 August 2006 and I have therefore decided to start infringement procedures against all Member States that have not yet transposed this very important EU directive."
"Concerning assistance and social reintegration, the need for close cooperation on a regular basis between public authorities, including law enforcement authorities, and NGOs must also be stressed."
"I believe it is very important to have close and permanent cooperation between public authorities and the private sector on protecting and reintegrating victims."
"Concerning investigations, following the initiatives taken by Europol, international police cooperation between Member States' special units should be enhanced."
"I am promoting and encouraging better and closer cooperation between all the specialised national units dealing with countering trafficking in human beings."
"However, on this point, there is a consideration I should like to submit to you."
"With regard to prosecution I note, with disappointment, that very often charges against criminals exploiting victims of trafficking - for example for sexual reasons - are very weak, focusing only on the simple exploitation of prostitution instead of on the very real charge, which should be the reduction of victims to slavery conditions."
"It is up to the prosecutors to decide charges, but I really hope that magistrates and judges will now take a much tougher line than in the past."
"That is the real situation."
"There are also priorities for the European Commission."
"I have decided to set up an expert group on trafficking in human beings."
"That group of experts will deal specifically with indicators and criteria in order to identify different forms of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation."
"In the same context, at the beginning of 2007 I shall propose European legislation on sanctioning employers who exploit illegal workers, whose working conditions are sometimes akin to slavery."
"Concerning trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, we shall shortly be producing a questionnaire aimed at evaluating, inter alia, the possible impact of new legislation criminalising the use of sexual services in the knowledge that the person concerned is a victim of trafficking."
"I am therefore keeping my promise to you about this questionnaire."
"Furthermore, the root causes of trafficking must be addressed, including poverty, lack of job opportunities, gender violence and gender discrimination."
"My departments will shortly be hosting an inter-departmental seminar on this issue, precisely to focus on the main problems that are emerging."
"One last important point is awareness-raising."
"The Commission is supporting the designation of an anti-trafficking day, possibly on 11 June."
"That initiative aims at increasing the visibility of the problems connected with trafficking and the measures taken to counteract trafficking itself."
"It will call for cooperation from public institutions and civil society and evaluate the quality and the results of all the actions that are under way."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, I should begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his very positive speech, and on everything he is doing in this area."
"He is serious about making a difference in combating trafficking, and that needs to be recognised."
"I also want to congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report."
"It has not been an easy report to put together, as various opinions from a number of different committees have had to be incorporated into the final version."
"I was responsible for the Committee on Foreign Affairs' opinion on human trafficking, which concentrated specifically on the external relations aspects of this problem."
"A large number of paragraphs and recommendations from my opinion have been incorporated into the text of the report and I thank Mrs Bauer for her cooperation in that regard."
"I wanted this evening to comment primarily on foreign relations issues."
"The report stresses the need for Member States to sign up to international conventions, ensuring a positive obligation on countries to address issues relating to trafficking."
"The Irish Government, for example, has not ratified the UN Convention against transnational organised crime and the protocol to that Convention to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking."
"This anti-trafficking convention and protocol have been ratified by 121 States across the world, including most European countries, but seven EU Member States are still to ratify, which is unacceptable."
"The report also urges EU Member States to implement the Council Directive on residence permits so that the option of temporary residence can be granted to victims of trafficking."
"This is absolutely necessary in order to shift the focus away from viewing trafficked people as illegal immigrants and towards treating them as victims of abuse."
"It will also encourage victims to come forward to the police by assuring them of compassionate and fair treatment."
"One of the core elements of the Committee on Foreign Affairs' opinion is that the Council and the Commission should regularly raise the issue of human trafficking in political dialogues with third countries."
"The human rights clauses written into EU agreements with those countries should be used, where appropriate, to raise concerns on trafficking."
"There is clear evidence in various regions of the globe that pressure from governments, international organisations and NGOs is starting to have an effect on attitudes towards trafficking."
"The EU has a responsibility to raise the profile, by all available means, of the continuing scandal of what amounts to modern-day slavery."
"Europe needs to set an example if it is to insist on other parts of the world following its lead."
"I am not satisfied - and this was confirmed to me by the Commissioner's remarks - that EU Governments are serious about this issue."
"That has to change, and this report is a step in the right direction."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report."
"As has been said, I drafted the opinion for the Committee on Employment, where we focused on those people who were effectively trafficked for labour purposes."
"Indeed, one of the things I welcome in this report is its recognition of the wide variety of reasons for people being trafficked."
"My committee particularly welcomes the human rights-based approach of the integrated action plan, and recognises that this requires an emphasis, as the Commissioner said, on the forced labour or services, slavery and slavery-like outcomes of trafficking."
"We have seen evidence of these slavery-like outcomes only too recently, in the shape of workers who have no choice of when, where or how they work."
"They have no rights."
"Their accommodation is tied."
"They may find themselves beaten, deprived of any medical treatment, deprived of water in high temperatures, and sometimes, as was the case in Morecombe Bay in the UK, they are left to die."
"When looking at the causes, the committee also examined the issue of demand and considered that the demand for low-cost, undocumented and docile workers in the European Union contributes to the illegal trade of trafficking in human beings."
"It believes that the existence of such a workforce may drive down costs but that this is at the expense of human dignity and an undermining of labour standards, health and safety measures and fair pay and of local and/or state income, through a failure to pay taxes and social contributions."
"We welcome the view expressed in this report that we should be looking, for example, at the dubious employment agencies that apply both for EU nationals and third country nationals, and which have become a front for these slavery-like outcomes."
"We believe that there is a need to apply existing labour law and to network the information from labour inspectorates to bring it within the sphere of police intelligence so that we can stop or disrupt trafficking."
"We also consider training to be an important dimension of that for those inspectorates."
"We recognise the importance of good company practice where compliance is genuinely sought all the way down the line, and we also recognise the valuable work of networks, trade unions and reputable companies in helping to prevent trafficking and deal with the victims."
"On a personal note, I very much welcome the action the Commissioner has said he intends to take on the issue of temporary residence permits."
"I deeply regret the action of my own Member State, for example, which views victims, as Mr Coveney said, predominantly as illegal migrants rather than as victims."
"The police tell us that those who are deported are often retrafficked around and around in a vicious circle, rather than being seen as vulnerable individuals, or indeed as potential sources of information."
"I very much welcome what the Commissioner has said, and the report, and look forward to this being followed up with very strong action."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - This report is the result of enhanced cooperation, pursuant to Rule 47, between two committees, LIBE and FEMM."
"I am therefore partly responsible for this report, specifically the parts dealing with trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation."
"Seventeen years: that is the age of the typical victim of trafficking in Europe."
"She is a young girl ending up in a brothel or in a so-called escort service in Germany, Austria or the Netherlands."
"Seventeen years: that is the same length of time that this Parliament has been debating and producing papers on the issue of trafficking."
"People say that we should stick to what we have been doing in this Parliament until now."
"But I say we have to stop the wishful thinking and the empty talk and resolutions and start dealing with this issue in a practical way."
"First, we have to identify the enemy."
"It is organised crime."
"While we have been talking, they have changed their agenda from weapons and drugs to the more profitable buying and selling of human beings for the sex industry."
"We are talking commodities."
"We are talking merchandise."
"We are talking regular markets where naked young girls are sold to the highest bidder."
"We are talking about girls who are sold at the age of 17 and at the age of 20 are worthless and thrown aside."
"I have met them and listened to unbelievable horrors of being raped 14 times a day."
"Do we want to end this, or do we just want to go on talking?"
"This organised crime industry feeds on the demands of ordinary men who believe they have a right to buy the body of a young girl as cheaply as possible."
"Some people say trafficking in women and girls for sexual exploitation is already a crime, while prostitution is merely a matter of consenting adults making a business transaction."
"But more than 90% of the girls in the sex industry in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, where prostitution is legal, are from abroad."
"How can you know that this girl is doing it of her own free will?"
"How can you be sure she is not smiling only because she knows someone will threaten her family back home if she does not comply?"
"If you see this as just another job, how come you would not want your daughter to do it?"
"Or your own wife?"
"The demand from men to buy sex is also a driving force in the trafficking business."
"If you agree with me that we need to really do something about trafficking, please join me in voting against Amendments 23, 24 and 25 tomorrow."
"Commissioner Frattini, I am very grateful for your work, but we are still awaiting the study on how the laws on prostitution in Europe affect the number of trafficking victims."
"That is needed if we are to find the best practice."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Trafficking in human beings is a modern version of slavery."
"It is not a recent phenomenon. It has been growing in recent years and has reached alarming levels."
"The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that there are some 2.5 million people in forced labour throughout the world."
"This is already the third most lucrative form of trafficking, after drugs and arms."
"It manifests itself in the form of sexual exploitation, as previous speakers have mentioned, as well as abusive working conditions, forced domestic labour, illegal adoption, forced begging and the sale of organs."
"Fighting the trafficking in human beings is therefore one of the major priorities at both Community and international level."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to commend Mrs Bauer on her excellent report."
"We agree that there needs to be a coherent European policy on fighting the trafficking in human beings effectively, one that covers all aspects of the issue, including questions relating to countries of origin, transit and destination, people who recruit and exploit and other middlemen, customers and beneficiaries."
"Victims and witnesses must be protected, and prevention strategies must be put forward."
"Trafficking in human beings is unacceptable and legal loopholes must not be allowed to facilitate it."
"The law needs to be clear and far-reaching, and must be implemented and correctly enforced by all Member States."
"There needs to be a legal platform acting as a basis for stepping up international cooperation, and I am appalled that it has taken such a long time to ratify and implement various international instruments, such as UN conventions."
"I would call on the Member States that have yet to do so to take the necessary measures at the earliest opportunity."
"In this connection, let me commend Mr Frattini for his remarks in the Chamber today regarding penalising those Member States that are late in adopting the transposed Community directives."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking Mrs Bauer for her sterling report and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for its constructive cooperation and for its enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"I also want to thank Commissioner Frattini."
"During the two and a half years that I have sat in the European Parliament, the issue of trafficking in human beings has assumed a prominent place on the political agenda, not only in the European Parliament but also in the Member States and among Europeans."
"That is a good beginning."
"I am very pleased that we are united in condemning people trafficking, as we were in condemning it in the context of the football World Cup."
"I welcome the fact that we are now also including other aspects of people trafficking and that we are agreed that what we are talking about in this case is a modern slave trade, at least 80% of whose victims are women and children."
"What worries me is the lack of analysis of what happens to the women and children once they have actually reached the EU."
"It does not help to be outraged by cross-border trafficking if one does not see, or does not want to talk about, what happens subsequently in the EU."
"Those who purchase sexual services buy women and children indiscriminately in an equally indiscriminate EU market."
"Whenever I have met trafficked women, they have said that they have been bought and that they have been sold into prostitution and marketed to clients in a great many EU countries day in, day out, all year round."
"This has been possible because we, here in the EU, still do not dare to talk about those women and children who are here right now."
"It is time to change attitudes."
"The next step is for us to obtain more knowledge."
"The fact that 50% of those sold into prostitution are children is scandalous."
"We should be ashamed of ourselves every day for not doing more, because we in the EU have a responsibility for children's rights."
"I am proud to tell you that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are agreed as to how we want to move forward."
"We wish to set targets, carry out studies and become better informed."
"We shall then perhaps be able to agree on what is required in the short and long terms."
"If you other political groups want to know what we are doing, I can tell you that we are preparing the way for a debate on various possible ways of putting an end to people trafficking in Member States, for example through the legalisation of prostitution or, as in Sweden, through a law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services."
"Why is the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats afraid of university studies?"
"That is something I should like to know."
"Merely to be opposed to people trafficking this evening is simply to say that we in the European Parliament are concerned about the matter. We are, however, putting our heads, ostrich-like, in the sand and not assuming responsibility for what is happening to all those women and children who are being exploited here and now."
"Many people say that we in the EU do little but talk when we should be setting practical targets."
"The PSE Group and I therefore want us to set the EU a target whereby it is to halve the number of people exposed to people trafficking within ten years."
"The PSE Group also supports Amendments 1 to 22 and recital P. We shall abstain in the vote on recital O because we are not adopting a position either in favour of, or against, an individual investigation."
"On Amendment 25, we shall each vote in our own way."
"I shall vote in favour of paragraph 1(al) and against Amendment 25, and this on the basis of my political experience of the view taken of the sex trade and prostitution in Sweden."
"What is most important now is to pursue the 50% reduction in people trafficking and to implement the planned investigation in the EU in 2007."
"I want to thank all my fellow citizens for this debate. I also want to thank all those who have participated in the debate here in the House, together with the President and Commissioner Frattini."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I thought I would give a different speech to the one I have written down, as much of what I wanted to say has been said."
"This is a good debate in which it is important for us to underline the fact that the issue in question is one that must be dealt with, both through the ratification of conventions and through work on the great social inequalities."
"Let me state, then, that getting conventions ratified is not enough."
"They also need to be complied with."
"I am in a position to say that, in a country like Denmark alone, all too few resources are set aside for combating the sex trade."
"There is not enough investigation, and those women who are the victims of the trade have no more than 30 days before they are kicked out of the country."
"There is sufficient time neither for them to get the help they need nor for anything to be done about the problem."
"We then ask ourselves whether this is because we do, in reality, accept that there can be trafficking in women and children."
"On this point I personally do, in fact, agree with the Swedes that it has proved that, when there is a market, then it is all too very easy both to create an acceptance of the fact that this activity can take place and also, of course, to make things easier for the criminals."
"It is very easy for them to gain access to an already established market with their victims and, until something is done about that, I really do not think that we will truly be able to stamp out this trade."
"This is a debate we must have because it is incredibly important that we get something done about this issue."
"As I say, I wish, personally, to support the Swedish proposal but I am also incredibly open to other things, as long as we establish that it is not just ratifications that are needed but changes of attitude and that funding also needs to be set aside to provide real help because, until all this happens, all that we shall have, as my Swedish fellow Member said before I got up to speak, is little more than words."
"I can tell you that even the finest of targets do not help the people who are being trafficked if they are not backed up by proper powers, political will and proper effort. I hope, then, that this is something we can agree on."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (The speaker spoke Irish)"
"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Edit Bauer, for the considerable work that has gone into the series of proposals contained in the recommendations for an integrated approach to fighting trafficking in human beings."
"Given that this problem is on the rise, an integrated approach is required and one which takes full account of the importance of prevention and the crucial issue of reducing demand."
"I welcome the report's call for EU Member States and the Council to strengthen the human-rights-based, gender-equality and victim-centred approach to this issue."
"It is essential that the trafficking of people be dealt with as a human rights issue, rather than being seen mainly as an issue of border control."
"Trafficking is primarily about exploitation, not illegal migration."
"It is unacceptable that in some countries there is no legislative provision for residence permits for the victims of trafficking and in other states, where provision is made; it is linked to the victims' cooperation with police."
"Some victims clearly will not be able to provide useful information."
"They will be too traumatised to do so."
"I too welcome the Commissioner's comments here tonight."
"I think they underline the long overdue need for action by governments, including my own."
"The report contains important measures for protecting victims and shows the extent of the protection measures that are needed."
"These have to be included and resourced as part, as a major part in fact, of any action plan and implementation of that plan."
"I agree with other speakers that ratifying conventions is good, action plans are good, but we actually have to see the action to see this worked through."
"Identifying the victims of trafficking is, of course, crucial to ensuring that they receive the services they require."
"Training for those who come into contact with undocumented migrants is therefore important."
"The report also points out that measures are required to ensure the protection of not only victims of sexual exploitation but also victims of labour exploitation and other forms of trafficking."
"European governments therefore have to understand that an integral part of the fight against trafficking is the introduction of measures to strengthen workers' rights to protect migrant workers."
"I think we need to look not only at the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings but also at ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families."
"That too has to be an essential part of tackling trafficking in human beings."
"(SK) I welcome this important report and I would also like to express my thanks to Mrs Edit Bauer for her work."
"I am glad that some of my amendments have been adopted in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, and I trust that they too have contributed to the quality of this report."
"Trafficking in human beings is one of the most sophisticated, best organised and most profitable forms of criminal activity."
"This is a problem not only for the developing world, but also for the European Union."
"In my amendments I focused on the fact that most of the victims of sexual abuse and trafficking in human beings are minors, who constitute the most vulnerable section of the population."
"For instance, the consent of a child to prostitution may not be viewed in the same way as the consent of an adult who is aware of the consequences of his or her conduct."
"Many international agreements and treaties have been signed on this issue."
"However, many states have not even ratified these instruments and those that have ratified them fail to enforce them, which results in these documents becoming irrelevant."
"Although at international conferences attended by various states we all agree that we really must implement these documents to which we all subscribe, such efforts frequently cease on the last day of the conference and the status quo remains unchanged."
"In addition to focusing on the customer-victim relationship, it is necessary to pay attention to employers, especially in countries where visa requirements are not applied."
"Cooperation must exist between the three elements, that is, the country of origin, the transit countries and the destination countries."
"It is necessary to monitor the operation and trustworthiness of employment agencies, including those that are thought to recruit only seasonal workers."
"Companies that employ cheap labour obtained through human trafficking must be punished extremely heavily."
"Inspections at facilities providing sexual services will not suffice."
"It would be desirable also to have administrative inspections in addition to the penalties set out under criminal law."
"The funding available to the non-governmental organisations that deal with political rights is many times greater than that available to NGOs addressing human trafficking or women's rights."
"Sadly, this appears to reflect how countries have set their priorities."
"(HU) Mr President, I can only congratulate Mrs Edit Bauer for having addressed this sad and very serious question with such professional expertise and commitment."
"We can only support her in this at the vote tomorrow."
"Thanks are due as well to Mr Frattini, for the same degree of commitment."
"For this is what is necessary, given that trafficking in human beings, and especially in women and children, has since the 1990s grown into one of the world's most alarming phenomena."
"No doubt everyone has heard astonishing figures - we have listened to and discussed these here today."
"I am particularly saddened by the fact that 40-50% of all victims are children."
"According to UNICEF's estimate, one million children each year are caught up in the international trafficking in children."
"One of the roots of the problem is the hopeless situation in the countries of origin."
"But we must also recognise that the principal motor driving the trade is demand."
"Human traffickers would not succeed if the host states did not have such a large demand for women and children to exploit, that is, for cheap labour."
"It makes no difference that practically the whole world condemns this sexual exploitation or slavery of children, and the police forces of individual countries strive in vain to uncover paedophile rings, if trafficking in human beings remains largely international in scope."
"Therefore, we must strengthen cross-border cooperation to protect the victims, bring the offenders effectively to justice and work out comprehensive methods of prevention."
"Currently, human trafficking is the most rapidly growing criminal activity within the European Union."
"The struggle against trafficking of women and children is a moral question as well, and I have no doubt that it is our duty to intervene against it."
"It is sad to see that the European Parliament has to debate this issue, here among these empty benches, for in my view, this question somehow affects all of us, since it is our children who are at stake."
"(PT) Trafficking in human beings is a heinous crime that, in a particularly insidious fashion, debases the very nature of what it is to be a human being."
"Unfortunately, it has become one of the most lucrative forms of international organised crime. It affects hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, and in particular the weakest and the poorest, women and children."
"The fight against this scourge ought to be an immediate priority."
"For this fight to be successful, international cooperation must be stepped up in the areas of investigation, exchange of information, identification of victims, law enforcement and reintegration."
"Accordingly, those Member States that have yet to do so must speed up the process of ratifying and implementing the many existing international conventions that could make a decisive contribution towards gradually eradicating this utterly abhorrent crime."
"The EU, too, must strengthen its commitment to promoting initiatives aimed at combating the causes of this most disgraceful trade, and must support the weakest countries in which most of this trafficking originates."
"As we debate this matter here in the Chamber, we must all be aware of the enormous difficulty of the war that we must wage together. We must be clear in our minds that we are fighting to defend human dignity."
"There is therefore, ladies and gentlemen, no more urgent fight than this."
"(PL) Mr President, the fight against human trafficking is a great challenge for the twenty-first century."
"In the struggle for human dignity, and in order to limit this phenomenon, international and national organisations have signed a series of declarations, conventions and directives, and are implementing a series of action plans."
"As the rapporteur has pointed out, these action plans may restrict human trafficking in its broadest sense, but they do not eliminate its causes."
"The causes include: unemployment, hunger, poverty affecting large parts of society, high indirect labour costs, competition and the desire to achieve maximum profit."
"They often encourage illegal work and permit local communities to turn a blind eye to slave labour (an example would be the case of the area surrounding the Italian town of Foggia), sexual abuse, ethnic conflicts and wars."
"This report could provide the basis for drawing up a programme for further economic, legal, political, educational, informative and institutional actions."
"Implementing this programme would restrict human trafficking, which goes against the principles of democracy and human dignity."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Bauer's report not only affords us an in-depth analysis of this ghastly state of affairs, but also very wide-ranging proposals as to how strategies to combat people-trafficking - one of the cruellest branches of organised crime - may be successfully implemented."
"These proposals range from the improvement of the legal framework to improved coordination of the most diverse measures at national and European level, taking in also the action needed in order to reduce demand and to protect the victims."
"While I support them, I would also suggest that corrections be made at a few points, with it being prescribed in detail to the Member States what measures they are to take in order to protect victims, with regard to such things as access to the labour market, to accommodation, to education and so on, irrespective of whether or not the said victim is willing to cooperate with the authorities."
"It is in these respects that the Member States should take appropriate action to protect the victims, albeit not of such a nature as to drive more of them into the clutches of the people-traffickers."
"I am particularly grateful to Commission Frattini for taking very definite action that will have a lasting effect, and am very supportive of his action in now threatening that those Member States that have not hitherto been willing to implement and transpose the relevant directives, regulations and international conventions will have to face the consequences."
"Their attitude is simply unacceptable, and the Member States must now do something in response to the requirements imposed by the UN and the European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has addressed a very important issue which is of great socio-political significance."
"Human trafficking is a problem on a global scale and is a modern version of slavery which infringes fundamental human rights."
"The trafficking of women and children is a particularly tragic side of this phenomenon."
"In my speech, I would like to focus on the economic aspects of this phenomenon."
"It should be stressed that human trafficking is driven by the forces of both supply and demand."
"In some developing countries, in contrast to the levels of social and economic development in Europe, there are few prospects for the future in terms of the economic and social situation, unemployment is high and there is growing poverty."
"These factors contribute towards a situation where it is easy for criminal organisations to profit through human trafficking."
"However, we should also take into account the fact that the demand for cheap, unregistered and obedient workers in the European Union contributes to the illegal trade in human beings, as using such a workforce can cut costs."
"However, this is done at the expense of human dignity and undermines employment standards, health and safety, fair pay and local and national budgets through unpaid taxes and social security contributions."
"Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal activity amongst the forms of organised crime in the European Union."
"The measures taken to restrict human trafficking to date have yet to produce tangible results."
"There are obvious difficulties involved in combating this phenomenon, but the European Union must take decisive action."
"That is why we should gladly adopt the report before us, which proposes an integrated approach, and the proposed action plan."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is women and children who are most vulnerable to human trafficking, and it is unfortunate that the world of sport deserves some of the blame in this respect."
"More and more, professional sports clubs resort to attracting ever younger players, particularly from Africa, for the obvious reason that they pay very little, if anything, for them."
"These players are often simply dumped along the way, and subsequently go underground."
"Too little attention is given to this."
"In our draft report on the future of professional football in Europe, we demand that the Commission should deal with this in the context of the Council's framework decision on the fight against human trafficking."
"Since, Commissioner, this decision makes no bones about the fact that the exploitation of children is punishable, we want the Member States to introduce hefty penalties for it."
"May I remind you in this connection of the agreements that were concluded at the European Summit in The Hague two years ago?"
"The European Council then recommended that a European plan be drawn up in order to develop common standards, best practices and suchlike to prevent and fight human trafficking."
"I have to tell Commissioner Frattini that this issue is becoming all the more urgent and acute because some professional football clubs intend to circumvent and undermine the so-called 'home-grown' rule by attracting ever younger players to Western Europe, or Europe in general."
"This often involves entire families moving, only for many of them later to be left to their own devices."
"I would like to add that we give our 100% backing to this home-grown rule that has already been implemented by UEFA, because it benefits the training of young footballers."
"Moreover, on the basis of initial discussions here in the parliamentary committees, it seems that this home-grown rule meets with broad support here in Parliament."
"We must, whatever we do, rule out the risk of this measure being undermined, and that is why I urge you to support the amendment which I, along with the rapporteur, have submitted to that effect."
"My question is, of course, addressed to the Members in this Chamber, but also to the Commission and ministers."
"- (LT) I would like to thank the rapporteur for doing such an enormously important work."
"Europe has long been proud that slavery was eradicated here sooner than on any other continent."
"Sadly, it is returning in other forms that are equally repulsive, along with scorn, distress and, ironically, unimaginable profits."
"What should we do first?"
"We should coordinate the actions of the EU and all neighbouring countries better, eliminate legal gaps enabling offenders to evade law enforcement without being punished, even hand out to all Members of the European Parliament a kind of 'shame list' of states, which have failed to ratify United Nations conventions on trafficking in human beings, and draft a code of conduct for officers of EU institutions and bodies, which would even be useful for some Members of Parliament."
"We must make our citizens, especially those in the new EU Member States, clearly aware of the possible threats of becoming a target of traffickers in people."
"The victims of offenders must not only have the courage but also the right to be able to address governmental institutions without being afraid of deportation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Written Statement (Rule 142)"
"(IT) I worked as draftsman for the Committee on Development on the Financial Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, together with the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Our committee has voted for an amendment including the fight against trafficking in women and children, who represent almost all the people trafficked, among the projects that can be funded using this instrument, primarily to help the countries at the origin of the trafficking to combat this dishonourable practice."
"However, few projects, even if well targeted, are not enough to combat a problem concerning over a million victims a year, above all women, teenage girls and children."
"A legal framework regulating prostitution, close collaboration between the Member States and, above all, with the countries of origin of the majority of victims, as well as extremely harsh punishments for those promoting this trafficking, are necessary tools to try to bring an end to this scourge."
"However, we also need to implement a strong dissuasion and awareness campaign for all Europeans that feed people trafficking, primarily through sex tourism."
"Finally, I would like to extend my support to the committee's proposals for actions supporting victims, helping them to come out into the open, denounce their traffickers and become rehabilitated in European society."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.30 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting opened at 10.00)"
"Mr President, I rise simply to report to the House the good news that last night the President of Pakistan, who was our guest a few weeks ago, has commuted the death sentence on my constituent Mirza-Tahir Hussain, who had been on death row for 18 years but is widely regarded to be innocent of the charges against him."
"A number of Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Karim, were going to Pakistan next month to make a final plea."
"Now, of course, we shall turn our efforts towards ensuring Mr Hussain can return to Leeds by Christmas."
"I am delighted at this news and hope that the President of Parliament will make a statement later today."
"I know he has worked very hard on this case, as have other Members of Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Ombudsman's 2005 annual report (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Andreas Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2005."
"Ombudsman."
"Mr President, I wish to thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament and to present the annual report for 2005, a year in which the Office of the European Ombudsman celebrated an important milestone: its tenth year of operation."
"The annual report records our progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making the Ombudsman's work better known to citizens."
"In total, 3920 complaints were received, a 5% increase compared to the previous year."
"I note that a rise in complaints does not necessarily result from worsening administrative behaviour by the European Union's institutions; rather, it may also reflect citizens' increased general awareness of matters European and growing knowledge about their rights and about how to exercise those rights."
"This general awareness was also observed during 2005 in the participation of citizens in the debate about the future of the European Union and the Constitution."
"To contribute to the furthering of this general awareness, I made intensive efforts to inform citizens about their rights and to spread the word about the positive results that have been achieved in defence of those rights."
"All in all, I and my staff gave over 170 public lectures, presentations and press interviews, in addition to meeting with ombudsmen, public officials and other interlocutors in the Member States."
"A particular feature of these communication activities in 2005 was a series of events to mark the tenth anniversary of the Ombudsman, directed at specific target groups, namely, civil society, academia, the press and the institutions themselves, including a reception in honour of the European Parliament on 27 September, which was addressed by President Borrell Fontelles himself."
"During 2005, I was able to assist over 75% of the people who complained to me."
"This assistance took the form of opening an inquiry, transferring the case to a competent body, or advising on where to turn for a prompt and effective solution to the problem."
"I closed 312 inquiries during the year."
"In 36% of the cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration."
"Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institutional body involved."
"Furthermore, even when there is no maladministration I may identify an opportunity for the institutional body to improve the quality of its administration in the future."
"If so, I make a further remark in closing my decision."
"Wherever I find maladministration, I try if possible to achieve a positive-sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution."
"In 30% of cases my inquiry has resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the satisfaction of the complainant, or in a friendly solution."
"When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark or make a draft recommendation."
"One of the draft recommendations accepted in 2005 was a case in which the Commission granted ex gratia compensation to a complainant whose project it had cancelled at extremely short notice."
"The Commission agreed to pay EUR 56 000, the largest such settlement ever secured by the Ombudsman."
"If a Community institutional body fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, the Ombudsman's ultimate weapon is a special report to Parliament."
"Three special reports were made in 2005: on the Council's continuing practice of legislating in camera; on the Commission's responsibility for children of its officials with special educational needs; and on the nature of information provided by OLAF to the Ombudsman during a previous enquiry."
"I am grateful to Parliament for its support as expressed in its resolutions of 4 and 6 April 2006, based on the Hammerstein Mintz and De Rossa reports respectively and concerning the first two of these special reports."
"I would now like to say a few words about my priorities for the future."
"As indicated before, the first priority is to promote a citizen-centred approach by the EU institutions and bodies in all their activities."
"To that end I seek every opportunity to reach out to EU institutions, to encourage best practice and promote friendly solutions."
"The active cooperation of the institutions and bodies is essential to the success of the Ombudsman's work for citizens."
"The annual report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to my proposals and recommendations."
"During visits to the institutions and bodies, I underlined the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints."
"The ultimate goal for all of us must be to ensure the best possible service to the citizen."
"The Commission has already taken constructive steps to improve its service to citizens by overhauling its system of handling the Ombudsman's inquiries resulting from complaints."
"In its communication of November 2005 the Commission outlined the new procedure to apply henceforth."
"Commissioner Wallström's idea in designing the new procedure was to give individual Commissioners greater ownership of cases, while fully maintaining the valuable role of the Secretariat-General."
"I am particularly grateful for her efforts in bringing that concept to fruition and for her continuing commitment to its proper implementation."
"The new procedure allows individual Commissioners to get involved in cases at an early stage, when options still remain open."
"The speed of the new procedure already bore fruit in a case in which I found that the Commission's response to a citizen's infringement complaint had been unsatisfactory."
"I held a meeting with Commissioner McCreevy and learned from him that the Commission had taken steps to resolve that particular issue."
"I believe that the successful resolution of that case illustrates the value both of the Ombudsman's role in promoting good administration in the infringement procedure and of the concept of greater ownership of cases by individual Commissioners."
"I wish to thank the Commission for that in the presence of Vice-President Wallström."
"I have also revisited the question of the Ombudsman's Statute by submitting to President Borrell Fontelles in July considered proposals for revision, in response to earlier resolutions on the Ombudsman's annual report by this House."
"Overall the Statute continues to provide a good framework for the Ombudsman's investigations and for effective cooperation with the institutions to promote good administration and fight maladministration."
"The changes I propose are therefore limited both in number and scope."
"My principal objective is to ensure that citizens can have full confidence in the Ombudsman's power to find the truth when hearing witnesses or inspecting documents."
"I should also like to cooperate with Parliament to ensure that citizens' complaints about violations of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Charter can be brought before the Court of Justice if an important issue of principle cannot be resolved in any other way."
"Parliament already has full rights as an institution to initiate cases before the Court."
"In this context, it would be useful for the Ombudsman to have the power to intervene in such cases, a power that has already been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor, with whom I have developed a close working relationship."
"I look forward to working with Mr Guardans Cambó and Mrs Matsouka as they embark upon the process of drawing up a report and opinion concerning this proposed vision in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Petitions respectively."
"My third priority is to deepen my close cooperation with ombudsmen in the Member States through the European Network of Ombudsmen."
"The aim is to promote good administration throughout the Union in order that citizens can enjoy their rights under European law."
"I am delighted that the Committee on Petitions participates in the Network as a full member and was represented at the meeting of national ombudsmen that took place in The Hague in September 2005."
"Next week, a similar meeting for regional ombudsmen in the European Union, with whom I have made a commitment to meet every two years, will be held in London."
"I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Petitions, and in particular this year's rapporteur Mr Schwab, for their support and constructive proposals as set out in Parliament's report."
"I have already mentioned today many of the matters on which the report contains wise advice to the Ombudsman."
"I am committed to improving the information given to Parliament and citizens about the services provided by me and by the European Network of Ombudsmen."
"I have already asked to appear before the Committee on Petitions whenever I submit a special report to this House."
"Next year, I intend to put an interactive guide on our website to help complainants find the appropriate ombudsman to deal with, be it at European, national or regional level."
"I believe this will be of great benefit to citizens and help address the concerns rightly expressed in Mr Schwab's report about the large percentage of inadmissible complaints."
"Last year we successfully consolidated the Office of the European Ombudsman and moved firmly in the direction of enhancing the institution's ability to deal effectively with complaints and inquiries from citizens of the enlarged European Union."
"To that end, we could always count upon the support of two of Parliament's most senior officials who are about to retire or have just retired - Mr Priestley and Mr Garzón Clariana."
"Their wise counsel and assistance to the Ombudsman have been invaluable and will long be remembered."
"I believe that the relationship of goodwill, trust and understanding built up over the last decade between the European Ombudsman and EU institutions constitutes a precious resource for improving the quality of public administration in Europe to the benefit of citizens."
"It is enormously reassuring to me, both personally and institutionally, to know that in this regard the European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions are vital partners for the European Ombudsman."
"I intend to make the most of that partnership in seeking to contribute to the deepening of a service culture to the benefit of EU citizens."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that you have all managed to get up so early and be present here for the debate on the report on the 2005 report from the European Ombudsman."
"I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Diamandouros, most warmly for the constructive contribution you have made in the shape of your annual report, on which I have had the privilege of reporting to this House on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, and I would like, in so doing, also to thank all the Members of this House who, by their amendments and personal comments, have played a constructive part in the report's gestation, especially our coordinator Mr Atkins and my predecessor from last year, Mr Mavrommatis."
"I am glad that you started by highlighting the need for the Ombudsman's status to be specified in rather clearer terms in view of the increasing workload with which the public present you, and I am most obliged to you for having actually done that again today."
"Since we should try to draw the demarcation lines between the functions of the different European institutions as sharply and distinctly as possible, the deliberations on your letter to our President, Mr Borrell, may well bring us to a satisfactory outcome."
"The European Ombudsman is an important European institution, being particularly relevant to Europe's development and with a special importance in the eyes of the European public."
"He exists to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and to make it transparent."
"It is to him that Europe's citizens can turn in order to complain when the institutions do not do their jobs properly; that gives him a very personal relationship with Europe, one that cannot be the same everywhere, and that is what makes his position so special."
"It is this idea - the idea that European policy should be shaped more by practical considerations and by reference to the interests of the public - that we should, in future, take more to heart."
"We must focus our policies more closely on the public and thereby show them that they and their concerns - be these major or minor, important or trivial - are taken seriously, and we will accomplish that firstly by making a better job of communicating what European policy is all about, and secondly, by way of greater transparency - two important points from among those I have made about your annual report."
"The Committee on Petitions has received the European Ombudsman's annual report, which discusses his activities over the past year, and that leads me to thank you for doing a splendid job of work."
"You have been in office since 1 April 2003, and your labours are being crowned with success."
"I believe that the report that this House has produced is a very balanced one; I have endeavoured to examine the Members' amendments and, where I thought it possible, to incorporate them."
"I believe that the report is comprehensible to the public, and that is the most important thing, but, following the vote in committee, I assumed that not all the amendments could be re-submitted, and I will, for that reason, be recommending to my group that it should reject them."
"For that I ask your understanding."
"We have spent a long time trying to compromise on this point."
"You have already set out the most important points from your report."
"The year 2005 saw a large number of complaints - the largest, indeed, ever made to the Ombudsman - and the first thing that indicates is that more and more people are taking an active interest in the EU and in the way it works."
"What is shocking, though - and this is something to which you referred - is the continuing large number of complaints - amounting to some 70% of those made - that are not actually within your remit, very often because the people making them do not know with any certainty to whom they actually need to address themselves, and it is for that reason that I very much welcome your statement to the effect that you want an online form set up on your homepage as a guide to the right institution; that would certainly be useful to all those who want to contact you online."
"It follows, then, that the powers and responsibilities of the institutions need to be demarcated even more clearly in order that the public may understand who, in the European Union, is responsible for dealing with what, and you can help to make the tangled undergrowth of institutions and their powers more transparent, something that is, of course, in the first instance a task for Parliament and for its Members in the electoral districts in the relevant regions, but you can play your part too."
"We extend a very warm welcome to the European Network of Ombudsmen and similar bodies, which take quite different forms from one Member State to another, and we have, for that reason, particularly highlighted their public information events."
"Turning to the substance of the various complaints, they focus primarily on a lack of transparency, and so, in that the report repeats the Ombudsman's demands - made in his special report on the subject - for all meetings of the Council in its legislative capacity to be open to the public, you have served the cause of democracy and transparency in Europe well."
"We also, though, need more transparency if the democratic functioning of the European Union is to be guaranteed, and hence, in our report - and in saying this, I am perhaps addressing you, Commissioner Wallström, more than anyone else - we call for the 'europa.eu' Internet portal to be redesigned as a means of access to all the institutions and for a clear guide to the various European institutions - rather than a catalogue of all the European Union's activities - to be positioned on the homepage."
"Finally, I should like to give voice to another thought, namely that it was in January that you presented your annual report for the past year, yet it is only now - in November of the following year - that we are debating it."
"We in the Committee on Petitions should endeavour to discuss these reports as soon as possible after they are published."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, for his work on the European Ombudsman's report on his activities in 2005."
"This is an important report from Parliament on the general principles, the state of play and future development of cooperation between the Ombudsman and other EU institutions."
"I would also like to congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, on his annual report."
"I am happy, as always, to hear Mr Diamandouros confirm his commitment to ensuring the highest standards of administration in the European institutions, and that is a commitment the Commission shares."
"I entirely support Mr Schwab in his endorsement of the role of the Ombudsman as an external monitoring mechanism for sound administration."
"Through his work, the Ombudsman contributes to the promotion of good administration."
"I am convinced that, through their cooperation with the Ombudsman, EU institutions are helped in fostering a citizen-oriented approach to their daily work."
"That means ensuring greater transparency of the EU decision-making process and working to develop best practices to meet citizens' expectations and safeguard their rights."
"This is about bridging the gap between institutions and EU citizens."
"I would like to comment on three specific points in the report."
"Firstly, I think that the cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Commission has developed well in recent years."
"As pointed out in the report, the Commission uses a new internal procedure empowering each Commissioner to adopt and transmit communications to the Ombudsman."
"I am happy that both the Ombudsman and Mr Schwab welcome this innovation in their reports."
"In addition, the Commission has adapted its internal rules to speed up the handling of its replies to the Ombudsman."
"The Commission will continue to develop its cooperation with the Ombudsman."
"The rapporteur suggests that a similar empowering procedure be introduced for the handling of petitions."
"While the Commission will continue to work closely with the Committee on Petitions, that is not a possibility that the Commission envisages."
"The Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman have distinct roles, each with its own value to citizens."
"Secondly, the report mentions the Europa website."
"It is one of the most visited websites in the world and it has become quite complex to navigate."
"It is in that light that the Commission is well on its way towards refurbishing its own part of the Europa portal."
"The ultimate objective is to transform the Europa website into a more user-friendly, well-structured and coherent web portal."
"It will be multilingual at appropriate levels and the presentation will be more oriented to citizens and communication."
"Thirdly, and finally, the decision to revise the Ombudsman's statute rests with the European Parliament, with the approval of the Council."
"The Commission is, however, consulted and closely follows developments relating to the proposal, including those in the committees concerned."
"The Commission is currently examining the proposal in detail, and has been in contact with the Ombudsman's office to seek clarification on some aspects of the proposal."
"In conclusion, I understand that next year the Ombudsman intends to include a few star cases in his annual report."
"These are, as I understand it, cases where the handling of complaints by the EU institutions has been exemplary, regardless of whether maladministration occurred."
"I think that is an excellent initiative and I also look forward to seeing next year's report."
"Mr President, Madam Wallström, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, my honourable friend Andreas Schwab, on the extraordinary effort he has made in his report to illustrate that, year on year, the institution of the European Ombudsman is becoming extremely important to European citizens, thanks to the work being carried out by the European Ombudsman."
"I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Diamandouros, because the new facts that he brings to light in the position he holds are reference points for the trust that the citizens place in the institutions."
"I acted as rapporteur for the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2004 and I wish to point out that, compared with that year, during which complaints rose by 53% over the previous year, in 2005 the Ombudsman received a total of 3 920 complaints, in other words an increase in the order of 5%."
"This does not mean that there are more cases of maladministration on the part of the institutions of the European Union, but that the citizens are more informed as to their rights."
"An important factor for the efficacy of the institution of the Ombudsman is its cooperation with the institutions of the European Union."
"I would refer by way of example to the regular updates and meetings between Mr Diamandouros and the Committee on Petitions and its bureau."
"The Ombudsman's annual report illustrates, among other things, the efforts being made by the Ombudsman and the Commission, of course, to broaden and further strengthen the network of national and regional ombudsmen, by developing exchanges of information for best practices."
"The participation of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament in this network is important and would facilitate practical cooperation between the European institutions and the national and regional ombudsmen and would allow regular contacts with the committees on petitions of the national parliaments and with the ombudsmen of the Member States to be increased."
"If we compare the Ombudsman's reports for 2004 and 2005, we see that the result was positive, so that we can concentrate on the points in which the Committee on Petitions is particularly interested."
"Furthermore, we can see in this way the essential role he plays and the progress made within one year."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - I too want to thank Mr Schwab, and my colleagues in other political groups as well, for the considerable amount of work they have put into this report."
"The Ombudsman's report, particularly the executive summary, is, I believe, an excellent example of how to present our work to the citizens."
"It is clear, concise and to the point."
"Transparency is, I believe, the key to European democracy and its main building block."
"I welcome the increased awareness of the European Ombudsman's role, reflected in the increased numbers taking their complaints to him."
"I am not at all concerned about the fact that many of these are not directly his responsibility."
"That is a reflection of his success in bringing his office to the notice of the public and perhaps also an indication of the inadequacies of other institutions in making clear who they are and how to access them."
"I believe we should not expect citizens to find their way through the maze of EU institutions."
"They have more important things to be doing with their lives."
"When they have a complaint to make, they will reach for the nearest known vehicle available to them."
"I think that the citizen's right to make a complaint is a good thing."
"The action of the Ombudsman in referring those cases for which he does not have direct responsibility to the appropriate institution is an excellent way of dealing with such complaints."
"I believe it should be followed by other institutions."
"One final point: ten years after the initiation of the Ombudsman's statute, there is clearly a need for a review."
"I welcome the Ombudsman's initiative in that regard and I look forward to debating it in Parliament in the near future."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I too should like to thank the Ombudsman both for his report and for his interesting presentation today."
"I would also like to thank Mr Schwab for his very competent report and analysis of the Ombudsman's report."
"There is little to say except that everything seems to be going well in the sense that our citizens are more aware of the Ombudsman's activities."
"If the numbers of complaints are rising owing to an increasing awareness of what is possible and an awareness of Europe, then that is helping to bring our citizens closer to us."
"That is what we should be all about. Reports of this type help give us a snapshot of what is going on and of how we can do things better in the future, and this report sets out many of those lessons."
"I want to centre my remarks on an issue already mentioned by other speakers, which is that if we want to be citizen-centred then we have to ensure that our citizens can make a complaint easily, perhaps via a one-stop shop."
"Simply having a good website may not be the answer."
"At present there are a lot of people dealing with complaints, problems and issues."
"We have the Ombudsman's very good service, Parliament's Committee on Petitions, the Commission itself, which accepts complaints, and ourselves as MEPs, who receive constituents' case-work, as well as SOLVIT and EUROJUST."
"I fear that some EU citizens who apply to one of these bodies only to be referred to another will fall by the wayside and give up."
"We need to think about ways in which we can bring these various strands together so that our citizens feel that their issues are being answered promptly and that they are being directed to the right recipient."
"That is something we should think about for the future."
"Thank you again for your report."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the Ombudsman and also Mr Schwab, for his thorough, complete and positive report."
"I would like to begin by expressing my agreement with Mrs Wallis's proposal and with the proposal for a European one-stop shop for the citizens' complaints."
"This one-stop shop could bring together SOLVIT, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions and would be responsible for channelling the citizens' complaints to the appropriate institution."
"We cannot expect the public to be able to navigate such a complicated labyrinth as the European Union."
"My only regret about the report, which in general is very positive, is its consideration of the third special report by the Ombudsman, which was going to be a report on OLAF and which has been blocked by the Conference of Presidents."
"Some of the wording of the Schwab report appears to legitimise this House's Conference of Presidents' attempts to hinder the Ombudsman's work of monitoring European bodies, including OLAF."
"In particular we should thank the Ombudsman for some of his efforts, such as those relating to the environment, where there is great popular concern."
"I would especially like to mention the case of the industrial port of Granadilla, in the Canary Islands, where the Ombudsman has tried to ensure more rigorous application of the Habitat Directive, with a degree of success."
"It is also important to highlight the special report on the transparency of the Council when acting as legislator, a report that I personally was involved in preparing."
"We can see that there is slow, gradual, but real progress in this area."
"I would like to end by making it clear that the role of Parliament's Committee on Petitions in no way clashes with the role of the Ombudsman, but rather their roles are complementary."
"The Ombudsman monitors the European institutions in their day-to-day work, while the Committee on Petitions plays the role of direct intermediary between the citizens and the body of Community law."
"There should be more fluid day-to-day cooperation between them, with more information and more contact."
"Thank you for your report, Mr Schwab, and thank you, Mr Diamandouros, for your very intensive, wide-ranging and important work."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, I too would like to thank the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, and our rapporteur, Mr Schwab, because they are both working to try to improve the way we respond to the European citizens' complaints, administrative or of any other kind."
"In fact, I believe that the time has come to take concrete initiatives to make such improvements."
"Some interesting ones have already been mentioned, such as the online form and the better demarcation of the competences of the different bodies, but I believe that we should be rather more ambitious."
"We should move toward a code of good administrative conduct for all of the European institutions, and the one-stop shop, which Mr Hammerstein mentioned, can also be important."
"The reports note that 24% of complaints relate to a lack of transparency."
"I believe that we must make an effort to promote a public debate in Europe on how close a relationship citizens have with the institutions and to ensure that those institutions act in an entirely transparent fashion."
"In this regard, I would like to mention another problem that the members of the Committee on Petitions should resolve."
"Many of the citizens' complaints received relate to large works, large infrastructures, that are carried out in the European Union without the mandatory environmental impact study."
"Sometimes the European Commission is late in issuing a report, since the damage caused by certain absolutely monumental works is already irreversible."
"I believe that the European Commission must act much more quickly, in order to prevent that damage from having an horrendous environmental impact."
"To this end, I believe that we should all do our bit to create speedy assessment mechanisms for these kinds of works, in order to prevent that damage."
"I believe that the European Network of Ombudsmen is important, because it may be the key to providing many solutions that can prevent complaints from the citizens of Europe and, where necessary, improve the way we respond to them."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am, in a sense, wearing two hats today."
"As you said, I am speaking on behalf of the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group as well as in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, which makes me particularly qualified to speak on this matter."
"I would, of course, like to thank Mr Schwab for his report, which was very well prepared and subsequently adopted in our committee, and I therefore fully agree with everything Mr Schwab has said."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Diamandouros."
"He does his job extremely well and this is fully appreciated as, if I may remind you, he has been re-elected to his post by a majority of over ninety percent of the votes cast."
"I very much appreciate the contact that Mr Diamandouros has with the European public, outside of his main work as Ombudsman."
"He has attended over 170 meetings."
"I myself was present at one of these meetings in Poland, which was attended by over 150 people who had come to see who he was, what he had to say and what message the European Ombudsman himself had for them."
"This is one of the achievements of Mr Diamandouros' hands-on approach."
"As everyone has already mentioned, I would like to say that the active involvement of the European Ombudsman is closely linked to, shapes and reflects a greater awareness of the rights of the European Union citizens, and that they are more aware of these rights precisely thanks to the activities of the European Ombudsman."
"The Committee on Petitions, of which I am the chairman, works closely with the European Ombudsman."
"We have similar competences, but they are not identical."
"It is therefore important to be aware of the differences between the competences of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions."
"If the President will allow me to extend my speech by a few more seconds, I would like to draw your attention to one more matter."
"The Committee on Petitions is a European Parliament body."
"It is therefore very regrettable that the European Parliament and its bodies sometimes bypass our committee in their dealings with the Ombudsman."
"There was an instance of this on 15 March 2006, when the European Parliament signed a new agreement with the Ombudsman over the heads of the committee which I chair, and which was not involved in this process."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Ombudsman's 2005 report indicates that a growing number of citizens are dissatisfied with the European Union's bodies."
"There is a striking lack of transparency concerning their activities and a lack of effective control over the way we spend our money."
"The infringement of citizens' right to information is particularly damaging."
"A glaring example of this was the campaign to promote the so-called Constitution for Europe."
"In March of last year I addressed a complaint to the European Ombudsman regarding the use of EUR 8 million to promote the European Constitution."
"This funding was only available to supporters of the Constitution."
"This fact was confirmed by a European Commission spokesman on 16 February 2005."
"In response to questions from the media on whether European Union money could be used to fund a campaign organised by opponents of the European Constitution, he said, and I quote: 'The Commission is treating the European Constitution like its baby and cares about its ratification' and the 'European Union's Office for Official Publications is not going to print pamphlets written by opponents of the Constitution.'"
"These frank statements by Commissioner Wallström's spokesman explicitly show that opponents of the Constitution did not, and still do not, have any opportunity to present their views."
"For example, before the referendum in Spain, the European Commission spent EUR 1 million on printing 5 million pro-constitutional pamphlets and stickers, which were handed out in public places."
"There was a deliberate move to avoid providing information on the negative aspects of the European Constitution."
"This was therefore a blatant infringement of the European citizens' fundamental right to equal access to information."
"After investigating my complaint for a year, the European Ombudsman decided that the European Commission did not infringe the citizens' right to equal access to information."
"In that case, who did?"
"When they see their credibility collapsing and disintegrating, the European Union institutions resort ever more frequently to mendacious propaganda and to funding and imposing a single, 'true' vision of European unity."
"I appreciate the Ombudsman's efforts in the fight to achieve transparency concerning the work of the European institutions, but there is still a long way to go."
"Dinners with representatives of the bodies the Ombudsman are investigating are not enough to increase the credibility and authority of his office."
"This office should be a real Ombudsman defending our rights, an Ombudsman who speaks out for the truth and defends the citizens from the ills of the European Union machine."
"However, such work requires courage and autonomy."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Schwab."
"He has produced a jolly good report and I am delighted to be part of it."
"The Ombudsman has been signally successful in his activities, but ironically his success has provoked more interest."
"That, however, is actually good news for the task of the Committee on Petitions, to which the Ombudsman reports and whose joint work with him is so important."
"I agree entirely with Diana Wallis that is essential that EU citizens are made more aware of the facilities for the redress of grievances, particularly those that exist through the auspices of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions."
"I, with everyone else, congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his achievements, especially, if I may say so, on his determination, past, present and future, in explaining the use of his powers to the new Member States and encouraging them to use his services."
"We have plans to do the same on behalf of the Committee on Petitions and I should say that the combination of a Commissioner from Sweden, where the Ombudsman originated, and an Ombudsman from Greece, where democracy originated, is a powerful and influential one."
"I am particularly interested in the Ombudsman's special reports."
"He will know that I am the rapporteur manqué for one such report, relating to OLAF."
"He must know, as must this House, that I will not allow this issue to go away."
"Transparency and open dealing must be paramount and this report must and will be dealt with when the judicial process is completed."
"As the chairman said, the Committee on Petitions is of increasing importance and must soon cease to be the Cinderella committee at the end of the list of limited significance."
"The activities of the Ombudsman and the Petitions Committee are many, various and growing exponentially."
"They must be recognised by Parliament and the Conference of Presidents and given the authority they deserve."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Diamandouros on his detailed report, which proposes a way forward and improvements in the relationship between the citizens and the European Administration."
"I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Wallström and thank her for her tireless efforts to facilitate communications between the citizen and the European institutions and implement quick, simpler and interactive solutions."
"I would also, of course, like to congratulate Mr Schwab in particular on the in-depth way in which he has dealt with these issues, which may seem routine but which certainly represent progress on the road towards 'more Europe'."
"I am particularly pleased with the progress in the work of mediation and response to the citizens' demands and I am particularly pleased and interested to note the friendly solutions proposed."
"I would also urge Mr Diamandouros to develop a format for the peaceful settlement of disputes that serves as a model for Europe in general."
"I am sure that the democracy enjoyed by both the Administration and the citizens will be increased by means of a better and more transparent administration."
"I am also delighted with the explicit proposal to offer the Internet sites for all of the institutions in all of the Union's official languages."
"Given his constructive approach, I share Mr Schwab's concern about the need to improve cooperation, with no obstacles or misunderstandings, between Parliament and the European Ombudsman, while preventing any overlapping between them: the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman are still seeking their own directions, and it is therefore positive that the Committee on Petitions should participate in the European Network of Ombudsmen."
"Finally, perhaps because I am not aware of the scale of the issue, I am rather concerned that the future of the Ombudsman appears to lie in the courts, and I hope that that does not mean that improving information and, particularly, the efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement of disputes will be abandoned early."
"The proposed judicialisation is not the best way to improve relations between the citizens and the European public Administration, and I would refer to the existing examples that have already been mentioned."
"I truly believe that the European citizens' confidence in their Ombudsman will depend on a greater capacity to settle disputes peacefully."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Diamandouros for his report, and Mr Schwab for the report we are debating today."
"I share his concerns that it is a little late in the day to be debating this issue, but I suppose it is better late than never!"
"The Ombudsman is the watchdog of the system."
"I would prefer to think of him as a Rottweiler, which is what we need, rather than a tamer breed!"
"My Irish colleagues will giggle at the 'Rottweiler' description because politically speaking we have one of those in our national parliament."
"The Ombudsman has an important role to play and I do not share the concerns of those who maintain that 70% of complaints fall outside his remit."
"As others have said, this reflects the fact that there is a huge amount of frustration and people need somewhere to turn."
"It is important to underline that."
"I am pleased that the Ombudsman, in his wisdom, does not turn them away, but actually assists them."
"He should continue to do that. Others might not agree, but that is part of his job, and we need that flexibility."
"I compliment the Ombudsman for trying to promote his work."
"There is an onus on all of us in this House to help him in that regard, even if I regard my own office - and I think other colleagues feel similarly - as a one-stop shop."
"At the end of the day, I hope MEPs are the first port of call for citizens who have problems."
"Mrs Wallis' proposal to set up a one-stop shop is a good one, but let us not forget that we as elected representatives are also here to obtain information for citizens."
"The Ombudsman should bear in mind that we in this House often experience as much frustration as the public when it comes to getting information from the Commission."
"There is a duty on administrators to see themselves as servants of the public and not as protectors of the system."
"If necessary, we will have to train people and change their culture."
"I would be interested to know whether the Ombudsman has looked into the attitudes of those who are at the root of problems."
"In other words, in the complaints he has upheld, is a bad attitude evident among administrators?"
"If so, we should do something about that."
"I wish to thank all those involved again, and I hope the Ombudsman's workload increases exponentially, as it should."
"(NL) Mr President, the European Ombudsman's annual report reveals that a quarter of complaints come from citizens who experience a lack of transparency on the part of the European institutions."
"Whilst these complaints are not always justified, of course - as is also mentioned in this extensive report - this is still a large proportion, and so there is much room for improvement."
"The rapporteur is right to point out that, according to the Treaty of Nice, every European institution must seek to be as open and accessible as possible."
"The bulk of the complaints are directed at the Commission, of course, because they are most closely involved with the citizens, although it is in actual fact mainly the Council of Ministers that is causing the delays."
"In the old-fashioned culture of paternalistic power and the top-down approach, openness can wait."
"Nevertheless, confidence is a key condition if policy is to be effective, and the world needs a strong EU that is carried by its citizens, because there is more at stake than a little governing."
"Would Europe want to stand up for globalisation of a different kind, social, sustainable and fair development?"
"Only if Europe commits to this can the EU truly gain confidence."
"Only a Europe, though, that offers openness in every decision will be given it."
"If we want to boost Europeans' confidence in their own European Union permanently, openness and accessibility are absolute political priorities."
"I would urge Europe to throw the doors open wide."
"(DE) Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to comment on what my esteemed colleague Mrs McGuinness said."
"The Rottweiler dogs to which she referred come from the town in which I was born, and so I regard myself as a Rottweiler."
"If I can assist you, Mr Diamandouros, in Rottweiler-like fashion, I shall be very happy to do so."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Diamandouros, Mr Schwab, I would particularly like to thank the latter two of you for the splendid work that has been done, and to express the hope that Mr Schwab can continue to have as firm a bite - not least where politics are concerned - as the well-known breed of dogs from his home town of Rottweil."
"In any case, I wish him every success in that."
"You, too, Mr Diamandouros, have an important part to play, particularly since you are, in my view, the relay that connects the public to the European institutions; it is to you that citizens turn with any concerns they may have with them, and your role is to settle grievances and you do try to find solutions."
"Last year saw 3 920 submissions made, and in 75% of cases, it proved possible to offer the complainants a solution by setting investigations in motion or referring them onward to the relevant departments; that really is a very high percentage."
"The Commission, too, has a very important part to play in this, in that it keeps on trying, by means of various transparency initiatives, to demonstrate how open it is, and I can do no other than encourage it in that, and you, Madam Vice-President, in carrying on down this road."
"The fact is that, as we know, great institutions - not only the Commission, but also those in the business world - have a tendency to become self-sufficient and to acquire a life of their own into which it is difficult for outsiders to get an insight, so press on with your transparency initiative, I beg you."
"What I would like to say to our Polish friend is that I think it extremely hypocritical to accuse the Commission of providing only such information on the constitutional treaty as shows it in a favourable light."
"The publications I have seen were all kept relatively objective and were a necessary means of informing the public as to what this is all about."
"(Applause)"
"It really is hypocritical to demand, on the one hand, more information, and, on the other, to ask that some of it be curtailed."
"That is why we must press on together down this road in order to be able to build a Europe in which we can all share."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, the 2005 report allows us to conclude that the European Ombudsman is successfully achieving the aims of increasing the effectiveness of his institution in the field of good administrative practice and adherence to the principles of the rule of law and human rights."
"At this point, we should say a word of thanks to Professor Diamandouros, who is in charge of this institution."
"The public nature of the Ombudsman's activities deserves praise."
"Nevertheless, it is worrying that 70% of all complaints lodged still remain outside of the scope of competence of the Ombudsman."
"This is nearly always a result of the fact that the essence of the complaints are not directed against the bodies or institutions of the European Union."
"It shows that the division of competences between the institutions and the decision-making processes are still unclear to many European Union citizens."
"It is therefore vital to define and clearly delineate the role of the Ombudsman and the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions in a way that is clear to the citizens of the European Union."
"Last year, the number of complaints rose by 5% over the previous year."
"This may reflect the fact that the Ombudsman's activities are more widely acknowledged, or it may be linked to the fact that not all European Member States have this type of institution, which means that many people go to the European Ombudsman with problems involving national, regional and local administrative bodies."
"The Ombudsman must increase its efforts to provide the public with reliable information."
"Citizens must have easy access to information in their own mother tongues."
"This will allow them to feel that they are card-carrying citizens of the European Union, whose welfare is important and whose voices count."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, on an excellent report."
"I think that he will continue in his role as a watchdog, or indeed a rottweiler, of the law."
"(EL) Mr President, eleven months after the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the institution of the European Ombudsman, the annual report for the 10th year is being approved today."
"I congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his worthy representation and effective conduct of the role of defender of transparency and honest administration in the European Union."
"Perhaps next year we shall examine his annual report in Parliament earlier and more quickly and the Committee on Petitions, as the competent committee, will be in direct contact with the Ombudsman, so that it can be informed about the procedure for the signing of interinstitutional agreements between him and the European Parliament."
"Paragraph 6 of the Schwab report justifiably expresses our regret about the signing of a new agreement with effect from 1 April 2006, in other words before the report for 2005 had been approved."
"The Ombudsman also submitted on 11 July a proposal for the adaptation of his statute. Paragraph 13 of the Schwab report welcomes the fact."
"However, I should like to comment that the issues which he touches on in his request are particularly sensitive and his arguments are particularly weak."
"The ban on intervention in cases pending before the courts is something which cannot be contested on the basis of the Treaties."
"Community servants must be bound by professional secrecy."
"We have competent institutions for examining human rights; but we too, as a parliament controlled by the citizens, have the jurisdiction to investigate and file complaints."
"There is a plethora of extrajudicial procedures."
"The Ombudsman has numerous duties and one can only hope that he has time with the staff in his department, which fortunately is constantly increasing - from 38 to 51 and 57 in 2006 - to respond to the increased number of complaints."
"If, however, the Ombudsman condemns the lack of transparency in the work of the Council, we call on him in Amendment 1 - which I call on you to support - to check, not after specific complaints from citizens, but on his own initiative, the transparency with which EPSO recruitment competitions are carried out and the recruitment methods of the European agencies, including his own department."
"This is an issue which touches on the sensitivity mainly of the new Europeans, who take part in competitions and interviews in their thousands and do not have the right to find out why they failed."
"My thanks also to the Commissioner for highlighting the intention of the Ombudsman to use his time praising the Commission."
"Ombudsman."
"Mr President, I should like to thank very warmly all the Members of this august House for their very encouraging words."
"I take heart from the support I have from this particular body, whose cooperation I value enormously. I also commit myself and my staff to trying to move forward, to doing more of the same and to doing more of what I am asked to do."
"It is not possible for me to cover all the remarks that have been made, but let me address some of the issues."
"Firstly, I am very grateful for the support I have received concerning the Statute."
"With the permission of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I would like to clarify two points concerning this, which I will do in Greek, since she addressed me in Greek."
"(EL) Mr President, Mrs Panayotopoulos, I wish to assure you that the European Personnel Selection Office is already within the European Ombudsman's mandate and that this is a matter of particular concern to us, which we are monitoring very, very closely."
"As far as my recommendations are concerned, I also wish to assure you that the request I make ..."
"(The speaker was cut off by the President, who drew his attention to a problem with the interpretation)"
"I apologise, Mr President."
"I did not realise there was a problem with the interpretation."
"I thought it was an attempt to test my ability to speak in my native tongue!"
"With the President's permission I would like very briefly to assure Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou and the House that the European Personnel Selection Office is already within the Ombudsman's mandate and we devote a great deal of time to questions concerning recruitment."
"On the Statute, I want to make it absolutely plain that the Ombudsman is not, under any circumstances, asking for the right to initiate cases before the Court."
"That is clearly not for us to do."
"The Court and the Ombudsman are separate."
"What we are asking for is the right to intervene before the Court, as that right has been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor in cases of major violations of fundamental rights."
"That is a fundamental difference."
"I repeat, we are under no circumstances seeking to have access to the Court in a way that would in fact go beyond my mandate."
"I appreciate the encouragement concerning a Single Code and I am working with Commissioner Wallström to see whether that would be possible; she referred to that in her own remarks."
"I wish to thank Sir Robert Atkins in particular for his determination to see that all the special reports submitted to this House by the Ombudsman will be dealt with eventually."
"I hope that will be done."
"The one-stop shop idea is a very important one."
"I would very much look forward to working with Mrs Wallström and with other institutions and perhaps launching a brainstorming and reflection procedure about that idea, so that we can serve citizens better."
"I want to stress that the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are complementary organisations;"
"I am very grateful to that committee and we will work with it constantly with a view to moving forward."
"Lastly, I have a few comments to make if I may."
"The inadmissibles are indeed very important and we shall try to reduce them."
"But we will continue to help all citizens who come to us for the wrong reason by using the Network of Ombudsmen of the European Union as a mechanism of transferring complaints to them, thereby helping those citizens and in a sense trying to apply subsidiarity in non-judicial mechanisms."
"We work with our colleagues at national and regional level to serve citizens better, which includes the transfer of inadmissibles."
"I thank Mrs McGuinness very much for her very laudatory remarks."
"I view myself as an external mechanism of control over the administration and therefore, if everything else fails, yes, I will also have to act as a Rottweiler."
"Leaving aside the Irish overtones of that - I do not want to get into theological implications here, or divinity - I think that is, however, the ultimate step."
"The first step, on which I am working very closely with the Commission, with the Secretary-General of the Commission and with Mrs Wallström, is to reach out to the institutions, to reach out to the Commission, and help them understand what their obligations are."
"It is indeed to help them realise that a change of culture is extraordinarily important if the European institutions, including the Commission, are in fact to understand that the institutions exist to serve the citizen and not the other way round."
"Thank you very much for giving me the time to make these clarifications."
"Once again, I want to thank this House for its very encouraging and very warm reactions to my report."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place today at 12.00."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(HU) I wish to draw attention to a matter concerning Mr Diamandouros's report on his activities in 2005, on which the European Parliament has already adopted a resolution this year."
"In 2005, the European Ombudsman submitted a special report to Parliament, because he had found an unjustified discrimination with regard to funds for members of EU staff with children with special educational needs."
"In his draft recommendation, he asked the European Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that parents, whose children are excluded from the European Schools because of their degree of disability, should not be required to contribute to the educational costs of their children."
"Parliament's resolution on the matter requested that the Commission respect the principle of equal treatment."
"The necessary steps were not taken, however, since unfortunately in the course of school enrolment this autumn, it once again happened that a pupil with special educational needs was refused admission."
"This practice, which violates respect for human rights, has led to several families living apart and having to leave Brussels, and often the European institutions as well."
"As laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the EU Treaty, the right to education, equal treatment and the prohibition against any form of discrimination constitute the founding principles of Community law."
"I therefore request that, having regard to the Ombudsman's recommendation and Parliament's resolution on this matter, the European Commission create the conditions for equal educational opportunities for children with special educational needs, in line with European principles."
"Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes"
"Statement by the President"
"I wish to make an announcement to my honourable friends."
"It was with huge relief that we heard the news that the death penalty on Mr Mirza-Tahir Hussain, a British subject detained in Pakistan, has been commuted."
"The President of the European Parliament and the Members of the House made huge efforts to save Mr Mirza-Tahir Hussain's life."
"In this particular case, we are all in a position to welcome the fact that the message sent by Parliament was heard."

"(For outcome and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. In supporting this joint Resolution I want to highlight the demand that the EU must now use all the instruments at its disposal, including the EU association agreement with Israel, to end the violence in Gaza which has condemned the Palestinians to a slow death and risks setting the whole Middle East on fire."
"Israel, as a democratic state, needs to ask itself questions."
"Lawlessness cannot be allowed to be the answer to lawlessness."
"The Israeli government must end its blockade of Gaza and there must be an immediate resumption of aid to Palestine, and support for the government of national unity."
"I support the call for an international inquiry into the possible use by Israeli forces of weapons of mass destruction, as was suspected in Lebanon."
"I also support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East, including Syria and Iran."
"I demand an international force in Gaza."
"We have contributed to the chaos in Palestine and we have allowed the Israelis to go too far in the name of their legitimate right to protect their security."
"We now have mistakes to make up for."
"in writing. - (PT) I wish to state that I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Gaza."
"I did so not because I do not consider the military excesses that have struck at civilian populations to deserve condemnation, but because I feel that the overall content of the statement includes some highly negative terms for the State of Israel, which has been the victim of constant terrorist attacks. That is in no way justifiable."
"in writing. - (PT) Israel is escalating its aggression against the Palestinian people with impunity, as shown by the Beit Hanun massacre and the criminal, inhuman blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been turned into a vast concentration camp."
"In view of that, the European Parliament - while dodging the issue of having endorsed EU participation in the financial blockade of the Palestinian Authority - condemns the Israeli army for the massacre it committed and for its action, which it terms 'disproportionate'."
"Faced with glaring evidence of Israel's brutal aggression against the Palestinian people, Parliament merely 'notes' the disgraceful US veto of a draft resolution in the UN Security Council repudiating Israeli aggression, when actually it should be denouncing US complicity with and responsibility for the attacks and crimes perpetrated in the Middle East, specifically by Israel."
"Rather than proposing the presence of foreign troops in Gaza and the West Bank, which might just help maintain the status quo, what is required is condemnation of Israel over its colonialist policy, the construction of the illegal wall, the systematic repression of the Palestinian people, the destruction of infrastructure, and all the obstacles it places in the way to prevent the legitimate Palestinian Authority from working and to stop the creation of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state, with its capital in Jerusalem."
"in writing. (IT) On behalf of the Transnational Radical Party, I voted wholeheartedly against the resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip (just as I would have done on any of the proposals of the various 'groups'), believing all the resolutions put forward to be inadequate to solve the structural problems of the Middle East."
"I do not think that the European common position on the longest-running conflict in the Middle East can continue to be the old policy of 'two peoples, two states'."
"As the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations has pointed out, every civilian victim of the attacks by Israeli forces is a tragic error, experienced as such by Israeli democratic society, while every Israeli killed by the rockets and suicide bombers of Hamas or Hezbollah is hailed as a triumph over Israel, which is looked upon as a tumour to be eradicated from the Middle East."
"In reality, Mr President, the viable and urgent European alternative for building peace between Israel and the Palestinians (and in the Middle East) is this: two peoples, two democracies."
"This is because only by proposing democratic reforms and the anti-nationalist European federalist model to the Mediterranean as a whole will it be possible to eradicate the structural causes of the Middle East conflict, causes which are very similar to those of all the wars which have devastated our continent, until the decision is made to renounce national sovereignty as an absolute value."
"in writing. - (PT) The solution to the Middle East conflict depends on our upholding peace and mutual recognition and rejecting violence, terrorism and gratuitous military action, as well as accepting that a democratic state has the right to exist and to defend itself."
"This resolution does not do that."
"It is disproportionate when it should be reasonable, and blind when it should be clear-sighted."
"We cannot regard the terrorist attacks on Israel as the acts of 'combatants' and then accuse Israel of massacres."
"This Parliament should not be lecturing a democratic government about its composition, when it merely asks elected but by no means democratic governments to do the bare minimum in recognising Israel."
"That requirement, by the way, is not even mentioned here. Furthermore, I will not be associated with a resolution that seems to conclude that the United States is the reason why the conflict is still going on, and which rather unsubtly threatens to call the association agreement with Israel into question just as an association agreement with Syria is about to be approved."
"The sincere solidarity shown towards the victims and the refusal to accept that the attack on Beit Hanun should go unpunished cannot make me forget the need for balance or make me support a resolution that is disproportionate and counter-productive."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against this resolution on Gaza."
"This is not in any way to minimise the tragedy of Beit Hanoun, where misdirected Israeli artillery fire claimed 19 Palestinian lives."
"The mistake had tragic consequences, and it is right that we should condemn it."
"The tragedy, however, does not entitle us to adopt a resolution that is the most unbalanced I have seen in my seven years in this Parliament."
"I cannot possibly enumerate all the partisan and contentious points in the text of this draft."
"In general terms, it is a one-sided indictment of Israel."
"Paragraph 4 just about manages a reference to the country's inalienable right to security."
"The Qassam rockets that rain down daily on Israeli towns, on the other hand, do not merit a single mention."
"No more than three words are devoted to Gilad Shalit, who has now been in the hands of kidnappers for three months."
"This brief reference, moreover, is hidden away at the very end of paragraph 19, with no mention of his comrades who have been kidnapped in Lebanon."
"Some comments made during the debate, indeed, were despicable, such as the reference to an Israeli society 'hypnotised by rudeness and racism', or the talk of Palestinian deaths counting less than Israeli deaths."
"It seems that anything goes nowadays, and the boundary between anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic rhetoric is overstepped without anyone batting an eyelid."
"This is unacceptable."
"in writing. (SV) In today's resolution on the situation in Gaza, which I have voted in favour of, I would like to have seen a more balanced discussion of the reasons why Israel and its army have been compelled to use methods that, viewed on their own, can be regarded as unreasonable."
"The right of a country to protect its own citizens is a fundamental one, and it is the whole picture, and not individual events, on which judgments must be made."
"in writing. Britain is in the forefront of research into defences against biological and toxin weapons and Britain must have continue to have freedom of action and independence in these matters."
"We deplore the use of weapons against civilian populations and fully support the existing Geneva Conventions, including the Fourth Convention, which already provides legal protection for civilians in time of war and has been ratified by 194 countries."
"in writing. I support the demand that next week's Sixth Review Conference should reconfirm the commitment of all 155 States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning an entire category of weapons and their commitment to the complete prohibition of biological weapons."
"There must be a thorough review of the operation of the BTWC to identify, discuss and agree on how to further strengthen the Convention and achieve a ban on biological and toxin weapons that is a universally binding rule of international law."
"The EU must take up this issue in the transatlantic forums, in particular NATO, to convince the US Administration to move away from its unilateral standpoint and to contribute to the relaunch of an enhanced multilateral framework."
"I welcome the entry into force this month of the CCW's Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War and hope many more States will sign it and ratify the five Protocols."
"I urge the EU and its Member States to urgently establish protocols on relevant weapons systems and establish a protocol unambiguously banning the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of all types of cluster bombs (fragmentation bombs)."
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party has today decided to join fellow MEPs in voting to support the international campaign for a ban on the use of cluster bombs."
"In addition, we draw attention to the fact that although white phosphorus is a conventional and not a chemical weapon, Britain - but not America - has signed Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons banning the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations."
"Labour accepts the assessment of health consequence from depleted uranium made by Britain's Royal Society and supports further research by the World Health Organisation."
"British troops always deserve the best available equipment to protect themselves, but reports that white phosphorus grenades were used in Iraq have been shown to be wrong, and neither does Britain have any DU stocks in Iraq."
"in writing. The British Conservative Delegation fully supports the BTWC and the international efforts to universalise the Convention and to implement it effectively."
"We are also long-standing and consistent supporters of the ban on anti-personnel landmines (APL) although we do not believe that it is a priority to clear APL from uninhabited and economically unused terrain (for example, parts of the Falkland Islands) provided that areas of possible danger are properly indicated."
"We are also very wary about campaigns to extend the scope of international conventions to include cluster and other munitions."
"We support moves to minimise the negative after-effects of conflict, such as explosive remnants, and to introduce 'smart' (self-destructive, precision-guided, etc.) weapons where appropriate."
"We support a ban on the use of white phosphorus a weapon, but it has other battlefield uses, for example for smokescreen."
"We would certainly not support any action that would put British military personnel at increased risk or deprive the British Armed Forces of essential ordnance."
"Therefore, while we support most of the text of this resolution we are not able to support a sweeping ban on cluster munitions at this stage, or indeed on the use of white phosphorus."
"We therefore voted against the amendments and abstained overall."
"in writing. (SV) We support the Via Baltica highway project, on condition that a sound environmental study is carried out."
"in writing. (SV) The June List welcomes the Baltic Sea being put on the political agenda."
"There are many positive aspects to this report, including the fact that due attention is to be paid to the environmental problems in the region."
"We are also very positively disposed towards paragraph 13, which states that those Member States that wish to do so should have the right to introduce environmental regulations more stringent than those proposed by the EU."
"We do not agree, however, that the EU should fund the Via Baltica highway project."
"It is also proposed that Europol cooperation should be increased."
"We do feel able to support this, provided that it only means that the exchange of information is improved."
"It must not lead to a European arrest warrant or to a given State's police being able to take action in a different State."
"We have supported this report as a whole in today's vote as we have concluded that the positive elements in it outweigh the negative ones."
"in writing. (SV) The primary aim of this report is to stress that the Baltic is a particularly sensitive sea of brackish water."
"Paragraph 13, which grants the Member States the right to more stringent legislation in order to protect the Baltic Sea, and paragraph 11, which requires that environmental impact assessments be carried out for all energy projects, are critical to saving the Baltic Sea."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the report despite the negative points in relation to increased border checks and more unsustainable infrastructure projects in the region."
"in writing. (SV) The report on which we are voting today is a wish list for advocates of a militarised EU state."
"Fortunately, it is only an own-initiative report, but, all the same, it is a clear signal to the other institutions of the EU of the direction that Parliament's majority wants the EU to take."
"The establishment of a standing naval force in the Mediterranean is one of the most preposterous ideas put forward."
"What is more, the majority of the committee advocates the creation of a separate budget heading for military operations, and attempts are also being made to revive the dead draft Constitution."
"As always when the European Parliament gets the chance to give its opinion, there is a desire to give more power to the Members of this House."
"We have also adopted a position on the amendment calling for a coastguard under the aegis of the EU."
"The development described in the report is very disturbing and should be a wake-up call, even for the most inveterate advocates of an EU state."
"In view of the insecure situation with which we are faced nowadays, as a result of the numerous conflicts that are going on around the world, we should instead be asking ourselves whether the establishment of an EU army is the right way to address these problems."
"Whether or not a nation state is to send in troops is something that must always be decided by the national parliaments, and never by a United States of Europe formed from the EU."
"We have therefore voted against this report and most of the amendments to it that have been tabled."
"in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports much of this report, in particular the emphasis on ensuring that ESDP is made more effective, so that it can be used as a tool to help in crisis zones throughout the world."
"We also welcome the support given to greater cooperation between the EU and NATO, building on past experience, and the need for further development of capabilities."
"However, we do not support the provisions in paragraph 52 concerning the establishment of a European Defence Minister, or the establishment of a European standing naval force."
"In addition, we do not support paragraph 44, which recommends military operations be funded centrally from the EU budget."
"Concerning paragraph 51, it is important to remember that we are currently in a period of reflection on the future of the Constitution and to underline that ESDP does not constitute the development of a Security and Defence Union."
"in writing. - (FR) Some of the points in Mr von Wogau's analysis coincide with our views, particularly those concerning the threats to Europe's security, such as terrorism, the vulnerability of our oil supplies and the permeability of our borders."
"In fact, contrary to the assertions of our governments, which have dismantled the systems that used to defend our nations, the world has become more dangerous than it was before the Berlin Wall came down."
"The proposals contained in the report, however, are built on a second illusion, namely the idea that nations can rely on supranational bodies to guarantee their security."
"In actual fact, when the chips are down, a nation always stands alone."
"Today the United States devotes 3.5% of its GDP to defence, compared with the one per cent spent by the 25 Member States of the European Union."
"European harmonisation of defence equipment is certainly necessary, but do not let us dissolve our armed forces into a Eurocorps, in which orders would be given in 21 languages and which, via NATO, would be under US command."
"Let us rather strengthen the defence of each of our countries."
"Only independent nations, conscious of their identity, will make that effort."
"To that end, the soulless and borderless Europe of Brussels must first be replaced by a Europe of sovereign nations."
"in writing. - (PT) The document proposed here has earned my support since it is both realistic about what is desirable and ambitious about what is possible."
"Security is one of the most important issues for European citizens, particularly as regards the risk of threats on European soil, and on that subject the rapporteur has sought to be realistic and to understand the immediacy and nature of the threats and the real danger they pose."
"On the other hand, he has been ambitious in wanting to take a global approach, not just in the military field but also in the areas of technology, information and intelligence."
"We too have to be ambitious as regards the need to promote peace and economic development in third countries, insofar as that is essential for our own security and for a better world, which is a goal that we should be pursuing with just as much commitment."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this agreement, since I agree in essence with its analyses and concerns, even though I neither share nor think it necessary to share all its axioms and conclusions."
"in writing. (SV) The EU's common cooperation on foreign and security matters must not be allowed to become a competitor to NATO."
"It is therefore pleasing to see that the European Parliament has come out clearly in favour of strengthening the transatlantic link and that it is stressing the importance of closer cooperation with NATO."
"The EU does currently have a common foreign and security policy."
"This report, however, represents a step towards a deeper level of cooperation on foreign and security matters through which Sweden could lose its ability to decide on its own foreign and security policy."
"The Member States' own military resources should, in fact, continue to form the basis of this cooperation in future."
"It is regrettable that the report expresses support for the European arrest warrant, which makes it possible for Swedish citizens to be handed over to other EU states without the opportunity of trial in Sweden."
"The report also contains expressions of support for the Constitution."
"The result of all this is that I voted against the report in the final vote despite the fact that I share the goals of the report in terms of strengthening the EU's cooperation with NATO."
"in writing. (SV) We have voted in favour of the report on succession and wills in order for the conflict rules to be clarified."
"However, as an aim of the report is to harmonise laws on succession and wills, we wish to stress emphatically our view that a harmonisation of the substantive law is undesirable and that, under the EC Treaty, this area must be, and indeed remain, a solely national competence."
"in writing. - (FR) In seeking to regulate conflicts of law and jurisdiction regarding succession and wills, the European Parliament has for once refrained from encroaching on areas for which national governments have sole responsibility."
"Succession cases with an international dimension, of which there are 50 000 to 100 000 every year in EU territory, do not actually warrant a new wave of forced standardisation of the provisions of substantive law but only require the harmonisation of the rules of private international law and the creation of a European certificate of succession."
"Accordingly, we subscribe to the second parliamentary recommendation, which is designed merely to standardise the rules governing conflicts of law and jurisdiction."
"This, we believe, is the only approach that will enable the Member States to preserve their own legal systems and their own legal customs and traditions."
"Only then will it be possible to coordinate effectively the national legal systems involved in a given probate case."
"To prevent any conflicts of law in the area of inheritance, it is necessary and sufficient to know for certain, with no room for dispute, which law will apply."
"in writing. (SV) This report would create legal chaos and set differing national legal standards and practice against each other if its ideas were implemented."
"The June List is a committed opponent of common civil and criminal legislation at the EU level."
"The consequences if this proposal were adopted would include Swedish citizens losing their unconditional right to divorce (allowing for the rule on a six-month period of reflection)."
"One example of this is as follows. A married couple with Swedish citizenship take up residence in Malta."
"One of the spouses then moves back to Sweden and petitions a Swedish court for divorce."
"Under current Swedish legislation, that spouse would get a divorce under Swedish law."
"Under this proposal, however, it would instead be Maltese law that applied."
"This could mean that it would simply not be possible to get a divorce, as divorce is prohibited not only in Malta but in a number of other European countries."
"This would therefore mean that Swedish citizens would miss out both on maintenance for their children and on the right to half of the assets owned jointly with their spouses."
"In the June List's opinion, this is entirely unacceptable."
"Legislation in this area is an expression of national, religious and social values."
"The EU must not be allowed to trample all over these values."
"As usual, we are discovering that subsidiarity and pluralism only exist in grand speeches, while the reality is a ruthless drive towards harmonisation."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Gomes report on women in international politics."
"The political desire demonstrated at the Beijing Summit in 1995 and the existing international conventions have indeed helped to make the public and decision-makers aware of the issue of equality at every level of society."
"Nevertheless, these declarations have not had the practical effect of eliminating the non-legal obstacles that continue to prevent women from playing a full part in public life."
"The Member States need to adopt measures aimed at reconciling social, professional and family life, in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I support the creation of a European Institute for Gender Equality aimed at boosting the low numbers of women in politics and at promoting greater female representation in international politics."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency to open up new channels that will allow women to become more involved in peace and security issues, particularly through more equal nominations at the United Nations or within the external delegations of the European Union."
"in writing. The Lisbon Strategy placed gender- sensitive economic policies at the heart of the strategy for growth and competitiveness, but women's full participation in politics is an essential requisite to achieving gender-sensitive economic policies."
"A milestone was reached by the 1995 Beijing Conference in advancing the gender equality agenda."
"Yet, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of the 43 961 members of parliaments worldwide only 16.4% are women."
"The percentage of women elected to the European Parliament ranges from 58% to 0%, with an average slightly above 30%."
"The percentage of women elected to the Member States' national parliaments varies between 45% and 9%."
"This marks a fundamental democratic deficit at European level and in the wider international context."
"I call on Member States to review their national legislation to promote parity and genuine democracy in politics, review their constitution, legislation and practice, enshrine gender equality as a fundamental principle in their constitutions and take measures aiming at the reconciliation of social, family and professional life, in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and the Lisbon Strategy, thereby creating an enabling environment for women's full participation in politics."
"in writing. - (PT) Although this report is about women in international politics and it finds that there is a real problem, it ought not to have skirted around the constraints that prevent women from playing an effective part in political and social life."
"The text contains no reference to the economic and social reasons why women's participation is limited."
"For instance, it refers to the pay gap and the need to share domestic responsibilities with men, but it does not mention the real difficulties, particularly working conditions, over-exploitation, low pay, job insecurity, part-time work, and the lack of social facilities at an affordable price."
"The approach taken to the subject ignores class differences, and includes only what happens in the dominant class."
"Thus there is no explicit reference to economic, employment or social policies."
"As a result, in the measures it puts forward, the report continually proposes something that I find unacceptable: a compulsory quota system with penalties for parties, while ignoring the fact that the problems and constraints that exist include, for instance, the economic and social conditions on the ground and the electoral systems themselves."
"In Portugal, for example, the Socialist Party has approved the quota system but is preparing to throw out the current electoral system, which in practice may lead to fewer women being elected."
"in writing. - (PT) Participation by women in international politics (as well as national politics, the economy and the arts) is a sign of developed, well-balanced societies."
"A world just of men is worse than a world of men and women."
"But that does not mean that, every time a woman is elected, or every time a government is composed of as many women as men, it should in itself be a reason to feel satisfied."
"Women are not just women, contrary to what some of those who support quotas and equal representation seem to think."
"Fortunately, the value of each of these women lies in what she thinks, does, supports and represents."
"I therefore do not consider it reasonable simply to applaud the election of any woman, whoever she might be."
"Similarly, I do not think the desired effect can be achieved by means of quotas and imposing equal representation."
"Balance must be an outcome, not a gesture."
"I can speak quite freely on this subject, because the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) is the only party that has had a woman as parliamentary leader, minister of justice or secretary-general."
"These women deserve my recognition, however, not for symbolic reasons, but on their merits."
"in writing. - (FR) In Germany, Liberia, Chile and, even more recently, in the United States Congress, the appointment of women to key posts has been widely applauded."
"I willingly join in this applause, while hoping that, one day, these female success stories will no longer have a symbolic value, but may become an everyday occurrence."
"It is no longer enough for a female politician to centre her media discourse on the real or supposed male chauvinism of her opponents, as we can see from the sad 'example' provided by the French Socialist Party's internal campaign for the presidential nomination."
"We need to demonstrate a more responsible and less demanding attitude, since equal gender representation is now the accepted approach."
"The UMP delegation in the European Parliament, which consists of nine women and eight men, sets the trend in that regard."
"I hope that we support the aspiration and desire of a new generation of women to get involved in politics."
"However, rather than constantly churning out finicky and sometimes overly radical regulations promoting women, we must have faith in their ability to assert themselves and to project their beliefs at every level - local, national or European - as women, certainly, but also as elected representatives."
"in writing. - (FR) I should like to congratulate Mrs Bauer on this very high-quality report."
"Its unanimous adoption within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs testifies to its quality."
"The report is timely in pointing out that the international trade in human beings affects between 600 000 and 800 000 men, women and children each year."
"Around 80% of these victims are women and 50% are young girls."
"The majority of the victims of this trade are sexually exploited for commercial gain."
"In order to deal with the growth in this form of trafficking and with its increasingly international character, this report proposes a series of integrated measures to be taken at European level, which I feel are equal to the challenges associated with this scourge."
"Above all, it highlights the EU's desire to follow an approach focused on human rights and on the victims, which I feel is crucial."
"For these reasons and because the fight to uphold human dignity deserves our full support, I voted in favour of this text proposing the adoption of a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on fighting trafficking in human beings."
"in writing. - (FR) Bizarrely, this report strives to make a clear distinction between human trafficking and illegal immigration."
"In many cases, however, they are unquestionably similar, because illegal immigration has become part and parcel of genuine human trafficking, the most appalling form of which is carried out for the purposes of sexual exploitation."
"Who are the real culprits, though?"
"Without doubt, they are the smugglers, the drug traffickers, the pimps and other oppressors who take advantage of a European territory that has no internal borders and that is wide open to migratory flows."
"Yet, they are also the national and European leaders, who are taking no serious action to combat illegal entries, mass immigration, sham marriages - or, worse still, are implementing an overtly 'pro-immigration' policy."
"Punishing the smugglers more severely, dismantling the criminal rings, and paving the way for further cooperation among States are undoubtedly objectives that must be attained."
"The placebo effect will not last long, however, because the real difficulty - the lack of controls at the European Union's internal borders - remains."
"If we do not challenge the free movement of non-EU nationals, that veritable dogma spouted by Brussels, then illegal immigration will continue irresistibly to develop."
"in writing. (SV) The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings has already been signed by 30 countries."
"The Convention has been ratified by Moldova and Romania, amongst others, and work on ratification is under way in Sweden."
"The Convention applies to all forms of trafficking in human beings irrespective of whether it is national or international or linked to organised crime."
"The Convention complements, in this way, the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime."
"The June List believes that the EU should respect the national and international agreements already signed by its Member States."
"In our opinion, it is for the democratically elected national parliaments of the respective countries to enter into legally binding treaties."
"We support the struggle against the trafficking of human beings and we congratulate the governments of Romania and Moldova on their courage in having ratified this extremely important Convention."
"We therefore do not see it as necessary for the EU to be calling for ratification."
"The sovereign nations of Europe have already taken up the struggle amongst themselves, without interference from supranational bodies."
"in writing. - (PT) On the whole we welcome the report, although we regret that certain proposed amendments have been adopted that do not help to make the fight against trafficking in human beings, above all women, any more effective."
"We are unhappy at the removal of those paragraphs that referred to the need to 'criminalise the buying of another person's body for sexual use' with the aim of reducing trafficking for sexual purposes."
"As many studies show, banning the exploitation of prostitution substantially decreases organised crime and trafficking, particularly of women and children."
"The report has, however, retained a number of positive points, such as the need to impose extremely severe penalties on companies using cheap labour supplied through human trafficking, or the need for Member States to accept responsibility for the victims of trafficking in human beings, in addition to effectively clamping down on the laundering of the proceeds of the traffic in human beings."
"Even so, the report could have gone further on fighting the problem at source, through a policy of cooperation with the countries of origin, including support for specific economic and social development projects, thus reducing the main causes of trafficking, which are poverty, unemployment and social exclusion."
"in writing. - (FR) This report accomplishes the amazing feat of making an illusory distinction between human trafficking and illegal immigration."
"The fact is that, since the disastrous 1985 Schengen agreements abolishing the European Union's internal border controls, these two phenomena - which no one doubts are closely linked - have developed at an exponential rate."
"Ever since Europe took it upon itself, on behalf of the Member States, to implement 'an area of freedom, security and justice', the criminal gangs, the pimps and the organised smuggling rings have made profits such as they have never made before."
"These networks are multiplying and prospering by exploiting more and more human beings."
"In a bid to find a solution to these human tragedies, the Commission and Parliament are proposing to organise political dialogues among States and to introduce yet more programmes and cooperation plans."
"What is the use in doing that?"
"It is high time we tackled the real causes of human trafficking and illegal immigration: the lack of secure, protected borders in Europe."
"It is true, however, that it is impossible for our Eurocrats to challenge the sacrosanct rule of free movement of persons!"
"Trafficking in human beings is a modern version of the slave trade, but in some respects worse."
"In this case, desperation makes the victims pay to be trafficked, and the authorities, often with the best of humanitarian intentions, may adopt policies that encourage trafficking and help the traffickers do business."
"In this field, as often happens, we have to be cruel to be kind."
"That means being strict with those who provide work, strict with those who arrive, strict with those who stay and, above all, strict and rigorous in enforcing the law."
"Shutting our eyes to illegal immigration is tantamount to aiding and abetting human trafficking."
"I therefore believe that we should unhesitatingly recognise the benefits of legal immigration and, since the lack of a strong hand in fighting illegal immigration merely encourages the networks that traffic human beings, we have to stand firm in upholding legality."
"It is not enough, however, to focus on immigration laws."
"For an effective - and humane - approach, we must try and promote the economic success and development that we enjoy in the migrants' countries of origin."
"That is the direction in which we should all be moving together."
"in writing. - (FR) The figures and estimates concerning human trafficking are frightening."
"Mrs Bauer's report quotes figures of 600 000 to 800 000 men, women and children who are trafficked throughout the world each year."
"This is a form of exploitation that includes, at the very least, not only prostitution, but also forced labour or services, slavery and even organ removal."
"Yet, what the report does not tell us is that there are more and more of these human tragedies, ever since the destructive Schengen agreements abolishing internal border controls were signed in 1985."
"Europe's idea of heaven, the universally longed-for and coveted 'area of security, freedom and justice', proves not to exist in any of the Member States and, worse still, it proves to be dangerous and to be favourable to the development of all kinds of gangs and organised crime."
"As long as our national and European municipal worthies refuse to see that the increase in this international trafficking is due to open borders and that all the policies for combating human trafficking and illegal immigration hinge on the immediate re-establishment of border controls in Europe, the programmes and plans that follow on from one another will be worse than useless."
"in writing. - (PT) This report on a highly controversial Commission communication has ended up enshrining some of the most negative aspects of the methods, particularly propaganda, that are being developed in order to put the project for a so-called European Constitution back on the table."
"After the defeat that Europe's ruling elite suffered in the referendums on the draft Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, they now want to go on as before without any further setbacks by investing as much as possible in a propaganda campaign, transforming a necessary democratic communication policy into a real propaganda campaign serving the interests of the dominant class."
"Although the report also covers other, less controversial topics, such as sectoral programmes aimed at young people in education and the call to intensify parliamentary and other debates, the truth is that its predominant line overall is propaganda, especially about the quality leap that they want to achieve with a so-called European Constitution."
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. - (FR) The aim of the European communication policy is ostensibly to 'counter the effect produced by the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty [...] and to halt the general rise of Euroscepticism'."
"What is at stake, in your opinion?"
"Information on Europe, which is truncated, distorted and exploited by the media and the national political classes."
"What is the solution?"
"A campaign plugging the benefits of the European Union, organised by a Brussels 'Propaganda Staffel'."
"Who is the target?"
"The people of Europe, whose Euroscepticism is directly proportional to their ignorance of the paradise created for them in Brussels, Euroscepticism that must be converted into blind admiration and unconditional support."
"Who are you trying to kid?"
"You have not listened to or understood a thing."
"It is precisely because they were informed, and because they got their information from the source, by reading the text, that the people of France and the Netherlands overwhelmingly rejected the Constitution."
"It is precisely because they live through the economic and social disasters of your policy each day that they are Eurosceptics."
"It is precisely because, for once, they were directly asked their opinion that they took an interest in Europe."
"It is precisely because you have a deep-rooted fear of the people that you prefer brainwashing to direct consultation of these citizens, whom you regard, deep down, as idiots."
"They feel exactly the same way about you."
"in writing. (SV) The EU's communication policy must not be an attempt to sell a United States of Europe to the citizens."
"The institutions of the EU should only put out accurate and factual financial reports and reports on their activities and otherwise provide information on things such as the exchange projects on offer in higher education."
"It is not the case, as seems to be assumed, that the more knowledge a particular voter has, the more he or she becomes a proponent of the construction of an EU superstate."
"People's views on intergovernmental collaboration or supranationalism as forms of cooperation within the EU have their basis in values and not in factual knowledge."
"We further do not believe that Brussels should arrange for top-down initiatives and funding to enable EU parties to engage in dialogue with their constituencies on EU matters."
"The political interest in EU matters must be built from the bottom up through political parties and organisations."
"It is also pointed out in the report that communication is to be based on initiatives promoted through popular communication channels such as cultural programmes (such as through the awarding of literary or film prizes), sporting events and the like. We would again state our view that such methods of marketing the EU are redolent of contempt for Europeans."
"This is not how the EU should inform people of its existence and of what it does."
"in writing. - (PT) While I agree in essence with the positions and concerns of the Commission regarding communication policy, particularly on the need to be transparent and to engage with the people, I still feel that it should be quite clear that a communication policy is not an end in itself, but a means. That is how it should be understood."
"The illusion that everything is communication and that communication is everything may lead us to a society devoid of meaning, in which all that matters is the existence of the message and little is invested in its content."
"What that means, in my view, is that the key to a successful EU communication policy lies in the Union's ability to be seen to be useful to the citizens of the Member States."
"I stress useful, and seen to be useful."
"That is where the two issues - substance and communication - come into play."
"The EU has to promote political reform that stimulates economic development, security, international order and hope."
"That is the substance."
"As for communication, if the substance is good, it is an art, but it is only part of the story, and not the most important part at that."
"In addition, right now, it must not be confused with propaganda."
"I agree with the former, but not the latter."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Agenda for next part session: see Minutes"
"Famagusta/Varosha (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the question put by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the oral response concerning the incorporation of the return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants into the comprehensive measures for ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community-B6-0446/2006)."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, we have been waiting for quite a long time for the oral question on Varosha, in the Famagusta area, to appear on the European Parliament's agenda."
"It so happens that we are debating matters related to the Committee on Petitions for the second time today."
"This morning, our committee presented its report on the European Ombudsman's report."
"I am very pleased that, although we have been waiting for a long time to discuss these two items, they have both been raised on the same day."
"It is with great satisfaction that, since we are describing the Committee on Petitions as a body that is intended to bring the European Union institutions closer to the citizens, we can today discuss a very important petition."
"I am also very pleased that some of the authors of the petition are here in the Chamber, and are sitting in the gallery."
"I am pleased to welcome Mr Afxentiou and Mr Christofidis who, as I have mentioned, are two of the authors of the petition and are listening to the debate today."
"Mr President, the decision to table an oral question was taken in our committee at its meeting on 14 July 2005."
"The authors of the petition, including those who are here today, were also present at that meeting."
"They represent an organisation which is very important in Cyprus, and is called the Famagusta Refugees Movement."
"This movement was created in 1976 by the displaced inhabitants of Famagusta."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament deferred the discussion a number of times."
"This resulted in significant delays to the staging of today's debate."
"In the meantime, the whole problem has taken on even greater urgency."
"The authors of the petition stressed that 30 years have passed since Famagusta was occupied by the Turkish army and the district of the town known as Varosha was closed off."
"When presenting their problems and their petition during our committee meeting, the authors of the petition pointed out that Varosha, which has become a complete ghost town, is causing a great rift between the displaced inhabitants and their descendants."
"It is an obstacle to the general economic revitalisation of the town and is doing nothing to promote better understanding between the communities in Cyprus."
"The authors of the petition propose in particular that Varosha should be returned to its original inhabitants, under regulations to be adopted by the international community, and in particular by the European Union."
"The authors of the petition declare their support for attempts to help Turkish Cypriots who, from a legal and social point of view, form an integral part of Cyprus."
"They also express concerns regarding the regulations which have been implemented, and which favour the Turkish Cypriot community."
"Their concerns relate to the fact that these measures are causing isolation and disassociation from the underlying strategy which aims to reunite Cyprus."
"The authors of the petition stressed that, although this objective is contained in the explanatory statement in the Council regulation, which aims to create a financial aid instrument to foster the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, this package intends to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by supporting economic and social development, focussing particularly on economic integration."
"There has been no consistent policy to achieve these aims."
"For their part, the authors of the petition propose, first and foremost, measures to facilitate the promotion of trade and tourism, which could increase the prosperity of the community and improve its financial situation, as well as making full use of the potential of the port of Famagusta, which would then result in the regeneration of the whole surrounding region."
"The authors of the petition also proposed that part of the European Union funding earmarked for providing support to Turkish Cypriots should be paid into a special fund managed by a non-governmental organisation, in which both communities would be equal stakeholders, under the auspices of the European Union and the supervision of the European Commission."
"They also proposed that these funds should be earmarked for renovating, modernising and making use of the port of Famagusta."
"The Committee on Petitions has, on behalf of the authors, addressed a question to the European Commission asking what instruments the Commission intends to use to ensure that the issues raised by the authors of the petition are resolved."
"On 27 February 2006, the General Affairs Council decided to call on the Commission to undertake further efforts in the field of direct trade for the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot communities, on the basis of negotiations which took place during the Luxembourg presidency, when the matter of the closed area of Varosha and the port was raised, together with matters relating to free trade."
"At the same time, it was also said that this part of Famagusta, Varosha, is not currently being used."
"It is an incredibly painful situation for the displaced inhabitants and their descendants."
"It also makes the economic regeneration of the town difficult and it does nothing to build trust between the Cypriot communities."
"What action, then, does the Commission intend to take in connection with the above-mentioned decision, to ensure that the closed area of Famagusta can be returned to its rightful inhabitants?."
"Mr President, this House has, on numerous occasions, debated issues in this House related to Cyprus, Turkey and the problems caused by the Turkish aggression against Cyprus."
"This petition, and the oral question resulting from it, addresses this very problem, which is a fundamental issue for that part of Europe and has consequences for the whole of the European Union."
"That is why I would be very grateful not only for an answer on this issue, but also to see the proposals put forward by various European bodies, as well as the demands of the authors of the petition, being implemented."
"The matter is important, as the solution will, for Turkish, Greek and Cypriot society at large, serve to indicate how effectively the European bodies can resolve problems related to the hopes of European citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would very much like to request a response and I hope that this response will satisfy the authors of the petitions, as well as the Committee on Petitions and the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Libicki and the Committee on Petitions for raising this question."
"Personal friends I have known for a long time are refugees from Varosha and, therefore, I know the importance of the issue not only because of my portfolio but also because of my personal contacts."
"The United Nations has the responsibility and competences to pursue a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue."
"The Commission supports the United Nations in these efforts and encourages the parties concerned to resume talks on such a settlement."
"The return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants is one of the key elements in the UN-led process."
"If agreed by the parties, the return of Varosha will have to take place under the auspices of the United Nations."
"The Annan Plan foresaw an early return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants."
"However, the plan, supported by the United Nations and the European Union, fell in 2004."
"The return of Varosha is a separate issue from the introduction of direct trade between the Turkish Cypriot Community and the rest of the European Union."
"Direct trade is a matter of EU competence."
"The Commission proposed a draft regulation to this effect in July 2004."
"Successive EU presidencies, in seeking to establish a consensus in the Council on the direct trade regulation, have investigated possible solutions, but without success so far."
"The Finnish Presidency is making substantial diplomatic efforts to unblock the current stalemate and the Commission fully supports the Presidency in its efforts."
"The Finnish formula would create a genuine win-win situation for both communities and all parties concerned."
"It would be a major confidence-building measure towards a comprehensive settlement, thus meaning also a prospect of the return of Varosha."
"Creating a win-win situation has been the essence of European integration since the times of Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer, who united France and Germany just five years after the most bitter and devastating war on earth was fought on their soil."
"Over the past 42 years there has been enough talk of 'red lines' and 'blackmail' in the eastern Mediterranean."
"That is pre-modern talk in today's post-modern Europe."
"It is high time to replace red lines with bridge-building and win-win thinking, because that is what the European Union is all about."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Famagusta question is primarily a humanitarian one."
"That was precisely the basis on which the Famagusta refugee movement presented its petition to the Committee on Petitions."
"For 32 years now, over 30 000 people have dreamt day and night about going back to their homes."
"Thirty-two years is too long."
"The beautiful city of Famagusta is still uninhabited."
"It is a ghost town."
"Turkey cynically insists on keeping it as a bargaining tool."
"Naturally, the question the inhabitants of Famagusta are asking is what the international community is doing, and what the European Union is doing, to help them go back to their homes."
"The Commissioner has said that everybody is trying."
"However, the issue is very simple."
"There is an empty city to be given to its lawful inhabitants."
"There are other bargaining tools for Turkey to use."
"Turkey is not being sent the right message on what should be done."
"The deliberations on Famagusta are the first big step towards a proper solution to the Cyprus problem based on United Nations resolutions and European values."
"Turkey has to take that step now, in the interests of justice, in the interests of Turkey and in the interests of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as Mr Libicki has said."
"The desperate appeal coming from those refugees from Famagusta who are still alive is: 'Help us to go back home'."
"Let us help them, Commissioner."
"Now is the time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most of us are lucky enough to enjoy small luxuries, such as, for example, living in our own home, in a neighbourhood of acquaintances and friends."
"Today, however, we are debating efforts by certain people who belong to the large European family to be able to regain exactly what we consider to be reasonable in our everyday lives."
"The movement of refugees from Famagusta consists of displaced citizens from what has been a ghost town for 32 years."
"These people have, of course, managed to rebuild their lives in Cyprus. Just think, however, what it means to know that your first home or your parents' home lies abandoned and inaccessible a few kilometres away, for reasons for which you are not to blame."
"The return of the town of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants in the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot community will have numerous economic and social benefits."
"Famagusta was a popular tourist destination."
"Its reconstruction can restore it to its former glory, as well as creating huge potential for trade, by making use of its port, which can be reopened as requested, using the latest technologies in order to make the best possible use of it."
"If the town is restored to its residents in a way which safeguards the strengthening of ties between the two communities, with guarantees from the international community and, of course, the European Union during the period of reconstruction and development, reasonable ties will develop between the two communities."
"If an environment of security, certainty and trust is created for economic development and cooperation, as cooperation in employment and the economy develops, social ties will develop alongside it."
"Finally, what is needed is for the town to develop its own momentum, a momentum which will function as an example and precursor."
"I wonder, given that the request comes from the residents of the town themselves and knowing the good ties between people on both sides, if we have the right to refuse, if we have the right not to help."
"Nonetheless, this opportunity should not become a chance for us to blow up progress efforts in Cyprus."
"We shall all have our responsibilities, responsibilities towards the people as well as responsibilities towards posterity."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the taking of hostages by terrorists and their subsequent holding to ransom has not been an uncommon occurrence in recent years."
"It is a despicable act of satanic criminal perversion, and is widely and universally condemned by all those with even the slightest degree of common sense."
"Equally, the taking of a city as hostage by a country which has invaded another and then uses that city to extract political gains by blackmail is a case of psychopathic barbarism of immense magnitude and unintelligible reasoning."
"This is what has happened in the case of Famagusta."
"Up until 1974, Famagusta was a thriving city full of life and vigour, with a rich history going back thousands of years, surrounded by blossoming citrus fruit orchards, lying on a golden sandy coast."
"It was a city of enviable beauty."
"Famagusta was widely regarded by many as the jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean."
"Its peace-loving inhabitants went about their daily lives, working hard to achieve progress and prosperity."
"But in the summer of 1974, all their dreams were shattered."
"After repeated severe and catastrophic air bombardments, the city was overrun by droves of Turkish soldiers, tanks and armoured vehicles, spreading death and destruction in their path."
"In horror, the inhabitants fled, trying desperately to save the lives of their loved ones and carrying with them the bare essentials needed to survive."
"Most of them found refuge on an area of high ground a few kilometres to the south of the city, where they lived in makeshift refugee camps, and from where they watched their homes being looted by Turkish soldiers."
"Apart from furniture and other household effects, the invaders took away doors, windows, pipes, roof tiles and everything else they could lay their hands on."
"Then they fenced off the whole city, declared it a military zone and put guards around it."
"This state of affairs continues today, 33 years later."
"Whenever an inhabitant, driven by homesick desperation, has tried to approach his fenced city, he has been shot dead on the spot or arrested by Turkish soldiers and tried in Turkish military courts on grounds of entering a high security military area."
"The ghost city of Famagusta has many times been the focus of attention in various UN resolutions, and in between the 'ifs' and 'whens' and 'hows' of hazy diplomatic language, the people of Famagusta have tried to believe time and time again that they will return to their homes."
"But this has all been an illusion, because in the real world of political diplomacy it is almost always the strong who have their way."
"In the case of Cyprus, Turkey was, and still is, by far the strongest."
"Just as the refugees from Famagusta were about to become totally disillusioned with the UNs and Security Councils of this world, new hope suddenly emerged in the form of Cyprus' accession to the EU."
"Men, women and children were suddenly uttering words like 'the European acquis communautaire' and 'the principles and values upon which the EU is founded'."
"Many were even convinced that after accession the EU would force Turkey to return Famagusta to its rightful occupants."
"How simple-minded they were."
"Little did they realise that the EU mainly cares about trading in the vast Turkish market and not about the old-fashioned principles of justice and freedom."
"Little did they know that the EU mainly views Turkey as being of close to almighty importance in counteracting the threat of Islamic fundamentalists."
"And so, dear colleagues, we find ourselves today talking, talking and talking about the right of Famagustians to go home."
"Most probably, if Turkey has its way, we shall continue talking about it for a long time to come, while the great EU goes on being proud of its principles and values, and almost everybody will be happy - especially the Turkish Government - apart from the people of Famagusta."
"We will gradually come to terms with their grief at having to watch their city, the jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean, slowly die away under the careful eye of the UN, the Security Council, and now the EU."
"Mr President, the question of the return of the sealed-off area of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants has never formed part of the overall settlement of the Cyprus question, on which the relevant United Nations resolutions have been passed."
"The long-standing decoupling of the return of the town from the overall settlement is one element I want to comment on."
"The second element is that the Commission, in its last progress report on Turkey, emphasised that the application of the protocol is per se a legal obligation which cannot be linked to the status of the Turkish-Cypriot community."
"Consequently, Turkey is wrong to link the matter of the honouring of its commitments to the lifting of the so-called isolation of the Turkish-Cypriots which, insofar as it exists, is due solely and exclusively to the Turkish occupation."
"Circles in the European Union are likewise wrong to accept this link."
"However, if this link is made, the proposal by the Cypriot Government on joint use of the port of Famagusta, under the aegis of the United Nations and with supervision by the European Commission, combined with the return of the lawful inhabitants of the town, may be the turning point which will help overcome the entirely unwelcome impasse that has developed."
"Turkey will be satisfied in its demand for the so-called isolation of Turkish-Cypriots to be lifted."
"The Turkish Cypriots, even though they have absolutely nothing to lose by returning the town which has been deserted for 32 years to its lawful inhabitants, are safeguarding the right to engage in export trade via the port."
"Likewise, all the lawful inhabitants will move back to their town while, at the same time, the Turkish ports and airports will open to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes."
"Finally, the coexistence of the two communities in Famagusta will help efforts to find an overall solution to the Cyprus problem."
"To conclude, the return of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants is the key to addressing current difficulties in a way which serves the well-meant interests of all sides."
"If everyone rises to the occasion and reason prevails, we are quietly optimistic that the complication that has arisen will be addressed with success."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Famagusta is being held hostage."
"It has been described as a ghost town; it is desolate, isolated and empty."
"Famagusta is a city on the east coast of Cyprus."
"In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Famagusta and since then the city has been fenced off."
"At the moment it is unused and is guarded by Turkish troops."
"Nobody lives there."
"Anybody who attempts to enter is shot on the spot or tried in military courts."
"Famagusta only enjoyed independence for 14 years."
"During that time, it was of indispensable benefit to the Cypriot economy."
"It had a population of 60 000 and 15 000 daily commuters."
"It hosted a bustling port."
"Despite housing only 7% of the population of Cyprus, it accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus."
"Despite these figures and the obvious benefit to Cyprus, the town has remained desolate."
"This is clearly not a tolerable situation for Cyprus or the people."
"Obviously something must be done."
"I find it incredible that the EU is not demanding the immediate and unconditional return of Famagusta to its inhabitants who are, incidentally, EU citizens."
"Instead we have this bizarre situation where the EU and many EU governments try to accommodate every one of Turkey's obscene demands and wishes."
"We all know that Turkey desires to join the EU."
"We know what a powerful country it is."
"However, we must ask ourselves whether Turkey is ready to join the European Union."
"Turkey is doing its accession cause no good."
"When I first came to this House, I voted to open talks with Turkey."
"I abstained in the latest vote."
"Will I have to vote against Turkish accession or will I feel a little goodwill on the part of Turkey some time soon?"
"I can see no good in this situation."
"Returning Famagusta would be an excellent opportunity for Turkey to show not only the original inhabitants of Famagusta but also the EU and the rest of the world that it is a peace-loving and peace-supporting nation."
"Mr President, since the Turkish invasion of 1974, Cyprus has remained tragically divided and the city of Famagusta has been occupied by the Turkish armed forces."
"We are now beginning to see a promising deal emerging under the Finnish Presidency of the EU, under which the Turkish-occupied north of the island can be reopened to direct trade through the port of Famagusta, under strict EU monitoring."
"This would be in exchange for the return by Turkey of the fenced-off area of Varosha to its original Greek Cypriot residents, under UN control."
"Fortunately, the original Greek Cypriot inhabitants can return with minimal disruption, as no one needs to be relocated because the depopulated Varosha area was sealed off in 1974 and is under the direct control of the Turkish military."
"Reference to the resettlement of Varosha was included in the 1979 Kyprianou-Denktas high-level agreement."
"It was agreed all that time ago that this would be implemented without awaiting the outcome of the discussion on other aspects of the Cyprus problem, or be used as a bargaining chip in dealing with other Cypriot issues."
"Certainly its return cannot be linked to the issue of Turkey implementing its firm commitment as an EU candidate state to open its ports to all Cypriot vessels, as agreed by Turkey under the Ankara Protocol on enlargement of the customs union, which must be extended to all EU Member States."
"These include the Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey ludicrously refuses to recognise legally, even though Cyprus is a full EU Member State."
"The Green Line also needs to be carefully monitored if direct trade from the north is resumed, with regard to potential increases in illegal immigration and people-trafficking, particularly of women from Eastern Europe."
"Furthermore, the so-called Republic of Northern Cyprus cannot be allowed to carry on as a sanctuary to escaped criminals, including notable UK fugitives from justice such as Mr Asil Nadir."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is, in European terms, intolerable that Varosha should be in the state it is: a ghost town, a town sealed off by barbed wire, yet, having formerly been home to some 30 000 people, it has been empty for 32 years."
"The people who once lived there can, from a distance, see their houses behind the fence; the desire to go back to them has never left them, and I believe they have a right to do that."
"I know, Commissioner, that we in this House and you in the Commission cannot sort out the Cyprus problem on our own."
"If things had gone the way this House, or the Commission, had wanted, a solution based on the Annan plan would be in place today, but, disappointed though we are by the Greek Cypriots' overwhelming 'no', we do have to respect it, and - let me make this quite plain - we actually have done so."
"We nevertheless hope for a solution soon."
"What really could create trust and encourage further positive developments would be for Varosha to be returned to its original inhabitants and governed by representatives of both communities, and for Cypriots of both ethnicities to live together in Famagusta."
"You have indicated, Commissioner, that the Finnish Presidency of the Council is currently endeavouring to facilitate the direct trade between the EU and Northern Cyprus that has been promised for over two years."
"We have given the Turkish Cypriots our word that this would be done."
"Opening up Varosha in line with the petitioners' request, though, could help people who have been waiting for thirty-two years to return there and would also make it possible for them to coexist in a new way, one that can open up the prospect of an overall solution."
"I hope that the Finnish Presidency will rethink its proposal in this regard."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus has for a long time been divided into three sections."
"Three percent of the territory is made up of British army bases."
"None of the local people knows what happens there, but they are clearly places where a number of foreigners earn good salaries."
"The General Affairs Council is calling on the Commission to support direct trade with the Turkish community in Cyprus in connection with the opening up of Famagusta - known as Varosha in Turkish - which is currently sealed off."
"Given that Parliament has discussed the release of an amount of money to develop and renew the infrastructure of the northern part of Cyprus, I should like to ask when, if Famagusta belongs to the northern part of the island, reconstruction work using the above-mentioned resources will start and when it will be open to the local population."
"If, on the other hand, it belongs to the south, when will it be open for the local inhabitants to begin rebuilding the town?"
"Or is there perhaps some third way forward, Commissioner?"
"Should the British units posted on the island be solving the problem?"
"(DE) Mr President, Strasbourg, this wonderful city, in which the European Parliament has its only seat, and will, it is to be hoped, continue to do so in future, was proposed, after the Second World War, as the capital city of an united Europe by the British Labour politician Ernest Bevin."
"He said at the time, that, as no city had suffered as much from human stupidity as Strasbourg, it was ideally suited to being the place where human stupidity was to be overcome."
"I wish we could soon be in a position to say something similar about Famagusta, which is symbolic of a brutal expulsion that is both contrary to international law and a violation of human rights, as brutal as it is senseless; yet it could, without difficulty, and by one simple act of goodwill, be made a symbol of the downfall of nationalism and expulsion, one whose impact would be felt a long distance away from Cyprus."
"I recall how, on one occasion when I was in Northern Cyprus, I had a Turkish Cypriot driver who spoke good Greek, and said: 'I have deep sympathy with my Greek-speaking fellow-Cypriots, and it is not the Greek Cypriots that are our problem, but the Turkish army and the settlers that have been brought into the country artificially.'"
"It is these people who have a vested interest in keeping this dispute alive."
"That is what we should do something about."
"We should ensure that both ethnic groups can be reconciled and that the expellees can return to their original homes in Famagusta; that would send out a message to the whole of the Mediterranean, to Europe and the world as a whole, affirming that people belonging to different ethnic groups can live together in peace under the rule of law."
"Cyprus could, in this respect, become an example for many, many other troublespots, and so I am grateful to the organisers of this petition for raising this issue."
"We owe it to them to stand alongside them in every way and secure them that to which they are entitled and for which they have been waiting for so long, namely that Famagusta should once more become the flourishing place of commerce and culture that it has been throughout its history - a history filled with proud traditions which, let it be hoped, may be re-established in the future."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 32 years after the military invasion and continuing occupation, the photographs emerging from the sealed-off area of Varosha, which is controlled solely by the Turkish army, bear irrefutable witness to the Cyprus tragedy, breaches of international and European law and the collapse of European democratic civilisation."
"The request by Greek-Cypriot citizens - refugees themselves like their Turkish-Cypriot fellow citizens in their own country - for the chance to return to their homes and properties, is a basic request for respect for humanitarian principles."
"At the same time, it is a vital initiative to build a climate of trust, security and reconciliation between the two communities, an initiative which surpasses the harsh reality of the partition and will help efforts to achieve joint development and coexistence and close the psychological gap between the two sides."
"If the European Union works consistently and decisively in the direction of confidence-building measures - and it can, Commissioner - then the necessary preconditions can be created for the resumption of an honest dialogue with the objective of a viable and operational solution to the Cyprus problem."
"The solution cannot be a matter for leaders and their political will alone."
"It is closely linked to the community and the citizens and with the feeling of justice which must be consolidated."
"In the history of Cyprus there have been many lost opportunities at political level."
"We must not waste opportunities at social level for the peaceful reunification of the island for the benefit of all its citizens, both Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot."
"(PL) Mr President, as far as the facts of the matter are concerned, a lot has already been said about Famagusta's status."
"I would like to highlight three points."
"First of all, the inhabitants have the right to their own property and have the right to return there."
"Secondly, the problem of Famagusta is like schizophrenia, or like a cancer on the body of the European Union."
"If we are unable to deal with this situation, I doubt that we will be able to cope with Turkey's accession to the Union at some point in the future."
"Finally, Mr President, you yourself, all the European institutions, and European democracy as a whole, will one day be judged and accused of failing to protect the legacy of the culture in which we were all raised. Famagusta is a good example of this cultural heritage and we cannot allow everything there to fall into ruin, as already appears to be the case."
"If we are dealing with an occupying power, then it seems to me that we have to adopt a different strategy."
"The current strategy is not effective and we are all responsible for that, yourself, Mr President, included."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, many speakers have said that the division of Cyprus is tragic."
"I fully agree."
"Reunification should have happened yesterday at the latest."
"The European Union consistently supports these efforts, and the EU has tried to take its own part, with the Commission being actively involved in all these efforts."
"With the involvement of all the presidencies in these efforts in the last couple of years, the European Union has invested an enormous amount of energy and effort in solving the Cyprus dilemma."
"Today, the Finnish formula is likely to be the last chance for several years to unblock the current stalemate."
"Therefore it should be taken extremely seriously."
"Judging by last Monday's Council Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the European Union, the EU Member States are indeed supportive of the Finnish efforts."
"So is the Commission, with both the political ways and means and legal and other substantive expertise to facilitate solutions."
"To sum up, everybody should seize this opportunity and thus create a real win-win situation for everybody, including the Varosha refugees."
"The debate is closed."
"1."
"Ethiopia"
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Ethiopia."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, the news of the ongoing arrests, humiliation and intimidation of opposition politicians and students in Ethiopia has caused outrage and these actions should be decisively condemned."
"The recent arrest and expulsion from Ethiopia of two European Commission officials, who were accused of attempting to help Yalemzewd Bekele, a lawyer and women's rights advocate working for the European Commission in Addis Ababa, only serves to underline the gravity of the situation."
"Neither should we forget about the fact that 111 people are still in detention following the mass arrest of opposition supporters during demonstrations held in June and November 2005."
"I call upon the Commission and to the Council to do everything in their power to initiate a broad dialogue in Ethiopia, which would involve the participation of the political parties, civil society organisation and the authorities, to agree on a permanent solution to the current political crisis."
"We have to do all we can to make sure that the enduring principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law are re-established in that country."
"In order for this to happen, the Ethiopian authorities must show the world that they are willing to resolve the current crisis."
"The immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners would certainly constitute such a gesture of goodwill."
"author. - Mr President, the issue of human rights in Ethiopia has been the subject of numerous previous motions for resolution in this House."
"Unfortunately, it seems that our advisory words of wisdom and strong condemnation have been falling on deaf ears as far as the Ethiopian Government is concerned."
"However, who can blame it for behaving in such an arbitrary and totally unacceptable manner towards this Parliament when the Commission, for reasons best known to itself, invited Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to address the European Development Days specifically on governance issues?"
"That inevitably sent out the wrong signal with regard to the EU's policy on respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance."
"Perhaps the Commissioner might be kind enough to explain to us today what the logic was behind that invitation."
"We all understand the difficulties Ethiopia has been facing in its troubled post-colonial history and realise that some blame lies clearly and squarely with the ex-colonisers."
"We all want to help the Ethiopian people to achieve an acceptable standard of living, free of the evils of internal fighting and regional conflict."
"However, the governing regime in Addis Ababa must understand comprehensively and unequivocally that the highly-desired political stability will not be achieved through continuing arrests, harassment, arbitrary detention, humiliation and the intimidation of opposition politicians, civil society activists, students and other ordinary citizens."
"Such actions are, on the contrary, bound to lead to a deterioration of the already fragile political situation in Ethiopia, and the feared further worsening of the situation will become a certainty rather than a possibility."
"I urge colleagues to support this motion for a resolution, and I wait with interest to hear the Commissioner's comments on the issue of the invitation to Mr Meles Zenawi."
"author. - (PT) The repression of students and of the Oromo, Amhara and other ethnic groups in Ethiopia; the continuing imprisonment and mock trials of elected opposition leaders, trade union leaders, journalists, teachers, human rights and development activists, and many other Ethiopians who are fighting for freedom and democracy; the manipulation by the Meles Zenawi government of the conclusions reached by the commission of inquiry into the massacre of 193 people in June and November 2005, following protests about election fraud, and the persecution of the judges in that commission who refused to alter their findings and were therefore forced to flee the country; the detention of the lawyer Yalemzewd Bekele, who was working for the European Union delegation, and the unjustified expulsion of European diplomats in violation of the Vienna Convention - all these events not only demonstrate how anti-democratic and totalitarian the Meles Zenawi regime is, but also expose its growing fragility and desperation."
"Ever since the conclusions of the EU election observation mission in 2005, the Member States' governments in the Council and the Commission should have been working together to take action regarding Mr Meles Zenawi's regime."
"As Teshale Aberra, one of the judges who had to flee the country, said, the Meles Zenawi government is just as bad as, or even worse than, the Mengistu regime."
"Ethiopia receives financial aid from the European Union, and therefore the European Union must demand the immediate release of all political prisoners. It must also demand that an international inquiry into the 2005 massacres be set up and that those responsible for the massacres be brought to justice."
"Such measures include freezing the European assets of Mr Meles Zenawi and members of his government and denying them entry visas to Europe."
"All these measures must be designed so as to hit those who are primarily responsible, and not to hurt the Ethiopian people."
"Our governments and the Commission must stop justifying their tolerant attitude towards this anti-democratic regime that violates human rights, on the pretext that it is an ally in the fight against terrorism."
"We in Europe and the United States must stop deluding ourselves."
"Ethiopia's intervention in Somalia on the pretext of fighting terrorism has only served to entrench the Islamic Courts in Mogadishu, and the disastrous consequences do not stop there: discredited and lacking in popular support, Mr Meles Zenawi's regime has left Ethiopia itself, Africa's second most populous country, wide open to infiltration by terrorists."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last month, Mrs Kinnock and I, together with two African colleagues, had the privilege of leading a delegation to Ethiopia, where we had talks with both the government and the opposition, as well as with members of the families of detained dissidents."
"We are very concerned about the situation there."
"We have found a complete lack of willingness - particularly on the part of the government - to learn any real lessons from the results of the elections, or, on the other hand, from the findings of a commission of inquiry into the parliament that the government had itself set up."
"We have urged the Prime Minister to take these findings from the commission of inquiry as the starting point for a nationwide dialogue."
"To that he gave no clear response; on the contrary, indeed, we have discovered that the members of this commission have been subject to duress and that some of them have fled abroad."
"If the report is published at all, it will no doubt appear in a polished-up and falsified form."
"We are grateful to the President of the Commission for speaking to the prime minister in such very plain terms of the occasion of his visit, but it is unfortunate that the environment Commissioner should, by inviting Mr Meles to visit Brussels, undermine the Commission's stance."
"I think it important that we should, now that we are equipping ourselves with a new instrument for democracy and human rights, ensure that it is an effective one and one that enables us to support democratic political forces."
"The new regulation must include a form of words to this effect, for how else are we to provide the opposition with legal counsel or help newly-elected parliamentarians who have no money to exercise their constitutional rights?"
"It is for that reason that I call on not only the Commission, but also and in particular on the Member States to abandon their resistance to an effective instrument for democracy and human rights being drafted in these terms."
"author. - Mr President, in these debates we regularly stress the importance of dialogue and frank discussion."
"In Ethiopia's case that dialogue will be a critical one, both in the sense of it being important and in the sense of our being critical of the Ethiopian Government's current practices."
"The omens are not good."
"Some 193 citizens were killed in the riots in June and November 2005."
"The report on that inquiry remains unpublished, sanitised and unclear."
"Since that time a number of Ethiopians have been imprisoned, and recently two EU officials were expelled from the country."
"All this is not news to anyone involved in this debate, but things are stacking up and do not look good for Ethiopia."
"Dialogue will indeed be critical and, as Mr Matsakis says, paragraph 7 of this resolution expresses regret at the forthcoming visit of Prime Minister Zenawi to Brussels to tell us about good governance."
"This is an irony that would be funny were it not so tragic."
"However, let us be positive."
"The Commissioner will hopefully tell us today that this will give us the opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Zenawi and tell him frankly of our concerns."
"I hope the Commissioner will confirm that this opportunity will not be missed when Mr Zenawi comes to Brussels."
"Ethiopia plays an important role in the African Union and an important role in development."
"We could work much better in cooperation with one another."
"However, that cooperation, as colleagues have mentioned, should not be taken for granted and must be based on mutual principles and, importantly, adherence to them."
"If we do not stick to our principles we can hardly expect others to, so I hope we can have a frank and open discussion with the Prime Minister when he comes to Brussels."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the outcome of the parliamentary elections on 15 May 2005 saw an atmosphere of political repression fall over Ethiopia once more, and once more too, then, we find ourselves gathered here in this House discussing that country."
"Its manipulation of the elections and its repressive response to popular unrest have cost the Ethiopian Government respect at home and abroad and have cost the country itself its stability."
"The only way to counteract this is to resume the process of democratisation and involve the opposition parties in it."
"A year ago, the Ethiopian parliament set up a commission to investigate the murders committed in June and November 2005, and we call on the Ethiopian Government to publish that commission's final report without delay, without alteration and at full length."
"The findings must be put before the competent courts and used as the basis for fair proceedings in them."
"We also call on the Ethiopian Government to release all political prisoners without delay and unconditionally."
"Mr President, we are well aware of the fact that all countries and societies around the world have the right to freedom and independence."
"I should point out that today, we are talking about a very specific country, a country whose history is older than the history of many, or even most, European countries, who consider their roots to lie in the times of the Old Testament rulers King David and the Queen of Sheba."
"This country, which also adopted Christianity earlier than many, if not most, European countries, is a country that is also entirely unique on the African continent."
"It has maintained its sovereignty throughout its history, with the exception of a short period in the thirties, when it was conquered by a European state."
"Even then, it maintained its independence in legal terms."
"Even during that invasion, which was an attempt to impose colonial rule, Emperor Haile Selassie, the country's honourable ruler, who was greatly respected throughout the world and in Ethiopia, represented his country when he was an expatriate and in exile."
"In the seventies, Ethiopia was the victim of a communist plot, involving the Kremlin and Cuba."
"Since then, it has not managed to return to normality."
"I do not want to repeat that which has already been said about the current suffering of the Ethiopian people, but it really is our duty to aid this country and its society."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission has unfortunately behaved like a bull in a china shop by inviting the Ethiopian Prime Minister to the European Development Days."
"This event, to which the Prime Minister of Ethiopia has been invited as a guest, began on the same day as the Parliamentary session and will end tomorrow."
"The Ethiopian Prime Minister has even appeared as a speaker."
"The European Commission has decided that it would prefer to turn a deaf ear to the reports of persecution that are emerging from Ethiopia."
"However, we in the European Union cannot pretend that we are dealing with a normal country."
"In fact, quite the opposite is the case."
"We are dealing with a country which is a political prison for many journalists, trade unionists and human rights advocates."
"We do not even know how large a prison it is, as the Ethiopian government systematically refuses to reveal how many political prisoners there are or how many people have been arrested."
"Recently, members of yet another profession, namely teachers, were arrested."
"Clearly the attitude of the European Commission and the Council towards Ethiopia must depend on whether Ethiopia upholds human rights and, first and foremost, whether it agrees to release political prisoners or not."
"However, it should also be made clear that this is not only a matter that concerns the European Union."
"The African Union must also take action."
"That is why I stress that both unions need to deal with the issue."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, after the post-2005 election crisis the Commission, in close cooperation with the EU Member States and the international community, undertook efforts to defuse tensions and urged the Ethiopian Government to restore confidence in the democratisation process through the release of political detainees."
"The EU, in line with the international donor community, has given priority to maintaining an open and structured dialogue with the Ethiopian Government as the most appropriate way towards improving the situation."
"Following a visit to key political detainees, Commissioner Michel received commitments from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during a dialogue in February that they would get a short and fair trial."
"President Barroso met Prime Minister Zenawi in Addis Ababa last October to express the Commission's concerns about the trial and the prisoners."
"President Barroso pointed out that he expected the trial to be speedy, fair and transparent."
"He also stressed that he did not consider a trial to be an appropriate response to the Ethiopian political differences."
"Instead, he suggested reconciliation and dialogue as the only way forward in building confidence."
"When two members of the Commission delegation were arrested and expelled from Ethiopia and a local employee of the delegation was arrested, President Barroso, Commissioner Michel and EU Member States immediately expressed their deep concern at these events, which clearly breached the Vienna Convention."
"The Commission strongly refuted the accusation against the Commission delegation and its staff."
"The Commission headquarters expressed its support and solidarity with the delegation staff and we were satisfied that this immediate and strong reaction resulted in the release of the arrested local agent on bail."
"There have been some doubts as to the wisdom of inviting Prime Minister Zenawi to the European Development Days."
"The Commission believes that dialogue and further efforts have to be pursued to convey EU concerns to the Ethiopian Government and to obtain commitments on democratic reforms and good governance."
"The meetings and debates planned for the European Development Days will provide an opportunity to convey these messages directly and express our deep concerns."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"2."
"Bangladesh"
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Bangladesh."
"author. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Bangladesh is one of the world's most overcrowded and poorest countries."
"In the 1940s Bangladesh was divided into two sections on the basis of religion, which failed to ease an already complicated situation."
"The subsequent war of independence with Pakistan only served to exacerbate the extreme poverty, and not only in the provinces."
"In the country's constitution, there is a special mechanism for placing power into the hands of the incumbent government during the preparation of elections."
"It is known the world over that microloans have been a great success."
"Less well known is that this success has, in this strongly Islamic country, been due especially to the commitment of women."
"As in any vastly overcrowded and very poor country, there are huge problems with inadequate infrastructure and with religious and ethic intolerance."
"I believe that these problems can be reduced and that the secular tradition can prevail."
"A difficult problem in any election, and not only in developing countries, is the question of who is eligible to vote."
"In Bangladesh the problem is exacerbated by the fact that a section of the population is illiterate."
"The next most important thing after factually correct electoral registers is for candidates to have the opportunity to present their manifestos."
"It is no wonder that the proposed text of the resolution also highlights this."
"I should like to emphasise at this point that I do not believe that the recognition or otherwise of journalists by any country in the world can serve as a yardstick of democratisation."
"In any event, freedom of the press is closely associated with the democratic competition of ideas and manifestos."
"This is something that must not under any circumstances be compromised in the run-up to elections."
"Similarly, it is the permanent responsibility of all governments to eliminate terrorist groups."
"A more complex issue is how to define the word terrorist, and how to fight terrorism in a democratic society."
"At the last meeting of the group for cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, which I had the honour of chairing, those in attendance expressed the view that it is possible for genuinely democratic elections to take place in Bangladesh."
"The observations contained in the motion for a resolution made their mark in the meeting I chaired, and I believe that sending a European Parliament observation mission will help towards the democratic running of the elections."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left supports the motion for a resolution before us, and I believe that we must support the process of democratisation in Bangladesh, including helping to make these elections as democratic as possible."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Bangladesh, land of democratic tradition, of respect for human rights, of independence of the judiciary and of freedom of the press that it is, is today plagued by the rise of violent Islamic fundamentalism."
"The last 'Reporters without Borders' report reveals hundreds of attacks on freedom of the press."
"This year alone, three journalists have been killed, at least 95 others have been attacked and dozens, if not hundreds, of correspondents have been forced to flee after being intimidated for writing articles that are deemed to be 'un-Islamic'."
"If it was my wish for Parliament urgently to voice its opinion on this situation today, it is because, right now, in Dhaka, Salah Choudhury is standing trial for sedition."
"This journalist, the editor of the Weekly Blitz, is a fervent supporter of moderate Islam, who advocates openness and dialogue between religions and recognition by his country of the State of Israel."
"For these reasons and for these reasons alone, he is in danger today of being sentenced to death."
"We urge the Commission to follow the developments in this trial so as to ensure that the rights of the defendant, together with the international conventions on freedom of the press, are respected."
"Since I have a few seconds left, I should like to declare my support for the interim government's efforts to ensure that the pre-election process also complies with international democratic standards: the establishment of an appropriate electoral register, a truly independent electoral commission and, I shall come back to it once again, the balance and freedom of the media during the election campaign, of course."
"It is quite clear that the country's four private television channels have difficulty in putting forward a different point of view to that of the government if they want to keep their licences."
"Two terrorist leaders have been arrested in Bangladesh; continued efforts must be made to disarm the Islamic militias that are trying to put pressure on the voters on the eve of the election."
"We expect the government to confirm its commitment in this regard, too."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, Bangladesh is an important partner for the European Union."
"It is a country which has made significant economic progress during the last few years."
"At the moment, its most famous citizen is Mohammad Junus, who received the Nobel Peace Prize this year for his contribution to the fight against poverty by means of a system of microcredits."
"However, Bangladesh is not struggling just with poverty, but also with corruption and an increasingly antagonistic attitude displayed by followers of Islam."
"The creation of the caretaker government headed by President Iajuddin Ahmed was met with protests from Bangladeshi society."
"According to reports by external observers and the Awami League, the authorities illegally increased the voting lists for the upcoming elections by 13 million surnames."
"The caretaker government must guarantee free elections which comply with international standards."
"The independence of the electoral committee also needs to be guaranteed and the electoral roll simply needs to be credible."
"An agreement between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Awami League and the other parties on the creation of a common economic programme, which is vital in order to improve the living conditions and civil liberties of the people of Bangladesh would undoubtedly be a basis for political stability in the country."
"Under the terms of key international human rights conventions, the interim government has to combat lawlessness, extra-judicial executions and torture, which are usually the work of the police or the security forces."
"Meanwhile, the situation is as follows: last year three journalists were killed and nearly 100 people were victims of intimidation or sustained physical injuries."
"Attacks on staff of non-governmental organisations are increasing from day to day."
"Religious minorities, namely Hindus and Christians, are living in danger."
"Rape and human trafficking involving women and children are commonplace."
"The impression is that everything that has been achieved in terms of democracy in the country is disappearing as a result of the growing violence on the part of Islamic fundamentalists."
"The Council and the European Commission should systematically monitor the human rights situation in Bangladesh."
"They should also monitor the situation as regards freedom of speech and freedom of the press."
"We hope that the planned European Union observation mission to Bangladesh, to supervise the forthcoming elections in January, will help to ensure that the election process is democratic."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, it was a fortnight ago that it all started, when the outgoing prime minister of Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia, made a controversial address on the television, whereupon violent clashes broke out in the capital, Dhaka, in which three people were killed and hundreds injured."
"The opposition charged Zia with filling the key posts in her interim government with sympathisers, accused the head of the electoral commission of being biased and asserted that there were 13 million invalid names in the electoral register."
"More violence broke out at the beginning of this week, with all transit routes to Dhaka by land or water being blockaded, journalists attacked and seriously wounded, 20 000 members of the security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets in street battles, all of which left seventeen people dead and thousands injured."
"There are increasing attacks by Islamists on adherents of other religions, and I condemn, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the acts of bloody violence and the constant assaults by Islamic extremists on religious minorities such as Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus, and the suppression of press freedom, which other Members have already denounced."
"Those in power - who belong to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party - and the Awami League opposition, must bury their personal animosities once and for all and embark upon purposeful dialogue."
"A date has been set for elections, and it must be kept to; the electoral commission must start preparing for them now, and that means, above all else, making sure that the electoral register is correct."
"The conditions currently prevailing - which are tantamount to civil war - must be normalised as soon as possible, with the Islamists being disarmed."
"The citizens must be enabled to avail themselves of their right to vote without fear of reprisals in order that democracy may be given a chance."
"I welcome the Commission's willingness to send election observers to Bangladesh, and this House should resolve to do likewise."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, a few weeks ago, the European Parliament, in the context of its interparliamentary delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, invited over a great many representatives of Bangladeshi civil society, and it was very interesting."
"It was very interesting, firstly, to see the reaction of the Bangladeshi ambassador, who had been nominated, the poor man, that very day and who was getting to grips with what Parliament was all about on that occasion: he saw the devastation that democracy and transparency can cause when they are applied!"
"We did, indeed, learn many things that day, which was very useful because the representatives of your Commission who were present were not really keen, at the start of the morning, to go and ascertain what was taking place on the ground."
"Having heard what we all heard, they were well and truly obliged, at the end of the meeting, to acknowledge that intervention was needed, so serious is the situation on the ground."
"I shall not go back over what was said by my fellow Members regarding the poverty, corruption, violence and torture - torture inflicted not only by the squadrons of the various militias, but also by the police."
"The figures in this regard are terrible: in 2005, 2 297 cases of torture were recorded as having been carried out by the police."
"I shall mention the case of the journalist, Mr Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, who is in danger of being sentenced to death on the sole grounds that he expressed his opinion freely: this is totally unbearable!"
"I could also quote a figure that comes from your Commission, Commissioner: your own services estimate that more than 13 million invalid names have been added to the electoral register."
"How can elections be contemplated when it is already clear that there will be such a huge amount of fraud, so much organised fraud?"
"That is why, over and above the vote in favour that the vast majority of us are, I hope, going to cast today, the Commission really must provide itself with all of the resources needed to send out signals on the ground aimed at making the government quickly move the goalposts, so as to bring it into line with the democratic standards that existed in this country a few years ago, and to thus put a stop to the institutional violence that is sadly degenerating into social violence."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it must be a top EU priority to ensure free and fair elections next year in Bangladesh, a traditionally secular and democratic country of 140 million people."
"For many years since its foundation in 1971, Bangladesh was the exception in the Islamic world as it pursued its independent course as a Bengali nation in a peaceful and democratic fashion."
"Regrettably, since 2001 there has been increasing Islamicisation of Bangladesh as Islamists have attempted to fill the vacuum left by corrupt warring secular parties. The NGO Task Force against Torture has documented over 500 cases of torture and intimidation by radical Islamists who have also murdered supporters of the Communist Party."
"Indeed, Hindus, Ahmadis, Christians, Chittagong Hill Tract tribal people and Buddhists have also been targeted."
"Recent civil unrest took to the streets with violent outbreaks as the Awami League opposition doubted the impartiality of the electoral commission, the integrity of the voters' list or even the impartiality of the original caretaker prime ministerial nominee."
"The EU-Bangladesh Cooperation Agreement of 2000 is based on respect for democratic principles pursuant to Article 1, and its breach can lead to the suspension of the agreement and with it the significant EU Generalised System of Tariff Preferences and EU foreign aid, which amounts to 70% of Bangladesh's total foreign aid."
"The EU and all the major donors must now coordinate to keep up the pressure for reform and full respect for democracy, a free press and human rights for all of Bangladesh's citizens prior to the parliamentary elections scheduled to take place next January."
"We must send short-term political observers from the European Parliament in substantial numbers."
"These elections are crucial and it is essential that the EU maintains a visible major presence throughout the Caretaker Government period, as otherwise some frustrated, power-hungry general might consider launching a military coup."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as I am sure we are aware, the people of the Ganges and Brahmaputra deltas do not conceal their admiration for the Afghan Taliban and also want, in their country, to emulate Mullah Omar's Emirate of Afghanistan."
"In order to achieve their ends, these holy warriors resort unscrupulously to violence."
"It was unfortunate that the government of Bangladesh did not take initial warnings about the rapid rise of these terrorist groups seriously enough."
"Events have quickly proved that they are not a figment of the fevered imaginations of jealous opposition leaders or sensation-hungry journalists."
"Many of them have paid the highest price for revealing the truth, and many others have been forced to flee the country."
"In this situation, it is reassuring to know that two people have been arrested on suspicion of leading terrorist groups."
"However, we must not be satisfied with that."
"If we thoroughly examine the situation in this country, which for many years has failed to comply with recognised European standards in the field of human rights, in spite of drastic measures taken by the government to prevent extremist violence against religious minorities, we are still witnessing chilling and nightmarish events."
"The country is also beset by many other problems, which is why I wholeheartedly support the Commission's decision to send an Election Observation Mission and to ask the European Parliament to do the same."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, as Members of the European Parliament we claim to be committed to human rights."
"I therefore hope we take a strong stance in relation to Mr Choudhury's plight."
"Mr Choudhury is a journalist facing charges of sedition in connection with a series of articles he published that Bangladeshi authorities deemed favourable to Israel and critical of Muslim extremism."
"His points in favour of moderation and dialogue will surely be supported by every Member of this House."
"Nothing he said is without grounding and in any modern-day democratic country such articles would considered objective and informative to the public."
"This is not the case, however, in Bangladesh, where Mr Choudhury has been put on trial and could be executed for his articles."
"He has received death threats and been assaulted, imprisoned, beaten and tortured."
"Mr Choudhury is now facing an unfair trial and has little chance of seeing justice."
"The presiding judge has commented in open court that Mr Choudhury has hurt the sentiments of Muslims."
"It is clear that the judge is hoping for a death sentence."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we cannot stand idly by while an innocent journalist is facing an unfair trial and probable death."
"I am glad to see his situation specifically mentioned in this resolution, as well as support for free and fair elections in Bangladesh."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission shares Parliament's concerns and welcomes the opportunity to discuss Bangladesh today."
"The country is at a critical juncture of its fragile democracy."
"Much is at stake with the forthcoming elections in this densely populated country."
"Regrettably, however, the institutional framework and the acrimonious relations between the two main political parties do not bode well for a peaceful and democratic electoral process."
"Over the last weeks and months, the Commission and the seven Member States with representations in Dhaka, as well as the wider international community, have been intensely engaged with the main party leaders and election stakeholders, urging all of them to agree on an electoral framework that achieves the trust of all parties."
"The EU regional Troika in February, local EU Presidency representatives and several high-level visits from the Commission and Member States have consistently emphasised the need for impartial guidance of the country by the Caretaker Government in the pre-electoral period, a neutral Election Commission, and a credible voter list."
"As you might be aware, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has taken the political decision to deploy an EU Election Observation mission for these elections."
"Preparation for the deployment of EU observers, including internal procedures between the institutions for financing the mission, are currently under way."
"In her letter to the President, or Chief Adviser, she underlines the above issues as the key concerns of the European Union."
"The mission would be deployed around six weeks before election day, and it would remain in the country for some two to three weeks after that day, in order to follow the post-election period, particularly in the light of the unfortunate possibility of post-election violence, especially against minorities."
"The Commission shares Parliament's concerns over the widespread violence against journalists."
"The fact that the latest report by Reporters sans Frontières categorises Bangladesh as an extremely dangerous place for journalists unfortunately speaks for itself."
"The Commission has consistently condemned the intimidation and high level of impunity that apply to violent acts against journalists in that country."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"3."
"Iran"
"The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Iran."
"Author. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one can now be in any doubt that neoconservative policies, including the doctrine of global intervention, have failed."
"They have failed in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan, and also in relation to Iran."
"The US-led 'war on terror' has strengthened Iran's power and influence in the Middle East, and until there is stability in the region, Iran's influence will continue to grow, along with its efforts to stand up to pressure from the West."
"Furthermore, the more the West threatens Iran, the more it boosts radical forces in Iran."
"At the same time, it cannot be ignored that the only country in the region that has pursued a clear policy of pluralism and has undergone significant internal change is indeed Iran."
"If there is one country in the world that should not require external help to rid itself of extremism it is Iran."
"If there is a regime that should not be given any motivation by the West to obtain nuclear weapons it is Iran."
"US and British policy in particular, however, is doing precisely that, rather than engaging in sensitive political negotiation."
"Iran should of course emphasise its determination to meet its international obligations."
"I wish to point out once again, however, that Parliament should support human rights and non-discrimination anywhere in the world. I shall make one final remark: in the territory of the EU Member States, there are so many social problems building up with an unavoidable human rights dimension that debate on the issue should also refer to these states."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it is terribly sad that we have to keep on adopting resolutions on the violations of human rights that go on in one country or another."
"Over the past two years, as many as six resolutions, statements and reports from various institutions and organisations on the subject of Iran have been adopted."
"To our sorrow, we cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that the situation there has got worse rather than better."
"There is no freedom of opinion or of the press; the Internet is censored and independent newspapers closed down."
"There are apparently more jailed journalists in the Islamic Republic of Iran than anywhere else in the Middle East, and torture is a daily occurrence."
"Those of us who were members of the inter-parliamentary delegation were constantly assured, in many conversations, that the above assertions bore no relation to the facts."
"Unfortunately, those on the receiving end of such treatment tell another story."
"There is no respect for women's rights; for example, women are prevented from observing International Women's Day publicly."
"A demonstration on 12 June by women and men who had campaigned against the legal discrimination against women was broken up violently."
"That there has been a first visit to this House by a delegation from the Majlis has been a step in the right direction in seeking dialogue with parliamentarians and the general public, and respect for human rights and human dignity was at the heart of this debate, in which we were told that all the accusations levelled against Iran were far removed from the truth."
"We now call on the Iranians' representative body - the Majlis - and the Iranian Government to do all in their power to confirm this by backing these statements up with actions."
"The human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran has also ground to a halt, and we should try to ensure its resumption."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, you might give some thought to the possibility of a radio and television station that would make possible broadcasts to Iran containing information about Europe and European policies, which would be of use to the people who live there."
"Mr President, to repeat over and over again that the human rights situation in Iran is worrying is a euphemism, so scornful of basic freedoms and rights is Tehran's theocratic regime."
"How can one fail to establish a link between the election in June 2005 of the conservative and revisionist president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the growing trend of repression and persecution, the victims of which are not only the Arab, Azeri and Kurdish minorities and the religious minorities - Christians, Jews, Baha'is and Sufis - but also homosexuals and women, who are not a minority, but who continue to fall victim to countless forms of discrimination?"
"If I had to mention just two points in our resolution, I would point out, firstly, that Iran holds the world record for the highest number of executions of young people, bread or bicycle thieves and homosexuals."
"I would then point out that the government has declared that the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, which was cofounded by the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mrs Shirin Ebadi, is unlawful."
"European diplomacy must make itself heard on such concrete examples as these."
"Given that the Iranian Government dares to state that the punishment of death by stoning no longer exists in the country, I call on the Commission to take up the case with Tehran of the 11 people who have been sentenced to death by stoning, and I have here the names of the nine women and two men sentenced."
"Tehran must waste no time in bringing us proof and in backing up its words with action."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, you may well be surprised to learn that I agree with much of what Mr Strož had to say in this speech, but such is indeed the case, for I do believe that we have to paint a very nuanced picture of Iran, and that is why we have drafted a very wide-ranging and exhaustive resolution, as evidence, on the one hand, of how very concerned we are about the situation there, and also of how seriously we take that country and how important we believe it to be."
"It is one of the oldest cultures in the world, and has been a world power for millennia; we must endeavour, by means of astute policies and diplomacy, to re-integrate it, step by step, into the international community, among those countries that co-exist as neighbours."
"If that is to happen, though, there must of course be some fundamental changes in Iran."
"The issue of minorities has also been brought up, and it is, in Iran - which is actually a multi-ethnic state, and so one cannot actually speak in terms of minorities - the various nations and ethnic groups have done a good job of living together since ancient times."
"It also showed greater religious tolerance than did many other states in the region, but the position today is such that the state's official Islamic ideology makes life very difficult for minorities such as the Azeri or adherents of other religions, not least for other strands of Islam such as the Sufis."
"On the other hand, though, there is certainly evidence coming out of Iran indicating that more and more self-confident women are going into politics, that a new generation is going down completely new paths and that this implies a great deal of hope for the future."
"We must therefore consider this multi-faceted structure as it is and without isolating it."
"We have to seek out contacts with the various communities and ethnic groups, and with every generation of this people, while at the same time making it clear that we do not accept under any circumstances rule by the police, the suppression of opinions, or the persecution of people by reason of their religious or other convictions, and that we repudiate all the more so the anti-Israel utterances of President Ahmadinejad, under whose leadership - it has to be said with some regret - conditions in this great country have taken a turn for the worse."
"Taking energetic action to address that state of affairs is our duty as Europeans; if we are to do that, we need to cooperate with the United States of America, and I hope that one consequence of the latest political developments will be that cooperation with them on this issue will improve."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, during the last year, and despite numerous undertakings by the Iranian Government to promote universal values, the civil rights, political freedoms and human rights situation in this country has deteriorated."
"We are receiving more and more information about the use of torture and the inhumane treatment of prisoners."
"The increasing number of reports concerning arrests of and threats against journalists is a particular cause for concern."
"Since the start of the year, at least 16 journalists have been arrested, which places Iran amongst the worst countries in the world in terms of restrictions imposed on the freedom of the press."
"We are also concerned by the fact that Iran, in spite of the European Union's efforts, has not agreed to a second round of the dialogue on human rights which began in 2002."
"The time has come for the European Union to get tough and decisive in its talks with Iran on the issue of human rights."
"Iran will only become a legitimate partner of the European Union and of the whole world if it gives everyone access to civil rights and political freedoms."
"(SV) Mr President, Iran is a nation with thousands of years of cultural history behind it, a country of great riches and with a lot to offer its people and the world."
"Yet what does the current regime offer its people?"
"Oppression, imprisonment, unemployment and censorship!"
"President Ahmadinejad took office on 3 August 2005, since which time the situation has deteriorated."
"The present government offers its people ferocious corporal punishment."
"Six hundred children keep their mothers company in prison."
"Prisoners may have only three square metres in which to move around, but they are the lucky ones compared to those subjected to the death penalty."
"Iran even manages to execute more people than the USA."
"One hundred and eleven people have been executed in the last 12 months."
"The absolutely most flagrant breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Iran is indeed a signatory, however, is the death penalty for minors."
"A regime that does not allow young people to do their penance and mend their ways has no future; it will fall."
"Iran has great potential, but while the regime there engages in persecuting academics, journalists and political activists instead of exploiting their potential, then the country and its people will continue to suffer."
"Many hands have been stretched out to Iran, and the European Parliament is stretching out another to it today."
"Release the political prisoners, the journalists and the representatives of minorities mentioned in today's resolution."
"These are not big demands, but if they are met, the way can be paved for an improved dialogue."
"Why is the Iranian regime so scared of women?"
"Let them participate, be elected, work, live and play their roles on the same terms as men."
"To do this is to double the potential for development in a society."
"There is hope."
"Already, UN delegations are being permitted to inspect various facilities, and a few political prisoners have been freed."
"However, the new government must seize the opportunity of adopting a policy that no longer shuts out the outside world and that gives women democratic rights."
"That is the future."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, three weeks ago I attended the granting of an honorary doctorate to former President Khatami of Iran at my former university in my home town of St Andrews - the oldest Scottish university and one of the oldest and most venerable European universities."
"In his valedictory lecture, former President Khatami appealed for a dialogue of civilisations, a dialogue of religions."
"That is, surely, the only way we will achieve that essential understanding between our respective positions."
"It is in that spirit that I support this motion."
"We appeal to the Iranian authorities and the Iranian people to understand how difficult it is for us to accept the numerous and repeated infringements of such clearly basic human rights as religious rights, women's rights, children's rights, minority rights, rights to justice, rights to freedom of speech and thought, and press freedom, as listed in this resolution."
"We urge the Iranian authorities to respond positively to our appeals in order that we can proceed to a positive dialogue, which can only be to the benefit of Europe and Iran, and of peace and understanding between our peoples."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, during the new academic year, which began at the end of September this year, over a dozen students in Iran were denied access to higher education because of their political beliefs."
"Others were informed that they could begin their studies if they signed a kind of statement of loyalty to the current regime."
"According to Human Rights Watch, the Iranian authorities have denied at least seventeen students access to higher education: six in 2005-2006 and eleven in September this year."
"Since July 2005, disciplinary committees have suspended at least 41 students for at least two semesters."
"Human Rights Watch also has the surnames of 35 students who have been convicted since 2005 for their political activities in student unions."
"The brightest young Iranians are seeing their right to higher education restricted because of their political convictions and world view."
"This is not simply a sign of this regime's authoritarian stance, but is also particularly damaging to the development of Iranian society and goes against Iranian national interests."
"The European Union should implement a grant fund which would allow young Iranians who have been barred from studying in Iran due to their convictions, to continue their studies in higher education institutions in the European Member States."
"It is also particularly important for the European Union to set up a radio and television network broadcasting programmes in Farsi, which would provide information about the culture, politics and society of the European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in the last year we have suddenly witnessed a deterioration in the situation regarding respect for civil rights and political freedoms in Iran."
"This has been acknowledged by the Iranian authorities themselves in a move which in itself is a healthy sign."
"A report prepared by the judiciary provides clear and detailed evidence of human rights violations, including torture and the maltreatment of prisoners."
"In addition, there are numerous reported cases in Iran today of executions of juvenile offenders and persecution of liberal and secular academics and journalists."
"Furthermore, freedom of religion, freedom of the press and the rights of women, as well as minority rights, are not properly respected."
"The authorities in Tehran have to realise that there can be no excuse for violating the basic human rights of its proud people and that, if such violations continue, this will only harm Iran's attempts to achieve stability, progress and prosperity for its own citizens, and will no doubt further adversely affect its relations with the West."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, what we have here is a catalogue of the most despicable acts which we most frequently encounter when discussing various deplorable dictatorships."
"Of course, these acts include religious persecution, namely the persecution of Christians."
"A press report appeared fairly recently on the execution of a fourteen-year old boy, who said 'I am not dying because I am a sinner, but because I am a Christian.'"
"The death penalty is applied in an incredibly light-handed manner."
"It is cruel and includes the stoning of minors and the persecution of national groups other than those whose representatives are in power."
"These are all matters which we constantly debate without ever finding a solution."
"We have to stop and think."
"It has been suggested today that it is clear that we should cooperate with the United States, as the USA is a power which is prepared to intervene at moments when the European Union will not sanction a military intervention, at least until it has its own military capability."
"We have to develop an approach."
"Perhaps it would help to send out mass information to the people in these countries to show them that opportunities for development exist other than those exercised against them by their regimes."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes and supports the thrust of the draft resolutions concerning the Human Rights situation in Iran."
"Our assessment is that serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the country during 2006."
"In fact, there has been no progress in the EU's main areas of concern, and in many respects the situation has worsened."
"The list of examples is long and grim: an increased use of the death penalty and the occurrence of juvenile executions continue to be of grave concern; ethnic and religious minorities continue to suffer from discrimination; the status of women remains poor; freedom of expression has been further curtailed; and the closure of newspapers, intimidation and prosecution of journalists and the clampdown on bloggers have all continued."
"The European Union has raised these concerns with the Iranian authorities during the past year, through both démarches and public statements."
"Unfortunately, as has been said in this House, it seems that the Iranian authorities are less willing than they have been in the past to take our requests into serious consideration or to make any tangible efforts to improve the situation."
"That said, some elements within the body politic, such as the Chief Judiciary, do appear somewhat committed to the cause of reform."
"However, given the overall deteriorating situation, the EU has decided to co-sponsor the Canadian resolution on the human rights situation in Iran in the UN Third Committee later this month."
"Since Tehran maintains that the bilateral human rights dialogue and UN-type resolutions are mutually exclusive, it has signalled that it would consider calling off the session of the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights, scheduled for December."
"We, of course, firmly reject any such link."
"We still aim to resume the dialogue shortly."
"We remain convinced that constructive dialogue, accompanied by cooperative projects both bilaterally and through UN agencies is the most realistic means to engage in the field of human rights."
"Mrs Prets has suggested that the Union should sponsor radio or television programmes."
"I am not competent to give an affirmative response to that, but as regards people-to-people contacts it is worth noting that one million Iranians visited Turkey in 2005."
"They went there in order to breathe some fresh air, watch 'The Bold and the Beautiful' and check out the benchmark of democracy in that troubled region."
"The crux of the matter in our relations with Iran is that, irrespective of positive or negative developments on the nuclear issue, which is extremely important, without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with that country cannot develop properly, no matter how much potential our relationship might otherwise have in terms of economic and energy cooperation."
"I wish to conclude by expressing my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Delegation for relations with Iran, chaired by Mrs Beer."
"I welcome your efforts to develop contacts with your interlocutors from the Majlis, as well as with the widest possible spectrum of Iranian society."
"The recent visit to this House by Mr Akbar Ganji - whose liberation we all worked tirelessly for - is an important case in point."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate)"

"Speaking times will have to conform to that timetable."
"I would like to begin by welcoming the Prime Minister of Ireland on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Taoiseach,"
"in a few weeks time, in the new year, our Parliament will adopt Irish as the twenty-first official language."
"In this multilingual House we will do everything we can to respect the commitments made in the Treaties and the rights of all languages to be used here."
"Our visitor today - the Irish Taoiseach - is someone who has been taking part in the European Council for a long time."
"He is one of the doyens of the European Council, having been a member since 1997 (nearly ten years ago)."
"He began as head of the Irish Government a few days after the Amsterdam European Council, which was the first failed attempt at a serious reform of the European institutions."
"He then lived through the Nice marathon, which led to a Treaty seen as unsatisfactory from an institutional point of view."
"That Treaty of Nice was rejected by the Irish people in a referendum in 2001."
"But the Irish Prime Minister took on the challenge of carrying out an intensive public information campaign and, as a result, in the second referendum held 18 months later, in 2002, Ireland approved the Treaty of Nice."
"The European Parliament was delighted and congratulated him enthusiastically."
"Then he held the Presidency of the European Council during the Intergovernmental Conference on the Constitutional Treaty, in June 2004."
"Those of us who sat in the Convention remember his pilgrimage to different European capitals in search of a delicate compromise that he achieved in the end."
"You, Prime Minister, have therefore been a privileged witness to our institutional quest."
"It is therefore a privilege to have you here with us and to hear your views on how the European Union can move beyond the impasse it is currently in."
"Furthermore, Ireland has developed an intense debate amongst its citizens."
"It has had a permanent forum for five years and this, at least, is one of the things we have gained from the 'no' vote in the referendums in certain countries: we have gone back to debating Europe, we have promoted the debate in civil society, and Ireland is probably the country that has done so in the most structured and permanent manner."
"You will remember that the Belgian Prime Minister was our guest in May and that this is the second guest to visit us in this innovative manner, since, as a rule, this House only receives Heads of State or Government who are holding the Presidency of the Council."
"The way we are receiving you today is innovative."
"You will have as much time as you need to explain your points of view to us and then there will be a first round of interventions with the Presidents of the political groups, to whom you may reply if you wish, and then we shall take speeches from other Members."
"Thank you very much for being here, Taoiseach."
"You have the floor."
"(Applause)"
"Prime Minister of Ireland."
"President Borrell, it is a great honour to be here again."
"I am very grateful for the invitation to exchange views on the future of Europe with all the Members of the European Parliament today."
"As someone who has spent more than half of my lifetime as a member of parliament, I cherish this renewed opportunity to address the only directly elected, multinational legislative body in the world."
"Since I last addressed you in 2004, the constructive influence of the European Parliament in advancing the concerns of Europe's citizens has continued to grow."
"Your vision is needed as we face the difficult challenges ahead."
"I wish you every success, Mr President, for the remainder of your term of office."
"I also wish your successor well."
"I wish you continued success and congratulate you on all that you have achieved."
"We look forward in particular to your visit to Dublin in the days ahead as part of the Forum for Europe, into which we have put an enormous amount of effort."
"I thank you for your kind remarks about the Forum for Europe."
"It is not a government body: it represents all the organisations in the country and it is hugely successful."
"You do us an enormous honour by coming to address it."
"Explaining Europe to the public remains probably our greatest challenge, at both European and national level."
"Therefore, Mr President, I particularly welcome and look forward to this discussion and to discussions with you in the days ahead."
"You will be visiting a country that has benefited enormously from its membership of the European Union."
"Some key facts stand out."
"Since we joined Europe in 1973, our national wealth stood at just 60 per cent of the European average at that stage."
"Even after accession, we were plagued by emigration, unemployment, high inflation and spiralling debt."
"These dismal conditions have been completely reversed in recent years."
"The role of the European Union was vital to all of that."
"Europe provided invaluable assistance to us at a critical period in our national development."
"The phrase 'the Future of Europe', like so many phrases, has become part of our jargon."
"But let us recall for a moment the significance of what those words 'the Future of Europe' really mean, for ourselves and for the wider world."
"For our own people in Europe, as we approach the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, it means consolidating and developing our extraordinary Union - a Union which has been so successful that many now take its success for granted."
"In a world which knows so much uncertainty, oppression, deprivation and violence, the Union is a bedrock of prosperity, stability and deep-rooted democracy."
"The very essence of the European Union - this powerful blend of pragmatism, of patience and vision - was captured by Robert Schuman when he observed that: 'Europe will not be made all at once, or according to one single plan: rather it will be formed by taking concrete measures which bring about real solidarity.'"
"Our Union is not, and must never become, an inward looking one."
"From 1 January we will be a Union of 27 with the very welcome accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"We will remain open to further enlargement in line with our commitments, our responsibilities and our principles."
"We also have growing responsibilities in relation to the wider international community."
"It is indeed a paradox that, at a time when we appear to be unsure internally of the precise direction which the future development of our Union should take, our role externally has never been more important or more clear."
"The wider world increasingly looks to Europe for leadership, for support and for the promotion of our values."
"The founding fathers of Europe would be proud to see the Europe of today - what we are and what we bring to our world."
"However, they would insist that our benchmark must be set not against where we have come from, but rather against what we must still achieve."
"Today Europe faces as great an array of challenges as ever, including globalisation, technological change, migration, energy security and terrorism."
"These challenges have not been dreamed up in Brussels or Strasbourg: they have risen up the Union's agenda because they are very real and directly relevant to all our citizens."
"The challenge must not only be met but also addressed in a way which reassures our citizens and responds to their anxieties and aspirations."
"The Union, in approaching these issues, is rightly pursuing two broad parallel tracks."
"In respect of both tracks, the role of the European Parliament will be crucial."
"On the one hand, we are continuing to reflect on the question of the constitutional treaty and we will return to it next June on the basis of a report by Chancellor Merkel."
"On the other hand, we are seeking to address the concerns of our citizens in practical ways under the existing Treaties."
"Both of these tracks are essential."
"We cannot put practical progress on hold; neither can we wish away the need to provide the Union with a coherent, streamlined basis for addressing the challenges of a new century."
"The constitutional treaty is designed to provide a much-needed basis for practical progress; and the practical progress we strive for will continue and contribute to a positive context for reaching agreement on the urgent institutional questions."
"I would like to address these two twin issues in turn."
"Nobody can predict with any certainty what the future holds for the constitutional treaty."
"There is, of course, no easy answer."
"I would, however, like to share with you briefly my own reflections and I look forward greatly to hearing your own perceptions in this afternoon's debate."
"A good starting point for trying to evaluate what lies ahead is often to reflect briefly on why and how we got to be where we are today."
"History is important because it can help us to make wise choices about the future."
"Since the Irish Presidency had the privilege of bringing the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations to a conclusion, I have a particular awareness of the processes which made that agreement possible."
"So let me start by recalling what seem to be three fundamental realities about the situation we have reached."
"First, it is important to remember that the constitutional treaty was agreed because it was necessary."
"The need for the substantive provisions has grown rather than diminished."
"We need its more coherent external policy to meet our growing international responsibilities."
"We need its subtle, balanced and effective provisions in the area of justice and home affairs to strengthen our fight against crime."
"We need its more open, comprehensible, democratic and effective procedures, including its significantly enhanced role for the European Parliament."
"We need its principles and its values."
"Moreover, apart from the constitutional treaty's specific elements, we need it because the long term stability, prosperity and coherence of Europe are of fundamental importance for our people as well as for people beyond our borders."
"Second, the process which led to the agreement of the constitutional treaty was long, complex and difficult."
"The Convention was unprecedented in its openness and achievement."
"The European Parliament was highly influential at the Convention, which also benefited greatly from the direct involvement of national parliaments."
"The subsequent IGC involved intensive bilateral and collective negotiations in which the views of each Member State, as well as of the Commission and Parliament, were taken very carefully into account."
"The process leading to agreement was a comprehensive and inclusive one."
"I visited every capital, as the President kindly recalled, and everyone was listened to and helped to shape the outcome."
"Third, participants were in the end able to accept the outcome of the negotiations because they saw it as a balanced overall package."
"The institutional provisions in particular were closely interrelated and formed a single whole."
"The difficulties of moving forward with the constitutional treaty are significant, but any analysis of what Europe needs, of how we got to where we are today and of the alternatives convince me that the right and realistic option is to return at the appropriate time to the substance and balance of the constitutional treaty."
"I understand that this is also broadly the view of this Parliament."
"In moving forward, we must ensure that the basis for progress must be an inclusive one in which the concerns and views of all are taken into account, including the legitimate concerns expressed by the citizens in many Member States."
"Chancellor Merkel will be consulting closely with each Member State and with the institutions."
"I have no doubt that her report to the June European Council will be soundly based and well judged."
"However, let me at this stage offer four reflections."
"First, we must continue to work to change the context in which we will return to consider the constitutional treaty."
"This means continuing to address, as effectively as we can, the concerns of our citizens on issues from employment to mobile phone charges, from enlargement to the fight against crime."
"That is what you, the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe, do so effectively week-in, week-out."
"Second, the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome next March offers an important opportunity to highlight for our citizens the achievements and potential of the Union."
"A succinct, consensual and eloquent declaration on that occasion, in the name of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, could represent a very positive element in creating a new context for our wider institutional debate and perhaps also in addressing some of the specific concerns which have arisen in the national debates on the constitutional treaty."
"Third, as was the case on previous occasions when European Treaties ran into difficulties at national level, additional elements could be introduced to address concerns that have arisen."
"Such additions could enrich rather than undermine the substance and balance of the Treaty."
"Fourth, the presentation, the length and, in some respects, the nature of the constitutional treaty could also be amended significantly without affecting its basic substance and balance."
"To give some examples, it could be brought out more clearly that what is involved is a treaty and that, in many respects, it essentially amends rather than replaces the existing Treaties."
"For the Irish Government's part, we remain resolutely and enthusiastically committed, as soon as the situation has been fully clarified, to holding a referendum on the substance of the constitutional treaty."
"The treaty remains important for Europe, for our people and for those who look to our values."
"As I said at the outset, it is essential that Europe also pursue the second track which we have set for ourselves, namely addressing, as best we can under the existing Treaties, the priorities of our citizens."
"I believe it is important to maintain broadly the distinctiveness of the two tracks."
"We should be wary of the selective advance application of elements which form part of the balance in the constitutional treaty."
"Let us not be unduly pessimistic about what we have achieved so far in terms of practical progress."
"The European economy is gaining in strength."
"More people are in work."
"An enlargement of historic proportions, which not long ago seemed unimaginable, has taken root and has greatly enriched our Union."
"But we are not here, at either European or national level, to congratulate ourselves."
"The successful football club is not the one that focuses on the trophy room: it is the one that focuses on the matches ahead."
"One only has to look at the agenda of any of your parliamentary sessions to appreciate the range and depth of the challenges we face."
"Time requires me to address what seem to be the strategic underlying challenges."
"Allow me to address briefly five of those challenges."
"First, there is the competitiveness challenge."
"This has many important European dimensions: better regulation, a strong and appropriate competition policy, research and development, the removal of barriers in the internal market, and perhaps above all innovation, in relation to which the proposed European institute for technology can make an important contribution."
"Our objective should be to make Europe attractive for investment."
"I have repeatedly stressed to my colleagues in the European Council and to the Commission that Europe is increasingly in competition not within itself but with other parts of the world, notably Asia."
"The reality of this competition must give urgency as well as direction to the development and implementation of policies at European level."
"Our second strategic objective should be to ensure that achieving competitiveness does not threaten the European social model, and that competitiveness and social inclusion are partners, not rivals."
"This is the key principle underpinning our own national system of social partnership."
"Our experience of extensive and intensive social dialogue has delivered 18 consecutive years of economic growth, improved living standards and greater social inclusion."
"In our approach at European level, including where appropriate through legislation, we should reflect the principle that economic and social policies can and should be mutually reinforcing."
"We must, above all, ensure that solidarity and opportunity are at the heart of the Union and must drive Europe's future."
"The test of Europe's credibility today is whether it can deliver policies which build up solidarity within the European Union and secure opportunities for all our people."
"I also strongly believe that we need to give greater substance to the social dialogue at European level."
"At both European and national level, we must engage the social partners, in particular the trade unions, in a real debate on the reform of the European social model and on the modernisation of labour markets."
"Our third strategic challenge is to confront the downsides of globalisation, including cross-border crime, human trafficking, illegal migration, and the scourge of illicit drugs that ruin so many lives."
"We know about the potential for pollution to trigger calamitous climate change."
"Of course, the responsibility in many of these areas falls significantly on the Member States. But as long as our climate and our criminals do not stop at the borders between our countries, we must work together to ensure all appropriate action at European level."
"Fourth, Europe must play its full role across the range of its external competences."
"I shall not dwell on this further because I have already highlighted in my introduction the increasingly important role which the Union plays and is expected to play in the international arena."
"It is, of course, essential that Europe is adequately funded, including in the CFSP area, for addressing its growing responsibilities in the western Balkans, in our wider neighbourhood and further afield, especially towards the poorest who need our support and to whom Europe should continue to strive to be a special friend."
"The fifth, and perhaps greatest strategic challenge is - I am sure you would agree - to connect Europe better with its citizens."
"Of course, this challenge is not unrelated to the other challenges."
"We can only communicate a positive message if we have a positive message to communicate."
"But we have to demonstrate clearly that Europe is part of the solution to globalisation, not part of the problem."
"We have to show that the European social model remains at the heart of increased competitiveness."
"Our people must not only be secure but also feel secure."
"We need to act, but we also need to explain what Europe is doing and can do to provide security for our citizens."
"We have to bring home much more effectively to the public that, through our external policies, we are increasingly and effectively promoting their interests, their priorities and their values."
"I fully accept that a large part of the responsibility of explaining Europe accurately and fairly falls at national level."
"It is certainly a priority for my Government."
"Respect for diversity can play a particularly important part in connecting the Union with its citizens."
"I thank you, Mr President, for announcing that today is the first day that Irish will be used and that from 1 January 2007 it will become the 21st language of the European Union."
"(GA) Nothing could illustrate better the respect which Europe has for the individual character of its Member States than the improved status which Irish will have from 1 January."
"Ireland is very grateful to Parliament for your support in introducing the new provisions."
"Allow me, in conclusion, to say that we should not lose sight of the fact that at the heart of our Europe, when it was founded half a century ago, was the determination to bring permanent peace 'among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts', as the first Treaty put it."
"The Union has been resoundingly successful in that aim within our borders."
"The Union is also an increasingly important factor for stability beyond our borders."
"I would like to pay particular tribute to the fact that the European Union has played a crucial role in relation to our peace process in Northern Ireland."
"The Union has provided not just generous financial support, but also a context and an example."
"I would like to convey to you today the deep-felt appreciation of the Irish people for Parliament's valued, consistent and continuing support for peace on the island of Ireland."
"In the second half of the 21st century, another generation of Europeans will be living with the consequences of the decisions we take."
"I hope that, when they cast an eye back to our generation of Europeans, they will be able to conclude that we had the imagination, courage and intelligence to consolidate our unique Union and to provide a solid, comprehensive and consensual basis for taking forward its achievements."
"It is an honour to be here, Mr President, and I thank you."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Taoiseach Ahern."
"There will now be speeches on behalf of the groups."
"Before giving them the floor, I would like to point out that two of them - Mr Schulz and Mr Watson - have today been re-elected Presidents of their political groups, and I would therefore like to congratulate them."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, It is wonderful, Mr President, how we complement one another."
"I, too, was on the point of expressing congratulations, but I shall start with you first, and congratulate you on your election, by European Voice yesterday, as the 2006 MEP of the Year; well done!"
"I also want to congratulate Mr Schulz and Mr Watson on their re-elections; being a group chairman myself, I know, of course, just how much that means to them."
"I have just heard that Mr Cohn-Bendit has also been re-elected, and I assume that Mrs Frassoni has been as well, so warm congratulations to them too."
"(Applause)"
"It is always a pleasant experience for group chairmen to get their mandate renewed for another two and a half years;"
"I cannot, at present, say what my fate is going to be, but I rejoice all the more in the re-election of my counterparts."
"In what you have said, Prime Minister, we hear the good European voice of Ireland, and what you said, you said not only because Ireland has done so well from the European Union, but as a convinced European, and that has always been the good experience we have had with Ireland."
"Whether it is your political family that is in power or our own - the last of your Prime Ministers from ours was John Bruton, who is now our ambassador in Washington - Ireland's profound commitment to European integration is manifest, and your speech today made that clear once more."
"We rejoice and are glad that you are here today."
"We now have to think about the future of Europe, and Prime Minister Ahern mentioned 25 March, which marks fifty years of the Treaties of Rome."
"I see the Berlin statement - a joint statement by the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission - as a good opportunity to tell the citizens of the European Union that we, the European institutions - even though our opinions may well differ on one thing or another - are united in our determination to lead the European Union into a bright future."
"If we managed to achieve that in Berlin, we will have put down a significant political and psychological marker for the summit at the end of June, at which, firstly, a decision is to be taken on what is to be done next about the constitutional treaty, and, secondly, on what mandate we are to give the conference that is to consider that."
"Speaking on behalf of our group, and in particular of the PPE element in it, I can say that we do of course insist on this House participating in any such conference - effectively, powerfully, and efficiently - and we ask, Prime Minister, for your support in this."
"We hope that will go ahead at the end of June and that we will be able to decide, under Portuguese and Slovene Presidency, what is to become of the constitutional treaty."
"I would like to make it quite clear, speaking on behalf of our group, and particularly of the European People's Party element in it, that we do not want to start again from the very beginning - it would be quite wrong to talk in terms of 'new negotiations' - but want as much as possible of the substance of the constitutional treaty to be retained, particularly as regards the reforms in Part 1 and the section dealing with values in the Charter."
"One reason for that is that we are convinced that we need these values."
"The European Union has no future unless it is founded upon values."
"Another consideration is that we have to equip the European Union to face the challenges that are ahead, not only in its internal policies but also in its dealings with the outside world."
"We need to invigorate and strengthen the European Union, to make it more democratic, more effective and more transparent."
"You have affirmed your belief in that, and for that we are grateful to you."
"If we go down this road together, we will share in success."
"Thank you for your time, Mr Poettering."
"When I congratulated Mr Schulz and Mr Watson, I had not been told that Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mrs Frassoni had also been elected co-Presidents of their groups; I too would like to congratulate them."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the congratulations;"
"I, in my turn, want to congratulate all those who have been elected, irrespective of to what, but I want, for the moment, to focus on Mr Ahern's speech."
"I think it is good that Mr Ahern has come to this House;"
"I am grateful to him for being here, for the fact is that it is not the most obvious thing to do."
"Not all his colleagues in the European Council can manage to summon up the nerve to come here and affirm their belief in Europe."
"I want to make it clear that I think the Heads of Government who are publicly backing the European project deserve credit for coming here and saying that, whatever difficulties they face, they are standing up for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"The fact is that there are too many of them who come here, who do not make their presence felt, who avoid this House and stop off perhaps only to collect some money from this or that European fund to take back home, where they will say that Europe is the problem!"
"There are too many of their kind around."
"What we need are men and women who are in positions of leadership in Europe - be it in the Member States or in the European institutions - and who openly affirm their commitment to this project, and that, Mr Ahern, is why I have to start by thanking you for being here."
"Let me make a second comment on the substance of your speech."
"One can say 'yes' to absolutely everything in it, Prime Minister; the five priorities that you set out, the conviction that Ireland is in favour of the Constitution as a matter of principle, your desire to retain what is at the heart of it, your warning to us not to abandon that, for its essential content is the foundation for Europe's future - all these things are marvellous, but all that is missing is Ireland's ratification of it, so I urge you to summon up your courage and do that; if your speech today is a cake, that would be the icing on it."
"I do not, however, want to demand too much of you, for you have at least taken the right step in the right direction, and even if Ireland were to ratify now, that would get us little further down the road, but, in any case, nineteen out of twenty-seven states would then have ratified it, and the fact that eighteen already have done so or are about to do so means that we can and must take note that the majority of the Member States of the European Union want what is in the Constitution, while those who do not are in the minority."
"It is, I think, permissible to say that it is this minority that has to give way."
"It is not acceptable that we should all be debating the future of Europe, while those who said 'no' think it is nothing to do with them, so the Dutch, and the French too, must get into step in a future process on the basis of a document to which the overwhelming majority of Member States have said 'yes'!"
"I believe that, if we do not move too far from this document, if we really can retain that which it contains, we will be saving the President of the Commission from having to run around like a water diviner in search of portfolios for his Commissioners."
"If you need proof that Nice does not work and that we need the Constitution as a matter of urgency, then what we see happening with the Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania is it."
"Many thanks, then, Mr Ahern; as we journey towards a renewed constitution, we need you, and we thank you for your encouraging speech."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as Commissioner Wallström's research - presented to one of our committees last week - has revealed, there is at least as much a communication crisis in the European Union as a constitutional crisis."
"We risk slowly but inexorably losing the confidence and trust of our citizens by our collective failure to respond to their concerns and our inability to frame a coherent and acceptable response."
"Those concerns are many and varied, but to my mind they hinge around responses to the challenges of the world in which we live."
"We witness rapid world population growth, even though it is declining here, and failure to share equitably the fruits of our endeavours or the benefits of modernity."
"As a result, many vote with their feet."
"We are creating a global economy without forging a comparable global social contract."
"We face a major challenge, as the Prime Minister mentioned, from internationally organised crime, with some criminal gangs now more powerful than some national governments."
"Yet the Union seems more geared to solving yesterday's problems than today's or tomorrow's."
"The tools to solve these problems are at our disposal in a common foreign and security policy and a justice and home affairs policy, but they lie unemployed."
"The irony is that the Constitution as it emerged from the Convention probably met most critics' concerns."
"Unfortunately, Europe's political class failed to explain this, for which we all share responsibility."
"We left the field open to the Constitution's detractors and there is little sign yet that France will have a more serene or informed debate on its place in Europe in the run-up to next May's elections, or that the Netherlands, emerging from elections last week, has really made up its mind."
"It would be too easy to conclude that the victory for the anti-European parties is confirmation that we got it wrong, but we need the Prime Ministers of those two countries to come here to explain to us how they see the way forward."
"In Poland there is denial, and from across the English Channel an eerie silence reflecting relief and embarrassment in near equal measure."
"I hope the Germans can relaunch the debate."
"I applaud Angela Merkel's determination to do this, but I suspect she will find it extremely difficult within the period of the German Presidency."
"This is where Ireland can play such an important part, Prime Minister, not only because of the role you played in the Convention, or your experience of adverse referendum, but because of Ireland's role in looking for what you called a return to the balance and the substance of the constitutional treaty, and in working together with Portugal and Slovenia."
"Go out and build a coalition of smaller countries that know how important it is to respond to the challenges of globalisation."
"Go out and build a coalition of the political forces which, in response to the challenges of globalisation, recognise that we need to keep the drawbridge down rather than pull it up."
"We have to show our citizens that the European Union can work on energy policy, on issues like mobile phone roaming charges, and in particular on justice and home affairs."
"We can do that with the existing Treaties by use of the passerelle clause."
"By any objective standards our Union is a great success."
"Therefore, think less about changes to the Constitution and more about building the collective courage to go out and persuade people why it is necessary."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Ahern, re-election puts one in a good mood; perhaps that is the reason why my group has asked me to speak today, so that I might not be a mild-mannered group chairman."
"I do, of course, Prime Minister, welcome you warmly on behalf of our group; thank you for coming."
"As you said, nobody knows what the future has in store for the constitutional treaty."
"I must admit that I would be happier if I definitely knew what the governments had in store for it; one and a half years' break for reflection and thinking, one and a half years, already extended by a year, and what has come out of it?"
"I can neither see nor hear anyone thinking, and nobody is talking to us, although you have today, and you are one of the few."
"We will perhaps return to your proposals, but what - over these eighteen months - has actually been thought or clarified?"
"The great and good are not asking what lies behind this crisis; they do not want to know what motivated those who, in France and the Netherlands, said 'no', or about the disappointed expectation of the public, and just why it is that the public have been so systematically disappointed."
"Nor are they asking about new ways forward, about new exit routes from this crisis."
"Where, in fact, is any thought being given to that?"
"I do not see much real cause for hope in a new beginning under the German Presidency of the Council."
"I have been an observer of this since it all started."
"What brought about this constitution-making process was not insight or idealism; nor were the Heads of Government inspired by a vision to embark upon it."
"What did it was the lamentable fact that Amsterdam was a failure, that Nice was an outright disaster, that there was a massive crisis of confidence among all Europe's peoples."
"It was the fact that this Union was up against a brick wall; the fact that it was, quite simply, impotent."
"Then, of course, there was the double 'no'."
"One ought to look into the reasons for it."
"What astonishes me is that politicians like opinion polls, and I have never heard of anyone who would shy away from quoting a good one."
"Eurobarometer ran very comprehensive and good surveys following the French and Dutch votes into the reasons for them, and into the public's expectations, and - I am not going to talk about the people who voted 'yes' in what are now eighteen Member States with a massive majority of the people and states of Europe, but about the 62% of Dutch people and 65% of French people who said 'no' - well, they also said: 'yes, we want a European constitution; we want it to be revised' and they even said what they wanted this to achieve, namely more powers for the Union in social matters."
"I have never heard a member of a government reflect on that."
"What you said today leaves me quite astonished."
"In essence, what you say boils down to two familiar proposals: a treaty instead of a constitution."
"I have to tell you, Prime Minister, that it was only the governments - and not the people of Europe - who were irritated by the idea that this political community should be endowed with a constitution."
"Forcing through the actual policies in the way you propose will fail, precisely because of this crisis of confidence in Europe, this crisis of European democracy."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Ahern, it was with some excitement that I listened to your speech."
"I think we have reached a point that could easily be defined as the 'point of no future' if we were working on the basis of 'business as usual'."
"While Mr Ahern was quite clear in making the future of Europe dependent on what becomes of a constitutional treaty for the European Union, that does, however, presuppose that there has to be a long-term discussion process with that Union's citizens."
"There are more reasons than those already - and repeatedly - adduced for why people are afraid that this European Union will be unable to offer them a future."
"I do not see the text as submitted as providing any answers to a dichotomy that is, alas, all too often put to one side, for, although we have defined what wealth has been brought into this European Union of ours by way of every kind of people and nation - namely their highly diverse cultural identities - we have not, however, managed to define what we, together, are going to do with all this wealth."
"It is one thing to ask what we bring with us, but considering what we are to do with it, how a shared political identity can be fashioned out of it, is a process that cannot be run as a sideline and certainly not on the basis of people being told the same thing over and over again, that being that they have not yet understood what good we are trying to do."
"That is why I think that we have to take on board people's day-to-day experiences of the European Union and make actual policies that have to do with their future and their present, on the basis of them."
"This is particularly true in relation to the issue of a social European Union, the neglect of which to date has been positively criminal."
"There is, in fact, no point in us discussing this or that while people experience the precise opposite, as we have seen from the debate in Brussels about the Volkswagen workers, and in assorted other areas too."
"The unfortunate fact is that, in the day-to-day lives of many, the European Union's presence is felt in the shape of decreasing job security and less social security, and that is not going to get people engaging with these processes and affirming their belief in them, even though that is precisely what we need, and I think we should have more discussion of how we create the conditions in which cultural identities can develop into shared political identities and into a civic identity for the European Union."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, it is a great honour for me to extend a warm welcome to the Taoiseach here to the European Parliament today."
"Your visit shows your understanding of the important work of the European Parliament and the need for the European Union to find a solution to the constitutional difficulties which the Union is experiencing at present."
"There are increasing difficulties within the European Union, not only on the Constitution but also, as other colleagues have mentioned, regarding globalisation, economic development and the common foreign and security policy."
"The Taoiseach has given us a great vision today, not just through his words but also because of the experience he brings with him."
"In nearly ten years in the European Council he has seen many leaders come and go, but he has also seen many of the crises that people previously thought would rent the European Union apart and found solutions for them, in particular concerning the agreement on the constitutional treaty."
"There is no point going over what should or should not have been."
"It is now up to the Member States in their period of reflection to present ideas as regards what should be brought forward."
"Not just because we need a new treaty, or a new set of rules, but because we need to continue to demonstrate a vision to those countries on our borders which aspire to become part of the European Union and look to it as a model of peace, prosperity and stability."
"I am thinking in particular of the countries in the Balkans."
"We held out a candle of hope to them and, unfortunately, because we can no longer accommodate a further enlargement, that candle of hope could be extinguished, just when they are beginning to grow economically and find a new way forward in political and democratic terms."
"With regard to globalisation, our main focus should be on making the European economy better able to deal with the situation in the 21st century."
"This requires greater investment in research and development, greater use of innovation and technology and, I must stress, greater collaboration between universities and research institutes in the European Union through the European institute of technology."
"Finally, I should like to tell the Taoiseach that it rests on him as the leader of one country to present that vision."
"He spoke about the peace process in Northern Ireland and the importance of the European Union's role in that regard, not only in economic and financial terms but also in the model and vision it provided."
"We must find a new Europe for the 21st century, where everybody can belong to that commonality."
"But all groups must be sure that the diversity within the European Union today, and beyond it on the European continent, is respected in a process for collaboration and collective agreement rather than for domination."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Taoiseach here for an honest discussion about the future of Europe, but, as I was once told when asking for directions, I would not start from here."
"Taoiseach, your government has cultivated Ireland's image in Europe as a success story, the once poor nation made good, but this House deserves to know what lies behind this so-called success."
"As the Irish know, Ireland is now open for business, but closed for people."
"We spend freely to lure the market but cut every corner in social spending."
"It is this mentality that has lengthened waiting times for vital hospital procedures to months instead of days."
"It has also seen families of children with disabilities badly treated, like the O'Cuanachains, hounded through the courts at a cost of millions just this year instead of their five-year-old child being given an appropriate education."
"This is also the mindset which makes our Environmental Protection Agency a rubber stamp of approval for even the dirtiest business, no matter how damaging it is to the environment; a mindset that opens Ireland to toxic industries like incineration, which Irish people do not want."
"You also seem to believe that the mental health and suicide problem, which grows with our economic success, is a mere inconvenience and not a tragedy that our country has never really addressed."
"Similarly, there are tens of thousands of unpaid carers whom we should be supporting for the valuable work they are doing, but whom your government treats like Oliver Twist asking for more."
"Why, Taoiseach, has your government destroyed our sugar industry for an EU scheme, when Irish agriculture is struggling for survival and when we need biofuels like ethanol?"
"Why did your government vote to allow EU funding for embryo-destructive research, when our people have always cherished the most vulnerable citizens?"
"Finally, Taoiseach, why have you come here propositioning us with a dead Constitution that the Irish do not want."
"We already have a truly great Constitution, for which Irish men and women laid down their lives, a Constitution which gives us a genuine foundation for real and respectful cooperation with our European neighbours."
"Ireland is a great country with amazing people."
"They certainly deserve better and I think you will finally discover this when you put the Constitution, or whatever you decide to call it, to a referendum."
"Mr President, to what do we owe the visit by the Irish Prime Minister today?"
"Could it be connected to the upcoming Irish election, to allow Mr Ahern to be seen back home as a statesman on the European scene?"
"One wonders!"
"The last time Mr Ahern was here at the end of the Irish Council Presidency, he was celebrating having overseen an agreement between the Heads of Governments on the EU Constitution."
"He readily basked in the adulation of Europhile fanatics in this House."
"By now, November 2006, he and they assured us that the EU Constitution would be in full operation."
"But, as often happens, they reckoned without the most important component of democratic politics: the views of the people."
"As the Constitution floundered on the rocks of rejection in France and Holland, Mr Ahern - though an avowed Euro-enthusiast - and my government in the United Kingdom lost their nerve and hurriedly abandoned the prospect of giving the people of the British Isles a chance to give their verdict by postponing the referenda, because they were fearful of the result."
"Now he returns to tell us again of the marvels of European integration and that the rejected Constitution must be revived."
"It seems to me that it is a stale message about a moribund Constitution from one who may well soon be judged by his own electorate to be a stale politician."
"Mr President, I shall try to deal quickly with the issues."
"I want to thank everybody for their welcome - I did not detect that from the last speaker, but from everybody else anyway!"
"(Laughter)"
"I want to thank Mr Poettering for his remarks."
"The European Parliament's participation in the IGC during the Irish Presidency was extremely important and constructive."
"The European Parliament was clearly very much part of it and it clearly should be involved in taking the process forward."
"I think that is what you requested, and you certainly have my support in that."
"I thank you for your remarks about the declaration in Berlin."
"I support you."
"Your issue about the reforms of Part I and the values and getting ourselves ready for the challenges in the future are all things that I readily agree with."
"Mr Schulz spoke about the five priorities based on the future of Europe and the ratification process."
"Ireland would have preferred it if everyone had ratified it at the same time, as that would have resolved a lot of problems without all the debate."
"We have to remember that there are 16 or 17 countries that are committed to ratifying the Constitution: the majority of the parties, particularly the three large parties in our Parliament have clearly stated their support for it."
"We believe that there must be some clarity."
"Unlike other countries, because of our written Constitution, whatever happens we always have to have a referendum."
"We do not just want to be putting words out that we know will change in some format because whatever happens, it will be entered into our Constitution."
"We have to have certainty in that, but there is certainly no fear of us having referendums."
"Mr Watson brought up the concerns of citizens and the global contract."
"The big issue for that is for countries to show their support."
"You mentioned the issues of JHA being consistent with the Treaties that are already there, dealing with issues of crime and the common foreign and security policy."
"The biggest way we can show the developing countries our support is through our commitment under the UN to ODA."
"That is what I try to practise, because you can talk all you like, but you have to be prepared to put your money into it."
"For us as a small country, getting to 0.7 per cent is the small matter of EUR 1.5 billion!"
"That is a lot in our budget, but we are moving towards that fast, and we are doing that to help not only our own people but also the less well-of in various parts of the world."
"I agree that if Chancellor Merkel can get the balance and substance right, it would mean amendments."
"We accept that and we can move forward."
"Mr Voggenhuber was right that a reflection of one and a half years has not brought us very far."
"I accept that point."
"However, neither have we gone back."
"We are here in a reflection period and we must find a way forward."
"Not everyone will agree, but I and 17 or 18 countries believe in the balance and substance of the constitutional treaty, with some amendments if it means accommodating France and the Netherlands - which we accept is the right thing to do."
"Ultimately we will have to do that and get the institutional balance right and find a way forward."
"It is not just some theoretical pro-European issue, it is to make the functioning of Europe correct for the future so that we can continue with our environmental and economic progress and our common foreign and security policy."
"That is why we negotiated a treaty."
"However, I accept your point: 13 months on is a long time, but there are still reasons for voting."
"We shall have to deal with those reasons."
"The reasons why we need a Union that can continually cater for new members - now 27 and in a few years' time possibly 30 - and our new neighbourhood policy were outlined in the Nice and Amsterdam Treaties."
"We do not have the institutional changes and the balances that can cater for that."
"That was the whole project, and the European Parliament was as strong an advocate for that as anyone."
"Mrs Zimmer asked about a common EU identity and social dialogue."
"From the time I entered political life in the 1972 referendum in Ireland I have always believed that social dialogue was absolutely essential to Ireland's future."
"Ireland has succeeded and no longer has the high unemployment of 17 or 18% of the past, when the annual emigration equalled the entire labour market growth of the country; when our exports were in decline and economic growth was negative; when we had no money for the less well off in our society."
"That was when we did not have social dialogue."
"Economic performance and dealing with the agenda on competitiveness and social policy are mutual friends and they can work in harmony - they are not exclusive policies."
"It is when they work together."
"With respect, I never quite understand when people are arguing the issue on Europe why we always forget all the positives."
"That applies to members of the European Council - I would accept that criticism - and I think it applies to Members of the European Parliament."
"However, look at what has been achieved because of the strength of Europe."
"Look at the equality agenda."
"Look at the health and safety agenda."
"Look at the welfare agenda."
"Look at the mobility of workers."
"Would any of these have been here if this institution had not been here, if Europe had not been here?"
"Not a hope in hell!"
"Europe has achieved this."
"So to talk against your own achievements is never a good idea, in my view."
"Europe has achieved all these things and the chance of our harmonising, getting stronger environmental laws, more cooperation and helping less developed countries - all these are European policies that never would have happened otherwise."
"Europe has pulled Ireland and other countries up and it has applied pressure, it has fined and prosecuted people."
"However, the fact is that the citizens have gained from every one of those issues."
"I would say to my good colleague, Mrs Sinnott, that the reason we have progressive disabilities legislation, the reason that we are putting huge resources into disability, the reason we have an Environmental Protection Agency, the reason we have far greater health policy, the reason we are able to support these things, is not because there is any difference between the 1937 Constitution - which treasures all the people and children of Ireland equally - and what we have today."
"It is because we have been able to make progress because Europe has progressed."
"I think these are great issues."
"I am delighted to see Mr Allister here."
"His party has moved forward progressively."
"It has moved away from the past, even if not all of its members have, including himself."
"However, we are moving on, we are making progress."
"I will deal with my electorate and I wish you well in your February election, too."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much."
"It is inevitable that our debates should always have a national component."
"Various Members will now speak."
"Mr President, as leader of the Fine Gael delegation in the largest and most influential group in the European Parliament, the PPE-DE Group, and on behalf of my colleagues Mr Coveney, Mr Higgins, Mrs McGuinness and Mr Mitchell, I have great pleasure in joining in the welcome to the Taoiseach today as the Prime Minister of our esteemed republic (notwithstanding the politically-hyped and inaccurate reports to the contrary in recent times)."
"We are Irish, Taoiseach, and as such we are European."
"Our ancestors, the Celts, lived, thrived and established settlements throughout the European continent, from the shores of the Mediterranean to the peaks of the Alps, from the plains of Romania to the Atlantic coast, and, like many recent new arrivals in our own country, we migrated here to the continent seeking asylum from war, disease and over-population, seeking economic opportunity."
"Over the subsequent centuries, Vikings, Saxons, Anglo-Normans, Jews, English, Scots, Spaniards, French Huguenots and many other races came, saw and intermarried with the Celts."
"The modern day Irish you see around you at home, and indeed around here today, are the result of this genetic soup of different European races."
"The history of Ireland and that of mainland Europe are inextricably linked."
"The Irish monks travelled throughout Europe establishing Christian monasteries in such far-flung places as Iceland and Ukraine."
"Our cultural and political links with Spain and France lasted for centuries, throughout the time when we were ruled by the British Crown."
"Many Irish battalions served in the armies of the great European powers down the years."
"Our very Constitution makes reference to our gallant allies in Europe."
"And yet, for some reason during the past decade, an apathy, an ignorance about Europe or the European project has seeped into the Irish society, into European society."
"Europe has become associated with Brussels and viewed from the Member State perspective as a place far away, with little relevance to the day-to-day lives of our citizens."
"I believe that the rationale for the European project which rose out of the ashes of the Second World War, its very raison d'être, has never been fully explained or understood."
"Yes, Europe's political class, as another colleague said, continues to fail to explain the project and claims all the credit for itself at national level instead of acknowledging the European Union's role."
"It is only since we joined the European Union that Ireland has become truly independent."
"Culturally and psychologically, membership of the Union has broadened our horizons and encouraged us to look outwards."
"Ireland's success in leaving behind the oppressive legacy of colonialism and building the new relationship with the UK, which has underpinned the Northern Ireland peace process, must be seen as a significant part of modern European history paralleling the fundamental rapprochement between France and Germany."
"I admire Ireland's membership of and contribution to the Union."
"I look around me at home and I see a confident, pluralistic society far removed from the introspective, sectarian Ireland in which our parents and grandparents were raised."
"Europe has helped define our place in the wider world."
"I salute the Taoiseach's Presidency of Europe and his particular contribution towards the finality of the Convention and the wonderful work being done by the Forum on Europe under the chairmanship of Maurice Hayes at home at the moment."
"(GA) Thank you all very much."
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome the Taoiseach."
"It is extremely important that you are willing, Mr Taoiseach, to discuss matters pertaining to the future of Europe with us."
"We all understand that the population of Europe is concerned."
"It is not easy to arrive at a solution to the problems which are the basis of that concern."
"I welcome your commitment to the substance of the constitutional text."
"However, Member States and the Council are currently denying Europeans the accountable, democratic, and socially engaged Europe they want."
"Why, Taoiseach, are you and other Heads of Government blocking key social directives on ferry crews, working time, migration and temporary work agencies?"
"Will you now help unblock all of these, as a means of rebuilding Europeans' confidence in Europe?"
"The Constitution must not be filleted."
"A mini-treaty will give us a mini-Europe, when we need a strong, democratic Europe capable of coping with the global challenges we all face."
"The most democratic way forward is to negotiate legally-binding protocols to address the concerns raised by the pro-European French and Dutch electorates."
"Such an approach would reassure those pro-Europeans who voted 'no', would not oblige those who have already ratified to reopen the issue and would make it more likely that those yet to ratify, such as Ireland, can do so."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, it is unfortunate that not more Dutch people are taking part in this debate, because the Netherlands rejected the Constitution last year, and all the parties that were opposed to this Constitution achieved huge gains in the elections last week."
"We do not yet know what form the coalition will take, but I hope that the Netherlands will once again show the ambition and vision to which Europe was accustomed from us, instead of constantly putting our foot on the brake, because Europe must, as a matter of urgency, be reformed."
"Since the veto has a paralysing effect in the area of security, Member States increasingly resort to informal arrangements, thereby ducking both national and European parliamentary control in a kind of parallel, opaque and undemocratic decision-making structure."
"Vetoes can also be abolished without the Constitution, for example in the area of police and judicial cooperation."
"Without the Constitution, Council meetings can be completely out in the open and attention can be devoted to citizens' initiatives that are backed up by a million signatures."
"The Europe of the governments and diplomats has reached its limits."
"It is therefore more logical to look for a solution in a public debate, for example in the Convention, rather than in closed negotiations between ministers and Heads of Government."
"That is how we also avoid blockades by individual countries."
"Prime Minister Ahern is probably right in saying that it is better to improve the Constitution by adding bits to it rather than by reducing it to its bare bones."
"He is also right to say that simultaneous ratification across Europe would be much better than national procedures."
"The highest priority, though, must be the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The European fundamental rights are the beating heart, the very soul, of our community, and Europe will not exist unless it has a soul."
"I therefore endorse what Prime Minister Ahern had to say."
"(DE) Mr President, as you can see, my group has organised a collection of speaking time today, so what you are getting is a speech in instalments - European rhetoric, new style."
"As I said earlier, Prime Minister, we have had a two-year period of reflection in which there has been no reflection, any more than we have had the loudly-trumpeted debate with the European public."
"The Commission's 'Plan D' exists on paper and nowhere else."
"Even though I hear all the promises from the governments, who never tire of telling us about their plans for rescuing the constitution, if I listen very carefully, I am reminded of the Trojan Horse, in that, if you put your ear to the wooden horse, you hear the clink of weapons and become aware that it exists with quite different purposes in mind, things that have absolutely nothing to do with what we have been, for years, hearing and discussing in the European public square, or with what I see as being the causes of this crisis."
"What do we hear from the governments?"
"We hear that they are putting a treaty together!"
"Well, an international organisation really is the last thing that we need."
"It is not the sort of political community that will defeat nationalism."
"In actual practice, Europe always loses out from any such balance between it and nationalism."
"The public want a constitution because they can see that it is about a political community, and because what they had been promised was the political unification of Europe, the political unification of this continent."
"What we get instead is more talk of a treaty."
"You also, today, promised us even more competition."
"Never - in the Netherlands, in France, or anywhere else in Europe, at hundreds of debates and events - have I heard calls for more competition."
"'More competition' is something demanded only by the elites, by the neoliberals, and by governments."
"Let me tell you, speaking as one who has been given the chance to pick up what the people are saying, that what we need is a balance between economic and political integration, in the shape of a social Union."
"How often do you propose - through your intergovernmental, self-aggrandising management of the Lisbon process - to report to the public that it has yielded nothing?"
"That is what the public demand to know."
"What has become of the governments' dialogue on a social Union, on putting an end to tax dumping and social dumping in Europe?"
"That is what the public want to know."
"You talk about a sense of security; now that, if you do not mind, is what I call populism, for appealing to security always presses the right buttons, but not a word has been said about the Charter of Fundamental Rights for months, not even about parliamentary monitoring, as shown by the CIA abductions and the failure to explain just how and to what extent European governments helped it with them."
"Nothing is being said about the enhancement of Parliament's functions, about a Charter of Fundamental Rights enforceable at law, or about the protection of the public - yet that is what the public themselves are talking about!"
"From deep within the Trojan Horse, I keep on hearing other things, like talk of military cooperation - security again - but nothing whatever about a common, democratic, autonomous foreign policy, about playing a responsible role both globally and within the WTO, a role defending a fair system of global trade and putting development policy on a completely different level."
"I get the feeling that, in amidst this crisis, the ordinary citizen has been lost from sight."
"The governments, in the armour and costume of knights, have reappeared before us and are blocking Europe's way."
"(GA) Mr President, I would like to welcome the Taoiseach here today."
"I am very pleased that the Taoiseach is addressing today's plenary session."
"The European Union is in a phase of transition, continued expansion, new cultures, new ideas and new challenges."
"The important question is how to meet these challenges."
"Is it through a race to the bottom, as evidenced in Ireland during the Irish ferries dispute last year and repeated many times since, or is it by ensuring that we are at the fore in demanding the highest standards regarding rights, reform of bureaucratic EU structures and a political programme that truly puts the people of the European Union first?"
"We must promote a Europe that seeks to protect the most vulnerable, particularly the 65 million living in poverty across the Union."
"Taoiseach, we must do the same in Ireland, and this means succeeding in our peace process, ending partition, building strong public services and promoting equality in every aspect of life."
"I believe that we can meet all these challenges, but only if there is real political will: a will to radically alter the EU's current and future priorities."
"This is not a matter of presentational nuance."
"It is a matter of substance."
"I would ask you, Taoiseach, and other EU leaders to truly listen to people across the EU and to respond to their needs."
"This can be best done by defending workers' rights, protecting public services and halting the drive towards a militarised and fortressed European Union."
"We in Sinn Féin, and our colleagues in the GUE/NGL Group, are committed to ensuring that the future of Europe is based on principles of democracy, equality and solidarity."
"(GA) Mr President, I extend a warm welcome to the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to the European Parliament."
"I am delighted to hear him speaking about the future of Europe in Parliament today in our own native language, Irish."
"This is a symbolic step as Irish will very shortly be an official working language at Institutional level in Europe."
"The Taoiseach is greatly to be praised for his efforts to influence the Council of Europe and the various governments, to ensure their support for his proposal: to upgrade Irish at European level."
"Romania and Bulgaria, who are poised to gain representation at the level of the European Commission, made a comprehensive presentation in Parliament this week."
"I fully support the decision of José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, to give the responsibilities for multilingualism to Leonard Orban, Romania's nominated Commissioner."
"We all know that Europe is hanging in the balance at present as regards reform and greater efficiency of Institutional procedure."
"I believe that modern Institutional procedure will strengthen the role of the European Union and ensure that the Union is able to speak, able to address economic challenges which face many of the Member States at present."
"Germany will assume Presidency of the Union on New Year's Day next year, God willing."
"President Merkel has already indicated that she intends to address the difficulties concerning the Constitution of the Union during her period in charge."
"It does not help that the Union's Constitution was rejected in the Netherlands and France last year."
"France will have a newly elected President next year and I hope that he or she will be able to make greater efforts than have been made heretofore."
"There are great challenges ahead for us but let us not beguile ourselves about that."
"Reforms must be made within the European Union and priority must be given to the work programme of the various Institutions for this reform."
"There is a danger that the Union will be ineffective if this is not done immediately. Thank you very much."
"(EL) Mr President, Mr Prime Minister of Ireland, if I were an artist and I was asked to draw the future of Europe, I would use black paint."
"We are following in exactly the footsteps which destroyed the Holy Alliance, in other words the previous unified Europe two centuries ago."
"We may have laws in Europe, but we have no national conscience."
"We may have capital but we do not have sufficient development."
"We may have industry, but we have no energy."
"We may have a great deal of land, but we have no borders."
"My question is: who here can tell me where the southeast borders of Europe are?"
"They are flexible."
"There are two problems: energy and the guardianship of America."
"It is a lie that America is leading us into permanent adversity with Russia, into reservations about China and into entanglement in Afghanistan and Iran?"
"Is it not America that distorts our vision of what is happening in the Middle East?"
"Is it not America that prevents us from developing an independent foreign policy?"
"That is the truth."
"Is there any reaction?"
"Is there any inclination for Europe to acquire autonomy?"
"We have a strong currency and we also have a central bank; but we do not have our own army."
"We can pass a constitution, but which army will defend the principles and values which that constitution will profess?"
"ΝΑΤΟ, with its American supreme commander, Turkish chief of staff and its Canadian chairman?"
"We need to decide."
"Do we want to take on the structure of a state or will we be - what we are - under the guardianship of the Americans?"
"Apparently we have no energy."
"There is a great deal of oil in the Aegean."
"Come and get it."
"The American and Turkish economies do not allow that."
"There is oil which can resolve all of Europe's problems."
"So let us make an effort to be independent, to be masters of our own house, so that we do not depend on the Americans."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to welcome the Irish Prime Minister."
"The Institutions - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - are in favour of a new model of Europe: we need to find out whether this new model is in line with what the voters want, voters who, at least in France and the Netherlands, have rejected the proposals made by the Convention."
"May we never forget to take account of the will of the people and not of certain ideals, which, noble and grand as they may be, are not shared by citizens and voters."
"This, in my opinion, is the fundamental issue for the foundations of a possible future treaty."
"Let us begin, for example, to dispel certain myths: some say that we need to change because we now have so many more Member States."
"The United States grew from 13 to 50 States, keeping the same Constitution more or less unchanged since 1776."
"If the bureaucrats need a new instrument, the same is not necessarily true for voters."
"Voters must be persuaded of the advantage of a new Europe: we need to make them understand, for instance, why being in the European Union is better than being in Switzerland or Norway, which do not belong to the Union."
"If we do not succeed in making them understand this concept, it will be difficult to achieve a consensus."
"I have one final observation to make: the Italian President, Giorgio Napolitano, has called for ratification of the treaty, but the treaty is already dead."
"This would only be a waste of time and energy now that, without the two ratifications by the Dutch and the French, it is pointless to continue with others, which, in any case, would have no practical effect."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to welcome the Taoiseach to Parliament."
"I would like to start on a note of harmony in saying that I have read with great interest his recent statements on the passerelle clause in matters relating to justice and home affairs and I entirely agree with him that we should not proceed down that road."
"Criminal justice policy, the fight against terrorism and action to defeat trafficking and illegal emigration, are matters that rightly belong to the nation state, yet we have not even explored all the options to improve intergovernmental cooperation in these and other justice fields, and I believe that we should."
"As for the Constitution, the debate now seems to be entering the realms of fantasy."
"The French and Dutch people delivered the fatal blow, and yet we hear this week that the Finnish Presidency has been quietly stock-taking with Member States to see whether it can somehow be resuscitated."
"Mr Sarkozy calls for a 'mini-Constitution'."
"The Commission rejects it."
"The German Government says it wants the Constitution kept intact and then resurrected."
"The outgoing Dutch Government made clear it would not have a second referendum."
"The British Government, true to form, appears to be split: the Foreign Secretary says it was a grandiose scheme which had failed; the junior Europe Minister says we need to address the substance of the Constitution."
"Well, has the penny dropped yet?"
"Europe needs to move on."
"It needs to move on to stop alienating the electorate in a dangerous way."
"I have called consistently for reforms."
"We must have economic reforms."
"We must address the failure to achieve the Kyoto emission targets."
"We must have those fundamental reforms, enabling us to compete with the emerging giants in Asia."
"We need to have agricultural policies that do not undermine the fight against global poverty and we need effective leadership."
"As my party leader has said, it is because we want to see a future for the EU and believe in a strong Europe that we call for a change of direction."
"Our continent is crying out for leadership and we debate a piece of paper."
"I have to say that history is sadly littered with unwanted and inappropriate pieces of paper."
"(PL) Mr President, six months have elapsed since the last debate on the future of Europe held by the European Parliament."
"Initially, the legal framework for the future of Europe was to have been provided by the Constitutional Treaty."
"This future is unfolding before our very eyes, since then it has been decided to proceed with the next phase of enlargement and welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Union."
"At the same time, however, there is a sense in which the future has been put on ice until the second half of 2008, which is when the reflection period for the Constitutional Treaty is due to end after being extended for a second time."
"In my view, we should use this second period of reflection primarily to consider the increased scepticism expressed by Europeans on further enlargements of the Union."
"The citizens of Europe need to appreciate and understand that decisions on the accession of new Member States are taken entirely responsibly."
"They also need to have the assurance that such decisions are made with full consideration for the Union's budgetary capacity, thus guaranteeing that it can function efficiently in the future."
"As earlier strategic decisions to ensure Europe's economic competitiveness with other parts of the world are implemented, it is important that we strengthen the role of education in the development of future generations of innovative Europeans."
"We should promote a creative economy based on knowledge and imagination, as this will be the key to success for European businesses at global level."
"A well-educated and dynamic European Union society is a sine qua non for the Union to play a leading role on the world stage, and to prove that as well as dealing with its own problems, it can also successfully combat international crime and terrorism."
"(GA) Mr President, firstly, I would like to welcome the Taoiseach."
"I am happy to say that, broadly speaking, I agree with your analysis."
"We do need to change the context, highlight the positives and retain the balance and essential substance of the Constitution."
"The impasse in the Constitution was precipitated by the 'no' vote in France and the Netherlands, but, in my opinion, this was not a 'no, no, no' to everything European."
"It was a wake-up call saying, 'The future of Europe concerns us as ordinary citizens and we too have a role to play'."
"Democracy, like life, can be a messy business and, while leaders must lead, they must also listen."
"We have had our period of reflection and we now need a period of consolidation, where the EU is seen to deliver for it citizens on the Lisbon Agenda, on protection of workers, on support for European business, on environmental sustainability and on the ability of the EU to compete as a player on the global stage."
"In essence, the EU must manage the challenge of globalisation for all its citizens."
"If the EU can deliver on this major task, then I believe it has a solid future."
"(GA) Mr President, I also welcome the Taoiseach to the European Parliament today."
"During this period of reflection, it is clear that certain people are contemplating one thing only, namely, how to get the best response."
"Be that as it may be, so much importance attaches to the debate about the future of Europe that it is necessary to include as many voices as possible from every sector of society and the range of the various opinions must be respected and attended to."
"We welcome and even encourage such debate."
"There is a vision of Europe which places people, equality, social and economic rights and civic rights at its centre."
"That is our vision in Sinn Féin and the vision of our partners in the GUE/NGL Group."
"Citizens are concerned, they are concerned about militarism and about making Europe into a fortress, they are concerned about political and economic power going further away from the ordinary person."
"They are also concerned about privatisation and that equality, sustainability and social cohesion will suffer as a consequence."
"We heard part of the response to that from the Taoiseach today, but the Council and the European Commission must state clearly whether or not they have heard those concerns and tell us how they are to proceed from here."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of today's debate is the future of Europe, in respect of which we fear the worst in view of Turkey's persistent refusal to abide by its obligations in international law resulting from its customs agreement with the EU, and hence to allow Cypriot ships in its ports, and particularly in view of the way in which Europe has reacted to this."
"Turkey still fails to respect basic human rights and flouts international commitments."
"It is a state that categorically refuses to reconcile itself with its neighbours Cyprus and Armenia and is already intimidating European Member States."
"Despite all this, official Europe insists that the negotiations be continued."
"Turkey aspires to be European, but takes its cue from the United Nations, the United States in other words, in order to escape its European obligations."
"In the current circumstances, then, its accession to the EU remains out of the question."
"If Turkey is laying down the law even now, what will happen if it is allowed to join us at the negotiating table?"
"If the EU wants to remain credible in the eyes of its citizens and to safeguard its future, then Europe must send out a strong signal and cease the accession negotiations with Ankara with immediate effect."
"(EL) Mr President, Prime Minister, I too shall take my turn in congratulating you on your presence here today."
"I think that all of us here in this Chamber agree that the European Union of the 25 today and of the 27 in a month's time cannot function with the same rules as the Europe of the 6, the 9, the 10 or the 15 Member States functioned."
"I recall that in May, during the previous debate again on the future of Europe, the Belgian Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the next German Presidency."
"Mrs Merkel expressed its intention to table proposals for the European Constitutional Treaty."
"We welcome her intentions, but I wonder if something of the sort is realistic or if this is an effort to resuscitate a text which is already dead."
"The answer cannot be unequivocal, because it obviously depends on the objective which is set."
"I sent letters to the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Blair, and to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, back in July 2005, in which I referred to the limitation of our demands to the regulation of institutional matters alone, such as the legal personality of the European Union, the new weighting of votes in the Council, the increase in the competences of the European Parliament, the creation of a position of Minister of Foreign Affairs and even the creation of a position of president of the Union, a reduction in the number of Commissioners, the abolition of the system of the three pillars and the strengthening of the institution of reinforced cooperation between the Member States."
"I believe this is the only way that Europe can get out of the crisis it is in today."
"(DE) Mr President, I congratulate the Prime Minister on his speech to this House, and am also grateful for his clear line on the constitutional treaty - no new negotiations, no cherry-picking, no residual stump of a treaty, no mini-treaty regulating just a few institutional matters - for such a thing, as has already been said here, really would rob the new treaty of its heart and soul."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, the popular participation aspects, the democratic aspects - all these things belong together."
"The whole thing was a package deal, an all-embracing compromise, and it must not be torn asunder."
"That is why our watchword must be that we will not yield on the substance that the new treaty can have, but we will be flexible about the form it can take."
"I fully agree with you that such a treaty must not be a book, but must instead be compact, precise and brief."
"All the things we might consider cutting out of the treaty are to be found in its third part."
"You also made reference to additional elements; it is by these that we may be enabled to address the concerns and fears of people in the Netherlands and in France, but we also need these two countries to give us a clear idea of what they want to see changed."
"There are Members in this House who seem to know what the people wanted;"
"I found their 'no' utterly vague, with no clear indication of where it was actually coming from."
"That is why we will have to wait for the French election and for the new Dutch Government if we want to know exactly what additional elements will be needed."
"I would like to see you deliver this speech not only in this House, but also in many of the capitals in the EU."
"It was under your presidency of the Council that agreement was achieved, and so you have a responsibility to seek out those who are friends of the Constitution and get this project completed after all."
"Mr President, the Taoiseach properly said that the achievement of the 2004 package was extremely tricky and complex."
"Surely it would be sensible, therefore, to ring-fence the preamble and the first and second parts from renegotiation and to focus all the effort on modernising and improving Part III?"
"Surely we cannot achieve greater competitiveness, a strengthened social partnership, improvements to a common energy policy and so forth without a substantive improvement to Part III?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, in the language of some of my ancestors, I should like to say to the Taoiseach:"
"(GA) Welcome to the European Parliament."
"Welcome to the Parliament of Europe, which symbolises the motto of the European Union, 'unity with diversity'."
"There are representatives of every political party in Europe, from Left to Right, from capital cities to regions, from governing parties to opposition parties."
"It is the Parliament that voted by 500 votes to 137 to endorse this constitutional treaty as the best way forward for the future of Europe."
"So I am particularly glad to hear you say today that we must find the solution to these issues, because the problems the constitutional treaty was intended to solve have not disappeared overnight."
"They have not gone away."
"We must find a solution acceptable to all 27 countries, including the two that voted 'no', but also taking account of the 18 that have voted 'yes', which will wish to keep the text as intact as possible."
"I was glad to hear that, though it has not yet ratified, Ireland also wishes to keep the text as intact as possible."
"That is an important message for us."
"In the UK too, my Government signed the constitutional treaty and was re-elected on the basis of a manifesto that said that it would campaign with enthusiasm for this constitutional treaty."
"There is wide recognition that whatever solution is found next June, and one must be found, it should take account of the will of the majority and keep as much as can be salvaged of this constitutional treaty."
"Prime Minister of Ireland."
"Mr President, in response to all of the speakers, there is obviously a great divergence of views and opinions, but this Parliament, by an enormous majority, did ratify and support the Constitution."
"However, I want to thank all the Members for their points of view."
"It is useful for me as a Member of the European Council, and having been so involved in the Constitution, just to hear those points."
"I think the exchange from that has been very valuable."
"It gives me a perspective that I suppose is difficult to get from this remove."
"As all of those Members have said, it is important we listen to the people."
"It is not always possible to listen to all the people, but in that case you can listen to their elected representatives."
"This has afforded me the opportunity of explaining the rationale underpinning so many views on the Constitution."
"I have also had an opportunity to give my views."
"I think that the Constitution is a very balanced and fair document."
"I think it is an equitable document."
"Of course it is made up of compromises."
"When you are trying to get 25 countries - as it was then - to agree, there have to be compromises in the text."
"It was not just a quick question of any one person saying 'this is the position'."
"Things change."
"As I went around Europe there were many issues that were totally different in different countries, that caught the public imagination, that created a lot of difficulties in the media, and then people had to change or deliberate on what wording they could agree on, so it is not perfect insofar as it is just written with no ambiguities whatever, but it has been negotiated."
"There are those who believe that perhaps it was written in isolation - I think there were some comments about that."
"I understand that after a few years, but I would remind Members of Parliament that the Convention had a very active group from Parliament."
"They worked very hard."
"They were the representatives of the people, they were elected by the people, they were answerable to the people and I think the governments are too."
"You cannot have a Constitution that is negotiated by 500 million people."
"You have to have their representatives doing it, and I think they did a good job on it."
"So sometimes that is the issue about legitimacy and democracy."
"I noted the points about fighting for the issues of human rights and values, and that this is what people are about, and not crime and drugs."
"The people I meet are far more concerned with both issues."
"They want to see that the rule of law, the rule of courts, the legal system protects everybody equally."
"However, they also want to see that those who are involved in criminality across borders and those who are engaged in criminal activity are dealt with."
"So if you are a supporter of human rights, then you are obviously a supporter of the Constitution, because the Charter for Fundamental Rights is the first time in Europe that we have put all these things into the Constitution so I think you should definitely be a strong advocate of the Constitution."
"I think what is necessary for us now is not to try to renegotiate everything."
"With the German Presidency coming up, the Chancellor has clearly stated that she will set up a small group of officials to deal with a small group of officials in every country to identify where there are differences or difficulties."
"In my view, that should count 90% of the Constitution out."
"The focus and the concentration and effort will then be on the remaining 10%."
"My colleague from Ireland, Mr De Rossa, made a very fair point, one I have made several times, and it happened in the case of Ireland and Nice."
"The issue then is to try to get protocols to deal with the issues, that is the sensible thing: not throwing away parts of the Constitution that have been agreed upon by Parliament, by the Council, by 18 countries across Europe, but to try to find and accommodate the difficulties and analyse what the difficulties are in those countries which have voted 'no', or perhaps others which have reservations."
"That is not an impossible task."
"It has been done already in the countries where the Constitution was lost."
"As stated earlier on, there were opinion polls looking into what those issues were and trying to deal with those issues."
"I think that is possible."
"If those issues are looked at in the IGC or the Council, it should be possible."
"I do not think it should take a long time."
"I would just ask Parliament, and hope - as I will try to do in Council - to keep supporting the Constitution with the balanced view that we have to deal with a small number of outstanding issues as regards some countries and perhaps as regards countries that have declared their positions recently because of changes in governments."
"We should try to deal with that."
"If we can do that, then with the reason and purpose and the whole desire to have a European Constitution - if that is what it is called; that is not something I get too excited about - we can move forward collectively to do that."
"I really believe it is possible."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Prime Minister, for your speech which I personally found very useful and pragmatic."
"The debate is closed."
"Verification of credentials: see Minutes"
"Membership of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes"
"Russia-EU summit (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Russia-European Union summit."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the eighteenth EU-Russia Summit was held last week in Helsinki."
"In accordance with established practice, the Summit dealt with the 'four common spaces' the two sides share, as well as international issues more widely."
"The Northern Dimension Summit between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland was held at the same time."
"Our wide-ranging discussion on matters crucial to relations between the EU and Russia was conducted in a constructive atmosphere."
"With regard to the new EU-Russia treaty, we saw that the process of establishing a negotiating mandate had been an intensive one over the previous few weeks."
"The EU will continue to deal with the issue of the mandate, with the aim of commencing talks as soon as possible."
"Four Permanent Partnership Council ministerial meetings have been held this autumn to enhance concrete cooperation."
"These have been between the EU and Russian Ministers for Transport, the Environment, Justice and Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs."
"With regard to the Common Economic Space, we found that there had been positive developments in many sectors of cooperation."
"Agreement was reached at the Summit on charges for Siberian overflights and putting an end to them."
"Furthermore, European Union and Russian Heads of State or Government recognised the enormous common interest that they had and the dependence on both sides in energy relations."
"The European Union highlighted the importance of the principles of transparency, predictability, reciprocity and openness in energy markets, investment and the transit infrastructure."
"These principles should also be incorporated in the new EU-Russia treaty."
"The Union insisted that the parties must guarantee their commitment to comply with the Energy Charter."
"Other themes of the discussion were the growth in trade and investment between the European Union and Russia, traffic congestion and the development of an electronic customs clearance system, on which we made very obvious headway."
"We said that progress in the talks on Russia's membership of the World Trade Organisation will have a very positive effect on the economic space shared by the EU and Russia."
"Negotiations on extensive and comprehensive free trade between the EU and Russia can be started when Russia has joined the WTO."
"The dialogue on the environment endorsed at the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council (Environment) in October will create a basis for wide-ranging cooperation."
"Cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs has made progress in many sectors."
"We considered it of major importance that the agreements on visa facilitation and the readmission of illegal immigrants signed in May should come into force as quickly as possible."
"On human rights, the European Union voiced its concern regarding the situation in Chechnya, and was of the opinion that it was important that all human rights crimes should be investigated thoroughly and individuals guilty of them brought to justice."
"The EU also mentioned the matter of preconditions for developments in the rule of law, for freedom of expression and for an independent media, including investigations into the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and the Mikhail Khodorkovski case."
"The EU referred to the human rights consultations organised at the start of November, which went more deeply into these issues and examined the human rights situation in Russia more exhaustively."
"The EU said that it was committed to closer cooperation on human rights and developing consultations on the subject."
"The European Union and Russia stressed the importance of direct contact between their citizens as a basis for a strategic partnership."
"This partnership can be enhanced in particular in the domains of education and culture."
"Cooperation between universities, as well as student exchange programmes between the Union and Russia, have been high up on the agenda this autumn, and we want to put effort into this in the future too."
"Our view was that cooperation in international matters is important for security and prosperity in Europe as a whole."
"We recognised how positively relations had developed in the context of several international matters."
"Cooperation between the Union and Russia must nevertheless be made to move in a more obvious direction."
"Some of the international issues raised were the Western Balkans, the Middle East peace process, the situation regarding North Korea, Georgia, Belarus and Moldova."
"A Northern Dimension Summit was held to run alongside the EU-Russia Summit."
"At this summit, new basic documents, the Political Declaration and the Framework Document, were approved."
"With these decisions in place, the Northern Dimension will be renewed from the start of next year."
"The renewed Northern Dimension represents the common policy of four equal partners: the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland."
"The Northern Dimension policy covers a vast geographical area, including the Baltic Sea, Northwest Russia, and the Arctic regions."
"It supports the implementation of the four common spaces between the EU and Russia in this geographical area."
"Moreover, the Northern Dimension focuses on special issues in northern regions, such as the vulnerable environment, indigenous peoples and health."
"A joint steering group of partners is to be set up for the Northern Dimension to speed up practical cooperation."
"The existing Northern Dimension partnerships - that is, the Environmental Partnership and the Partnership in Public Health and Well-being - we want to continue and develop further."
"We shall also aim to examine the potential for applying the partnership model in the transport and logistics sector and strengthen cooperation in the area of energy efficiency."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I am most grateful for the opportunity to inform you about the EU-Russia Summit, which took place in Helsinki."
"This was the third EU meeting with President Putin this year, following the one in Sochi in May and the dinner in Lahti, which gave us a good opportunity to speak about energy issues."
"Like my colleague, I greatly welcome the fact that Commission Vice-President Barrot and Minister Levitin were finally able to sign the Protocol on Siberian overflights."
"We have been working on this issue for many years and this is an important achievement, bringing an end to a persistent irritant in EU-Russia relations."
"It was also one of our conditions for Russia's WTO accession."
"Therefore I warmly welcome this achievement and thank Mr Barrot for his efforts."
"Immediately before the summit, we had a very good discussion on closer economic integration with EU and Russian business leaders."
"They delivered a message of strong support for the benefits this would bring to the business communities on both sides."
"Later, at the summit, there was a consensus that we should carry forward work on this subject over the coming months."
"Our vision is the creation of a common economic area, essentially operating the same rules and providing for fair trade."
"On energy, President Putin confirmed that the Energy Charter Treaty would not be ratified as it stands, but he also clearly expressed willingness to come to a deal that would respect the interests of both sides and include the principles of the Energy Treaty, as he said in Sochi."
"He called for reciprocity, including access for Russian capital to key strategic industries in the European Union."
"It is unfortunate that it was not possible to announce the opening of negotiations for our new strategic agreement."
"However, I am confident that the remaining difficulties will be resolved shortly."
"President Barroso made it clear, after the inspection carried out by officials of our Food and Veterinary Office, that we consider that the ban on certain Polish exports is not proportionate."
"He pressed President Putin strongly to lift it and, in any case, to agree to tripartite talks between Poland, Russia and the Commission to settle this issue."
"President Putin made it clear that the issue was not Polish meat as such, but the transit of meat from other countries through Poland to Russia."
"Finally, as far as the new agreement is concerned, it was reconfirmed, vitally, that there will be no legal vacuum when the current agreement reaches the end of its initial ten-year period."
"Even though we have not yet started negotiations for an agreement, we can continue and we have a legal basis."
"Another important issue already mentioned tonight is that of the long queues of vehicles waiting to enter Russia at EU borders."
"We agreed to give urgent attention to that."
"A mission involving the Commissioner for Taxation and some Member States had already taken place at the various borders between Russia and the Member States."
"We all noted that the origin of this problem was the growth in trade, namely the increase in trade between the EU and Russia, on the one hand, and the overall increase of trade with Russia, including transiting, on the other."
"But the infrastructure is already at maximum capacity and Russian procedures are cumbersome."
"For instance, there are currently seven security procedures, which Mr Putin has promised to reduce to two."
"That is very important."
"For its part, the Commission will shortly be making proposals in its report to address some of these customs issues."
"We also offered to cooperate on a pilot project."
"The question is whether data can be dealt with on the basis of a computer-based system."
"There was also a generally positive assessment of cooperation on Freedom, Security and Justice."
"The Russian side said that the agreements on visa facilitation and readmission would be sent for ratification soon. This is very positive, because readmission also helps the European Union."
"I would like to express my appreciation for the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee's input on Kaliningrad."
"On this matter, Russia raised the future of the Lithuanian scheme for cost-free visas, aluminium export duties and the treatment of minorities in Latvia and Estonia."
"We made it clear that these issues have either already been resolved or, in the case of visas for visitors from Kaliningrad to Lithuania, can be addressed."
"On external security, the European Union pressed for more cooperation in the common neighbourhood, while Russia emphasised non-proliferation and disarmament, particularly with regard to Iran and North Korea."
"President Barroso outlined progress towards meeting the Kananaskis commitments."
"It was agreed that new ways to cooperate on crisis management should be pursued."
"We also raised concerns regarding the human rights situation in Russia, notably the killing of Mrs Politkovskaya."
"President Barroso indicated that the perceived lack of due process caused concern in the European Union."
"As requested by the President of Parliament and other honourable Members, he also raised the case of Mikhail Khordorkovsky."
"President Putin defended the situation in Russia."
"I will not repeat the comments made by the Presidency on foreign policy issues other than to note the importance we attach to cooperation at the United Nations on Iran, to promote the six-party talks on North Korea and to work with Russia in the Middle East through the Quartet."
"Russia asked for an urgent meeting of the Quartet, which we hope will take place before Christmas."
"We also need to work intensively to reduce our differences on Georgia and Kosovo, on which an exchange of views was held."
"Finally, as my colleague said, the special Northern Dimension Summit took place for the first time."
"It was a success and I welcome Russia's involvement in that overall idea."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, a close partnership between Russia and the European Union is of vital interest to both sides, but for that partnership to be viable it must be based on balance: balance between the interests of the Union and the interests of Russia, and balance as regards economic issues and issues of democracy and fundamental human rights."
"Looking at recent summits, some progress was made."
"As was mentioned, rights in respect of Siberian overflights will meet WTO standards."
"That is a good thing."
"The visa facilitation of last year is also a good development."
"However, in general, the summit was disappointing."
"The Polish veto plays a major role."
"Although in general we are against vetoes and we must all work together to get this veto from the table, I must say that the European People's Party understands the Polish position."
"We agree with Commission President Barroso, who has called the ban on Polish meat by Russia an excessive reaction."
"He saw no reasons for maintaining this ban."
"That is why the European People's Party calls upon Russia to work constructively with us to get this veto from the table by finding ways to lift the ban on Polish meat."
"We would like to see the same attitude to Georgia."
"We hope that, as regards Moldova, the ban will go from the table - we saw an announcement about that today and we would ask Russia not to threaten to have bans on all of the European Union when Romania and Bulgaria enter."
"If we can proceed with the negotiations, let us talk about balance and economy."
"If Russia wants to invest in our industries, we must be able to invest in the same way in Russian industries."
"Let us talk about the energy chapter, where we hope, after the agreement in principle, that the basic principles of the chapter will be accepted."
"Last but not least, let us talk about human rights."
"I hope the human rights dialogue can take place in public."
"I really hope that Russia will send good signals after the recent suspicious assassinations by first of all catching the killers of Anna Politkovskaya."
"Let us, as Europe, be united on this more than ever before."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as the representatives both of the Council and of the Commission have indicated - without, however, spelling it out explicitly - there is no doubt that relations between the European Union and Russia have become problematic."
"My group was in favour of embarking on negotiations with Russia, on the grounds that this would have been the test of whether or not that country really was willing to engage in fair negotiations and arrive at fair outcomes, but we do very much understand what motivated Poland to exercise its veto, and, if discriminatory action is being taken - for that is how I understand what the Commissioner said - then Poland deserves our full solidarity."
"We cannot tolerate discriminatory or unfair treatment of any one or more Member States of the EU."
"Secondly, what is absolutely necessary now is that the European Union should act as one."
"It is not acceptable that individual countries should set off on solo jaunts and make it possible for Russia to cherrypick certain countries with which to carry on separate negotiations."
"I trust that solidarity within the European Union will remain unimpaired."
"Thirdly, our common neighbours need support, for they are in a difficult position where Russia is concerned."
"It is the idea of offering them support that underpins our ideas for an EU/Black Sea community, which we will be discussing in this House in December."
"Fourthly, there is the human rights issue, about which we will not be silent, whether or not we now start negotiations, but we cannot possibly accept it when President Putin says, on the one hand, that he has nothing to do with all the things that are going on, while, on the other, doing nothing to ensure that those who are responsible end up before a judge."
"It is the President of Russia who now needs to deal with this matter - him and nobody else."
"None of us - certainly none of the members of my own group - wants another Cold War with Russia, but we will not be silent for as long as such violations of human rights are going on as we see at present, resulting in the deaths of people who are contending for the free expression of opinion in Russia."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, a new atmosphere of cooperation has emerged between the European Union and Russia in recent months: the Spirit of Lahti, as it was called after the informal summit in the autumn."
"Furthermore, it was in this selfsame spirit that we were able to bring off the recent EU-Russia Summit."
"A feature of the Spirit of Lahti is the ability to deal with difficult matters openly."
"There were also frank discussions in Lahti and Helsinki on questions of human rights and democracy."
"At the summit meeting in Helsinki, agreement was hampered by a row which prevented the recommencement of talks on the new partnership agreement."
"The parties might nevertheless have realised that they could work together on the basis of the current agreement, which is still in force for the time being."
"Talks on the new partnership agreement must get under way as soon as possible."
"New ideas on how to improve cooperation, on the other hand, can be generated on the basis of the current agreement."
"There was a positive outcome at the Summit in two important areas."
"First, payments for Siberian overflights will gradually start to be reduced, and they will be phased out entirely by 2013."
"Next, agreements between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland on the Northern Dimension were signed while the Summit was being held."
"Thus, in the north we reached a new agreement which will provide a framework for cooperation in the four 'spaces' which the EU and Russia have agreed on establishing."
"Lorry queues on the border between the EU and Russia were discussed."
"Discussions on this have been taking place today at talks between the Finnish and Russian Prime Ministers in Moscow."
"The problem is that checks on the Russian side can be carried out by as many as seven officials."
"Now that number is being dropped to two, and border checks will be speeded up in other ways too."
"In any case, we need a quick solution to this urgent problem."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the relations and discussions between Europe and Russia are like surrealist art or a Woody Allen film."
"One of two things is true."
"Either Polish meat is bad, in which case Mr Putin is right and this meat must no longer be distributed in Europe."
"Or Polish meat is good, in which case it can be distributed in Europe and what Mr Putin and Russia are doing is unjust and sanctions must be taken against them."
"There is no question of exaggerating or not exaggerating: either it is true or it is not true, that is all."
"Secondly, with regard to human rights, Mr Putin, with his angelic face of a judoka trained by the KGB, repeats to us time and again: 'I have nothing to do with this business'."
"Assassinations take place all over Europe, a woman is assassinated in Moscow, an ex-KGB agent is assassinated in London and Mr Putin repeats: 'I have nothing to do with it'."
"Evidently, it was Mr Khodorkovsky who, from his prison, organised the assassination of Mrs Politkovskaya and it was Mr Lebedev who, from his prison, organised the assassination of the ex-KGB agent."
"Only one thing is certain: the laws passed in the Duma are laws that have been passed by Mr Putin's party, with the result that the opposition no longer has the right to speak, that non-governmental organisations no longer have the right to voice their opinions and that European foundations no longer have the right to exist."
"Again, on this subject, Mr Putin tells us: 'I have nothing to do with these events."
"We must not be taken for fools."
"I would prefer it if there were no prospect of cold war."
"No one wants cold war, but everything has its limits."
"We cannot accept that a public politician should lie to us continually: either Mr Putin chooses to be polite and to answer our questions, or we will take a different tone with Mr Putin."
"We may need his energy, but we do not need someone who constantly mocks us."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, it would be very bold to claim that the last summit in Finland was a success, although we made our own contribution to the summit."
"Our so-called solidarity was of absolutely no use."
"Whilst it is true that Russia needs the Union, it is also the case that the Union needs Russia."
"As long as we pursue an increasingly fierce Russophobic line, Russia will pragmatically continue to work together with the no-less-pragmatic EU Member States that are her biggest economic partners, that is to say, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, among others."
"This cooperation continues apace, to no one's great surprise."
"We will not integrate a Community perspective into the energy agreement with Russia if we simply favour European firms and help them to make profits from Russian energy supplies."
"We will not enjoy mutually advantageous and much-needed relations with Russia, if, for example, in official negotiations between EU and Russian parliamentary delegations, some of the seats reserved for the EU Parliament's representatives remain empty."
"It is hard to negotiate properly with one's eyes and ears closed."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, there is every indication that Russia does not wish to accept the implications of the 2004 enlargement."
"It is failing to proceed with the signature of border treaties with Latvia and Estonia, and has resorted to the use of gas to blackmail some Member States."
"Most recently, Russia has been conducting discriminatory trade policy against Poland, on the basis of forged veterinary certificates."
"Poland cannot tolerate such discrimination."
"More importantly, Poland cannot agree to opening talks under conditions dictated by Russia."
"I am grateful to the Commission for recognising these problems and seeking solutions to them."
"I would point out also that the tension surrounding the latest summit involves much more than relations between the Union and Russia, and how that is resolved will determine the standing and future of the whole Union."
"If Russia succeeds in dividing us, the chances of developing a political Europe and of institutional change will be much reduced, particularly as regards a common foreign policy."
"It does not make sense to create new institutions if they are not underpinned by common convictions, and if a common political will is lacking."
"Should Russia succeed in dividing us now, it will go one step further next year, and in the meantime our common foreign policy will be two steps behind."
"We should not therefore be surprised if NATO is assuming the political initiative, for instance regarding a common energy policy."
"NATO is already drawing up a detailed outline of its future role on this vital issue."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the latest EU-Russia Summit did not bring any specific results."
"Nonetheless, the way the meeting unfolded allows us to draw several conclusions which could be relevant to future negotiations on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"Firstly, it is standard practice for Russia to resort to tactics aimed at shattering the Union's unity, by presenting current disagreements as bilateral problems with particular Member States."
"This is what has happened with regard to the ban on imports of Polish foodstuffs."
"The same tactic had been applied previously to Latvia and other Baltic States."
"This approach has proved successful because certain groups within the Union joined in with the criticism of Poland, drawing on elements of the rhetoric used by Russia."
"Secondly, whilst the Union is very sensitive to the issue of respect for human rights in the Member States and throughout the world, such as in relation to the war on terror, it applies different standards to Russia in this regard."
"EU decision-makers deliberately avoid posing difficult questions, and if such questions do arise, for example, concerning politically inspired murders or the situation in Chechnya, they unreservedly accept President Putin's evasive responses."
"It is worth emphasising that good political and economic cooperation between Russia and the EU is highly desirable, but the unduly submissive attitude the EU has adopted in its dealings with Russia so far will not help attain that objective."
"Ratifying the Energy Charter Treaty and a more determined response to human rights violations should be deemed priorities in relations with Russia."
"Maintaining European Union solidarity in dealing with a difficult partner is just as necessary."
"Mr President, Russia, in its four common spaces engaging with the EU, remains our strategic partner."
"We need a strong, united and stable Russia as an ally against rising Islamist terrorism, working with us through the Quartet in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict, preventing in the UN Security Council Iranian and North Korean nuclear proliferation, as well as being a reliable trading partner in its supply of 30% of the EU's gas needs."
"Nevertheless, we take a dim view of the atrocities in Chechnya, the deterioration in human rights and democratic freedoms - in particular press freedom, and contract killings of journalists and opponents of the Government, such as my constituent from London, Alexander Litvinenko."
"We also reject the traditional Russian habit of cosying up bilaterally to big Member States such as Britain, France and Germany, in order to pressurise others such as the Baltic States and, most recently, Poland, by banning its beef exports."
"Russia all too frequently invokes phytosanitary regulations to bully troublesome 'near-abroad neighbours' such as Moldova and Georgia, where wine and mineral waters were banned."
"Otherwise, Russia uses differential gas pricing by Gazprom as a foreign policy instrument to put pressure on neighbours such as Ukraine."
"Recently, NATO released a report suggesting that Russia is planning a 'gas OPEC' with Algeria, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which would be a serious threat to the EU's external energy security interests."
"One way of responding to this, particularly after Russia's refusal to sign the Energy Charter Treaty, is to tell President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, on his visit to Brussels next week, that his country, like its ethnic cousin Azerbaijan, would be welcome in the European Neighbourhood Policy, rather than Kazakhstan joining Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in the Yalta Treaty's Single Economic Space."
"(FI) Mr President, Minister, I will only speak about energy, because one cannot speak about everything, and I want to raise half a dozen points or so."
"For us, it is vital to have security of energy supply, but what is important for Russia is that it has the security of a permanent customer."
"We need the market to be opened up on both sides."
"We also need long-term trade agreements."
"Russia needs them too, as it has to invest in its energy industry, which is almost in tatters."
"The energy debate needs more political guidance on our part."
"Energy is a very political issue."
"Despite that, we talk about all manner of things here, but we do not even go to Russia to familiarise ourselves with the energy situation."
"We need to go there."
"It has been a long time since anyone went there with this in mind."
"Finally, I want to say that energy is now a source of conflict for us with Russia."
"It cannot be taken care of with electricity or gas, but is a job for the politicians."
"So we have to act as politicians in the domain of energy, and together with Russia find a form of cooperation that is satisfactory to both sides."
"(Applause)"
". - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion of the new partnership agreement with Russia is a significant step in our cooperation, which will also help to resolve the energy issue."
"In the name of good relations, however, we should not disregard the package of demands which we need to put forward to Russia in order for this cooperation to be possible."
"We should not ignore the fact that in Russia democracy is being squeezed, and there are shocking restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
"Intimidation of political opponents and the murder of journalists are becoming more frequent."
"In the last seven years, 13 journalists have been killed, but not one contract killing of a journalist has been uncovered."
"At the same time, Russia's authorities are doing nothing to tackle racism and xenophobia."
"Quite the reverse: in Russia, violence has become part of the system of government."
"Russia is using the trade sphere as a foreign policy tool, by putting forward very high standards for its partners, which it, however, uses selectively."
"The European Union must ensure that Russia displays a genuine will to resolve these issues, and that it concludes border agreements without delay with Estonia and Latvia."
"This requirement must also be stated in documents, and I would like to thank the Commission for addressing these questions."
"(DE) Mr President, our relations with Russia are of strategic importance."
"Looking at the developments in the Middle East and considering the use made of Russia in the Security Council in matters relating to problem areas such as Iran and North Korea, we know that it is in our interests to have Russia on our side when dealing with these."
"We also know that mandate to negotiate a new partnership and cooperation agreement is to be extended to include the incorporation into that agreement of matters touching on energy security, democracy and human rights in Russia, and, if that is to be done, then negotiations are necessary, and a veto, by preventing the resolution of such issues, is not helpful."
"At the same time, though, it strikes me as of the utmost importance that the Commission and the Council, in the course of their negotiations, should bear it in mind - and you can use this as an argument, if you like - that any such agreement must, at the end of the day, be ratified by Parliament and that we will not accept an agreement that does not include certain conditions that are decisive in terms of solidarity between all Member States of the European Union."
"I would like to address one thing that makes it clear that it is self-evidently in our own strategic interest if the European Union acts as one in foreign policy matters, while also making clear that solidarity can be manifested also in smaller matters such as, for example, the issue of trade with Poland."
"If the impression is given that we are up in arms about the trade measures of a third country when they affect Germany, or the United Kingdom, or France, and make a great song and dance about it, smaller or newer Member States get the idea that their problems are not treated as being equally important, and we end up with a credibility problem."
"In view of the way in which this issue of trade between Russia and Poland has been handled so far, I can quite understand what the Poles are getting at."
"No actions are now being taken against a single country, quite simply because there is now only one trade policy."
"I therefore ask the Commission, and the member of it with responsibility for trade matters, to put this on the priority list in future, something that was not done for Poland, or, indeed, in the matter between Iran and Denmark three-quarters of a year ago."
"I think the Commission has to come to understand that this sends an important message to the people living in the Member States, that message being that we take their concerns seriously and care about them."
"That makes it easier to achieve agreement on other matters."
"(PL) Mr President, the Russian Federation applies double standards to Member States of the European Union, dividing them into good and bad states."
"The good ones are rewarded with normal relations, whereas the bad ones are penalised with sanctions such as trade restrictions."
"This is the age-old policy of divide and rule."
"We do not have any influence on the Kremlin's ambitions, because it is enjoying a renaissance of its imperialist outlook."
"Its leaders can afford to think this way as the prices of oil and gas are rising and we have to pay them."
"The way we react to this policy is crucial."
"If we do not all stand shoulder to shoulder in our response, we will simply be fuelling Russia's imperialist approach to international relations."
"I am not saying this to put the fear of Russia into us, but to ensure that improved relations between the European Union and Russia are based on a sound and stable footing, and all divisions between the good and the bad, the victors and the vanquished are done away with."
"(PL) Mr President, the outcome of the summit in Finland was not what it might have been."
"Our esteemed Russian partners would do well to learn the lesson of that experience."
"Russia and the European Union must recognise that this spells the end of a certain method of resolving issues between Moscow and the EU, and in particular between Moscow and some of the stronger and richer Member States."
"There can and must be an end to bilateral schemes between Russia and Germany, Russia and France or Russia and the United Kingdom and there must instead be honest debate with the European Union as a whole."
"The European Union also needs to learn from this experience."
"Any issues that might be an obstacle to inclusive agreements should be fully resolved in advance of such a summit."
"The Russian embargo on Polish meat was a case in point."
"The rest of the EU should not be surprised that Poland dug its heels in over this issue, which is of great importance to us."
"We saw it as a kind of litmus test not only of Russia's intentions towards Poland, but also of the intentions of the other Member States towards our country."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that we must never allow European solidarity to be an empty slogan."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for raising these human rights issues with our Russian partners."
"However, in the present situation, it is not enough to raise delicate issues."
"We are also entitled to receive meaningful answers, and then to see changes in the negative pattern that can currently be observed."
"Only such changes, by means of positive reforms, could stimulate the new trust we badly need to continue our strategic partnership."
"At this point, the Commission has to convince the Russian administration that democratic values do not have a second-rate status in our negotiating package."
"This is just what the democratically minded citizens of Russia expect from us, and we cannot betray them."
"Secondly, I encourage the Commission to be more active in standing up for EU solidarity - our basic principle."
"All too often, the EU regards Member States' relations with Russia as merely a bilateral issue."
"The EU's message to Russia at this point should be that if political or economic pressure is put on one Member State, then that will be a problem for the whole of Europe."
"This could convince our partners to change their behaviour."
"Finally, the EU does have leverage over Russia."
"Russia does not care any less about its relations with the EU than we care about them."
"Russia cares about its image as a global partner, so we should also make Mr Putin work to convince and prove that Russia could get rid of this negative pattern, or at least stop lying to us."
". - (LV) Thank you, Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mrs Lehtomäki."
"I think that the work which you have accomplished at the summit and what you discussed was all very good."
"Of course, we wanted talks to be begun on the new agreement."
"Why?"
"Because, of course, we want security of energy supplies."
"I do not think, however, in any case, that we should ignore any of our Member States."
"What we need here is solidarity."
"I would just like to point to a few examples from the past year which, in my view, show that Russia's attitude is selective."
"It began on 1 January by the cutting of gas supplies to Ukraine, and after that we learnt that wine from Moldova was no longer acceptable, but that wine from Transnistria, where the technologies are the same, was acceptable."
"Next, Georgia failed to obey - suddenly some scoundrel blew up the gas pipeline near Georgia's border, and Georgia had no gas supply for a week or two."
"Lithuania - the country is selling its shares in the Mazeiku oil refinery to the Poles, not the Russians. Suddenly an oil pipeline cracks, and oil no longer reaches the Mazeiku refinery."
"Just a short while ago, some of Latvia's canned fish was withdrawn from circulation in Russia."
"Our food health inspectorate checked tinned food originating from Russia in our country and in Germany, and found the same increase in these substances for which Russia had taken us to task."
"So I mention these examples of how Russia, unfortunately, always finds a reason to reproach others or suspend supplies or impose an embargo."
"Thus it seems to me that it is extremely important to include security of these energy supplies in the new agreement."
"I wish you success in your task."
"(HU) Mr President, trade is a very important element of the relations between Russia and the European Union."
"The basis for trade is legal security and predictability, and to this end, joint trade agreements must be respected."
"The EU must insist on full compliance with the principles and rules laid down in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"The Russian import ban on Polish meat products and other agricultural produce is an infringement of these principles and rules."
"These measures are excessive and unjustified."
"They should have been withdrawn long ago."
"The debate on trade remains unresolved because Russia does not show any willingness to cooperate."
"The EU must insist on the observance of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, and must stand in solidarity with our Polish friends, speaking with one voice in order to encourage the Russian party to honour the trade agreements."
"We must make it absolutely clear that the EU does not tolerate any of its trading partners using discriminatory measures against one of the Member States."
"A unified position is important as well because Russia is now threatening to impose an import ban on all meat products from the EU because of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"This matter also has particular significance from Hungary's point of view, since large quantities of wine are sold in Russia under the label of 'Tokaji' although they have nothing whatsoever to do with the Tokaj region."
"Russia is thus infringing on the various rules protecting origins laid down in the partnership agreement."
"It is because of this as well that the EU must take a unified stand on this issue."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union must show solidarity in its dealings with Russia."
"Moscow wishes to divide the countries of the Union into good and bad partners."
"The good ones are the largest and richest countries such as Germany and France."
"Those are the countries with which Mr Putin wishes to conduct his European policy."
"Bowing to such treatment will mean the end and the enslavement of the European Union."
"We must speak with one voice in our dealings with Russia."
"The European Commission should have intervened earlier over the issue of Polish food."
"Poland's concerns over the building of the northern gas pipeline should also have been taken more seriously."
"Russia is an important partner for the EU."
"We must insist on respect for freedom of expression and association within Russia, and also on respect for human rights and freedom of activity for the opposition."
"It is not true that all Poles are anti-Russian."
"We appreciate Russian culture."
"We believe Russia is a remarkable nation that has produced outstanding figures in culture, science and music."
"It paid a very high price for the madness of Bolshevik-Communist utopia."
"We shall always support those who like Hertzen, Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, Bukovski, Kovalev or Politkovskaya dared to speak openly about the need for a free and democratic Russia determined to devote all its energies to its own development and to improving the lot of its own citizens, whilst refraining from imperialist subjugation of its neighbours."
"President-on-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for this intense but worthwhile debate."
"A sign of good cooperation is that everything, even problematic issues, can be discussed."
"This prerequisite for good cooperation was met at the EU-Russia Summit."
"We were able to discuss even these difficult issues in concrete terms, and not just in terms of the principles involved."
"It is very obvious from this debate that we need a balance in cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"In the opening speeches of the Summit, both sides laid great emphasis on the fact that we, the European Union and Russia, exist in a state of great mutual dependence."
"We are dependent on them for many things, and they are dependent on us."
"Part of this balance is the notion that one approaches the partner on an equal footing and, furthermore, with respect."
"Moreover, the best results in cooperation with Russia are achieved specifically through dialogue and working closely together."
"That will not come about if we approach the partner in the belief that everything is right with us and everything with them is hopelessly wrong, and that we will teach them what they need to do."
"The best results are achieved through open dialogue on all issues, at the same time maintaining respect for the partner."
"The European Union's basic values are not up for negotiation in this dialogue."
"Our values are not for sale."
"The matter of human rights is central to the dialogue between the Union and Russia."
"Absolutely crucial to their practical implementation is progress in the area of the rule of law in Russia."
"The Union will be working closely with Russia in many ways to establish the principle of the rule of law."
"Our four 'spaces' for cooperation are a good opportunity for closer cooperation, not just in the energy sector, but in many other areas too."
"Now that we have to work to achieve a new mandate for a new partnership agreement, it is worth remembering that the existing agreement also allows us to cooperate more closely and effectively."
"So we do not have to just wait around for a new mandate: we can move on on the basis of the present one."
"The debate also made much of the importance of solidarity within the European Union."
"In this case solidarity is very evident in the fact that, right to the last, the Commission and the Presidency of the Council did their utmost to find a solution to the remaining areas of discord and to start talks on the new agreement."
"In that, unfortunately, we failed, however."
"President Putin said very clearly several times that Polish meat is welcome in Russia."
"From their point of view, the problem is that meat produced elsewhere with Polish labels on it is coming into the country, and that they cannot accept."
"Continued efforts need to be made to resolve this problem and reach agreement."
"Just prior to the Summit, the news broke that the United States of America and Russia had concluded a bilateral agreement on Russia's membership of the World Trade Organisation."
"As this major step on the road towards Russia's membership of the WTO has now been taken, it is clear that Russia will be joining the WTO in the near future."
"That will also bring with it new and really positive prospects for economic cooperation between the European Union and Russia."
"Commissioner Mandelson and Russian Trade Minister Gref also put forward their views at the Summit."
"We therefore have plenty of excellent opportunities, but also plenty of problem areas where cooperation has to be continued."
"Cooperation has to be on an equal basis, and one where there is mutual respect."
"Mr President, EU-Russia relations are indeed highly complex."
"On the one hand, Russia is a strategic partner, and on the other hand it is a common neighbour."
"We have to find a balance between these two very important elements."
"Second, with regard to the issue of meat, we have worked very hard with the Poles and with the Russians, but we as a Commission do not even have an official responsibility for that."
"We are responsible for imports, but we are not responsible for exports."
"Sometimes these things matter; for instance we have asked for trilateral committees."
"That is what we have offered."
"We have asked why we do not sit down together trilaterally and try to find a solution."
"At the end of a lengthy discussion, as regards illegally imported meat from third countries to Russia - it was not about Polish meat, I can only subscribe to that - Mr Putin agreed that he will now instruct his agriculture minister to work more intensively with the Poles."
"I hope that means the path towards finding a solution is clear."
"Unfortunately, I do not think we have more legal possibilities."
"Our colleague's comments on the WTO were very true."
"This will give us more legal possibilities."
"I am also happy to tell you that today we adopted the Neighbourhood Policy communication, which will be coming to Parliament in a few days' time."
"I will officially present it to the media on Monday, because today we had the discussion on Turkey."
"We are also talking about cooperation around the Black Sea."
"I wanted to mention that, because it came up in the debate."
"We think it is highly important to have the neighbours to the east together with the Black Sea cooperation - that means Turkey and Russia together."
"In the end, we have to re-engage and find solutions together."
"In this new agreement, there will also be the whole issue of energy."
"Many of those issues have already been addressed."
"The other day we had a very important energy conference in Brussels, and there is a whole set of different ideas on transparency, reciprocity and legal certainty for investments."
"That progress was made at Lahti, and that progress also has to be incorporated into our agreement, because we need a stable market of technology and a stable market that will help all of us using Russian revenues and resources, and help our own possibilities as consumers."
"Let me also say that we have shown the highest possible level of solidarity with Poland."
"I do not accept that this has not been done at the maximum possible level."
"On the other hand, we want to go on working, so I think we have to have this complex, balanced relationship."
"It was a very frank and open meeting."
"That is always good."
"I prefer a frank and open talk, and having a chance to solve one issue, maybe solving others the next time around."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the December part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(PL) I would like to express my grave concern about the ban on the import of plant and animal products from Poland that the Russian Federation has imposed over the last 12 months."
"I appeal to the European Commission to take more decisive action to resolve the problem."
"In view of the impasse in relations with Moscow it would seem that the best way forward is for this matter to be dealt by Russia and the European Union at the highest political level."
"Given the difficulties concerning trade in agricultural products with Russia, I believe it would be appropriate to empower the European Commission to determine trade policy as a whole, encompassing not just import-related, but also export-related issues."
"The whole of the EU may well experience difficulties trading with Russia, not just Poland, Romania and Bulgaria."
"The existing principles of separation of access to third country markets by individual Member States result in an uneven playing field for exports and discriminatory treatment of certain Member States."
"The division of competences regarding imports and exports appears to run counter to the principles of the single market and the provisions of Article 133 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, according to which the common commercial policy must be based on uniform principles, relating to export policy amongst other matters."
"In addition, current European Commission practices should be improved, so that it does not take unduly long to resolve any problems that may arise, and to allow a swift response to unexpected situations."
"(FR) Those who take the hardest line against Russia today are often those who, for a long time, denied the existence of the gulag, the totalitarian nature of communism and the threat of Soviet imperialism."
"For 74 years, the communists violated the most fundamental freedoms and solidarity, going as far as to force children to denounce their parents."
"It is not surprising that, coming out of this nightmare, Russian democracy is not yet perfect."
"Our democracies are no better."
"In France, for example, the Front National, representing over 15% of the electorate, has no representatives in the National Assembly, and the parties in power want to prevent its candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from standing in the Presidential election."
"Unlike Turkey, which the Europe of Brussels wants to welcome, Russia is a fully European nation."
"United by the same Helleno-Christian roots, our peoples are also sadly united by the same threats: falling birth rates and immigration, materialism and Islamism."
"The time has now come to reunite the Eastern and Western branches of our civilisation, beyond the dividing line of Theodosius, to reconcile the heirs of Saint Benedict with those of Saint Cyril."
"(PL) Russia is a very important neighbour of the European Union, and the European Union is an important partner for Russia."
"For this partnership to be sound and genuine, Russia needs to understand the nature of the EU, and the EU ought to help it to do so."
"The European Union is based on the principle of solidarity among its members."
"Consequently, this policy of sowing dissent between Member States of the Union and Russia's use of bilateral contacts to exert pressure on certain Member States is something we cannot tolerate."
"To put this another way, Polish meat is also European meat."
"The unjustified ban on the export of Polish meat to Russia is a problem for the EU as a whole, not a matter for bilateral relations between Poland and Russia."
"Upon investigation it emerged that the doctored meat certificates, which served as the pretext for placing the embargo on Polish meat, involved meat produced in the USA and exported to Russia via Lithuania."
"The embargo was therefore a political measure."
"I am glad the Finnish Presidency is choosing its words carefully and describing cooperation between Russia and the EU over energy in terms of positive interdependence."
"The question arises, however, as to what that really means and how the Russians would understand being positive and interdependent."
"In order to avoid disagreements over interpretation it would be best to include the main elements of the Charter and the Transit Protocol in the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between Russia and the EU."
"This would ensure liberalisation of gas supplies from Central Asia through Russian territory."
"Accession of Bulgaria - Accession of Romania (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, and"
"by Pierre Moscovici, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the accession of Romania to the European Union."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, Bulgaria applied to join the European Union 11 years ago, in 1995, and negotiations were opened five years later."
"Since those days we have seen remarkable changes: on the economic front GDP has doubled, foreign investment has increased from less than USD 100 million to over USD 1.7 billion, real wages have increased year on year and unemployment has halved."
"Since the opening of negotiations, we have seen three changes of government, representing a wide range of the political spectrum: from the UDF Government of Ivan Kostov, to the return of former King Simeon to lead his National Movement Government from 2001 to 2005, to the present socialist-led coalition under Sergei Stanishev."
"All have played a strong part in the reform process, taking forward Bulgaria's progress towards EU accession."
"This progress has taken place in spite of a very difficult regional situation, with conflict on Bulgaria's borders."
"The NATO-led operations against Serbia began in March 1999 with air strikes that destroyed the Danube bridges and severed navigation between the upper and lower Danube for two years."
"In addition to this economic disruption, devastating floods hit parts of Bulgaria in 2005, with many deaths and thousands left homeless."
"The fact that we saw NATO accession in March 2004 and have now reached the point of EU accession is a tribute to the determination and hard work of so many at all levels and from all shades of government, and no less a tribute to the Bulgarian people."
"They have seen their country turned over, examined and criticised at an accelerating pace."
"They have put up with dramatic change, as well as generalised and unjustified insults, but they have shown the forbearance and resolve to press on regardless, mindful perhaps of that old Bulgarian saying: 'a gentle word opens an iron gate'."
"I have always said that modernisation should be seen as beneficial in its own right and not merely as a prerequisite to EU accession, a sentiment that is reflected in my report today."
"At the same time, we all recognise that this process will continue for many years after accession."
"Many of you know that I am critical of so many aspects of the European Union, but I believe that the enlargement process is a great achievement, extending the area of democracy, stability, security and prosperity ever more widely, with generous financial support."
"Provided that funds are well targeted, properly managed and well used, this is ultimately to the benefit of all citizens, not least the people of Bulgaria."
"Let me focus on two particular issues."
"Police and judicial reform has been a major concern throughout the accession process."
"There has been much progress, but there is still a long way to go."
"Old habits die hard and there are so many competing demands for public expenditure."
"However, there is nothing more important for the day-to-day confidence of citizens in their government and administration than a professional, competent and fair justice system."
"I call for even more tangible and visible action by the Bulgarian authorities in dealing with serious crime."
"Let me also touch on the subject of Kozloduy, which has attracted much attention."
"Bulgaria is one of many countries in Europe facing an energy gap in the years ahead, with increasing reliance on energy imports from Russia and areas of instability."
"I am a great believer in safe, sustainable energy resources that minimise carbon emissions, as well as diversity and security of supply."
"The mood has changed and there is wide recognition that nuclear energy must play a stronger role."
"This is particularly true of Bulgaria, which has generated electricity from nuclear sources, both for its own requirements and for other countries in the region."
"The current undertaking is for the two reactors, Units 3 and 4, to be closed this year and subsequently decommissioned."
"We have reiterated the call for a little flexibility rather than unnecessary dogmatism."
"This will give time for more attention to be given to redressing the economic consequences of premature closure and for progress to be made in creating additional sources of energy supply."
"Let me briefly turn to another burning issue."
"We have still to secure the release of the Bulgarian nurses from Libyan custody."
"They have been wrongly incarcerated now for seven years."
"What a gesture it would be if they could be home for Christmas!"
"I hope that the message to the Libyan authorities will be even more powerful with Bulgaria's imminent accession to the EU."
"I should like to call on you, Mr President, the Council and the Commission to make a further appeal to President Gaddafi."
"Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to many charities that have worked hard in Bulgaria over the years, including Save the Children, ARK and Harvest for the Hungry, which is based in my own constituency in Chelmsford."
"I wish to thank the Bulgarian Observers for their cooperation and assistance."
"I look forward to working closely with Bulgarian MEPs next year, following elections in the spring, and I also want to thank Parliament for the privilege of being its rapporteur these past six years."
"In particular, I thank successive Bulgarian governments and the people of Bulgaria for their stoicism and friendship."
"We very much welcome them to the club."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 September of this year, the European Commission presented its report on Romania's progress towards accession."
"It is now for Parliament to give its opinion."
"This is an important moment, as we are coming to the end of a process that will see the conclusion of the latest wave of enlargement."
"It is not the beginning of the next wave but, in reality, the end of the fifth wave."
"It is a time of great historic significance since it signals the reunification of the European continent."
"I should like, in particular, to take this opportunity to thank the Commission and, firstly, Commissioner Rehn who, throughout this process, has done some very painstaking and very rigorous work and with whom we have enjoyed smooth and excellent cooperation during the last two years."
"Moreover, my report does not neglect to congratulate him."
"I would also thank most sincerely all those fellow Members who have significantly helped improve and supplement my previous reports."
"I would thank, in particular, my colleagues not only in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also in other bodies of this Parliament for their often pertinent comments and suggestions."
"This report is in the spirit of the previous reports since it is couched in terms that are meant to be positive, encouraging and open while remaining, I hope, tough, yet balanced."
"It also follows closely the conclusions of the Commission in its report of September 2006."
"As I see it, matters are clear. Romania was not ready in 2004."
"Since then, it has made considerable efforts, putting in place an impressive series of modernising reforms."
"It was important to emphasise this, and I wish to follow Mr Van Orden's lead by, in turn, warmly welcoming Romania, as he, for his part, welcomed Bulgaria."
"In essence, this is a short report that focuses on two points in particular: the accession date and the support and verification measures envisaged by the Commission."
"The report is structured around six main issues."
"First of all, the report pays tribute to the Romanian authorities for the considerable progress they have made since the beginning of the process."
"Everyone agrees that the efforts at reform engaged in by the Romanian Government and authorities have been extremely significant."
"It was therefore necessary to underline this in our resolution."
"In September of this year, the Commission went on to recommend that Romania join the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"My report supports this conclusion, for which I had, moreover, been hoping and praying for some time."
"The wording also emphasises that, in the areas identified as problematic by the Commission's May report, substantial progress has been made."
"It also notes that three areas were identified by the Commission in September as ones in which additional progress needed to be made."
"These were reform of the justice system, the fight against corruption and - to a lesser extent, I think - the absorption of Union aid in the agricultural sector and from the Structural Funds and the application of the acquis communautaire in certain areas of food safety."
"Fifthly, my report supports the Commission's proposal to introduce mechanisms to verify and support progress in these areas on the basis of a list of identified objectives."
"Such measures were applied during the previous enlargement, and this for the benefit of all the parties."
"It is not, therefore, a question of stigmatising or isolating Romania but, rather, of supporting it in its efforts to consolidate the reforms under way."
"Sixthly and lastly, my report urges the Romanian Government to take all the measures necessary and to make full use of the time remaining before accession so that recourse to the safeguard clauses might be avoided."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is the general structure of the report."
"Only five amendments have been tabled for plenary, reflecting, I believe, the broad consensus that has emerged in relation to this document - a consensus we sought within the various committees."
"I now turn to some of the positions adopted by my group."
"My group will not be advising Members to vote in favour of Amendments 1 and 2 by Mrs Gibault and Mr Cavada."
"These amendments do, however, reflect a statement signed by more than 400 Members, including myself."
"On a personal basis, I shall, therefore, vote in favour of them, but my group's position will be expressed through a free vote."
"My group will support Amendment 5 by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the efforts made by Romania towards accession and will vote against the same group's Amendment 4, which is already covered by the report."
"Where Amendment 3 is concerned, my group will abstain."
"Here, then, are the fruits of work that I have been doing for only two years - a period shorter than that of Mr Van Orden's involvement - and that had, moreover, been begun by others, notably by Mrs Nicholson, who preceded me as rapporteur."
"I am submitting the results of this work to you with some satisfaction because, in essence, I have always championed the same position over the last few years."
"We have a common destiny."
"Romania's and Bulgaria's place is in the European Union."
"We have to move forward. We needed, therefore, to be sympathetic, but firm."
"I believe that Parliament's position, which closely resembles that of the Commission, was the right one to adopt because it has allowed the necessary reforms to be carried out and because, at the same time, it enables our common objective to be realised, namely the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on the date specified."
"I think that we must welcome this event as one more staging post on the way to the reunification of Europe."
"I hope that the consensus for which we have all worked will be reflected in an unambiguous vote by Parliament."
"I should like the message received by Romania tomorrow to be a positive one, delivered loudly and clearly and, if possible, by a substantial number of people, whereupon Romania should receive a warm and sincere welcome."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 12 October the Council welcomed the Commission's monitoring report on the state of preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania for EU membership."
"According to the Commission, Bulgaria and Romania have shown through the progress they have made that they will be ready to accept the rights and obligations of membership on 1 January 2007."
"The Council examined the monitoring report thoroughly and reached the same conclusion as the Commission."
"We also acknowledged the reforms which both countries had carried out, and urged them to bring to a conclusion the remaining preparations for membership."
"The Council has expressed its support for the cooperation and verification mechanism relating to the reform of the judiciary and action to combat organised crime and corruption."
"This mechanism also makes it possible for safeguard measures to be adopted if necessary."
"The Council also supports the other measures mentioned by the Commission to ensure that EU policies are carried out properly and that the work of the institutions progresses flawlessly after Bulgaria and Romania have joined the Union."
"The Council stresses that both countries need to continue their political commitment in order to resolve outstanding issues."
"Bulgaria and Romania have to report back regularly on progress made in meeting the benchmarks."
"The first report should reach the Commission by the end of March next year."
"The Commission will then report back to the European Parliament and the Council on the progress made with regard to the benchmarks by June of next year."
"The Council will re-examine the situation in June 2007 when it has received the Commission's report."
"The European Parliament's views have been taken into account throughout the entire accession process for Bulgaria and Romania."
"Representing the Presidency as I do, I want to thank the members of the Delegation to the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee and those of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee, as well as all the Members of the European Parliament, for their important contribution to Bulgaria's and Romania's accession to the European Union."
"We will also obviously take due account of the reports being discussed here today."
"The Accession Treaty ratification process in the Member States has almost drawn to a close."
"We expect to be able to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members of the Union on 1 January 2007."
"Their accession to the European Union will conclude this historic fifth enlargement of the EU, which so far has proven to be such a success."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici, for their well-balanced, substantive reports, which, like the Commission reports, give credit to progress, but also highlight the areas where outstanding issues still exist for both countries."
"Both our institutions support the accession date of 1 January 2007."
"This is a historic achievement by Bulgaria and Romania, and I should like to congratulate them warmly."
"The key to their success was a combination of their own efforts with the strong encouragement and support of all institutions of the Union, not least of this House."
"Their accession will mark the completion of the fifth round of enlargement."
"I am happy to inform you that the ratification procedures in all 27 Parliaments have now been successfully finalised - I should add the European Parliament to that list."
"The Commission looks forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania as fully-fledged members of the European Union on 1 January."
"Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress after the publication of the September report."
"Bulgaria reported that border control and border management now benefit from increased cooperation between different offices, resulting in more arrests related to the smuggling of goods and human beings."
"Cooperation between the prosecutor's office and the police has improved, resulting in indictments and the dismantling of criminal groups."
"Romania has made further progress in modernising its detention facilities and has launched a new awareness-raising campaign against corruption."
"Official charges have been brought to parties involved in privatisations in the energy sector."
"So far, signs in other areas which were critical in September, such as aviation safety in Bulgaria and motor vehicle insurance systems in both countries, are rather positive."
"Final decisions on these issues will be made in December 2006 - very soon."
"In some other areas, specific measures have recently been taken to guarantee food safety on the internal market."
"Products from pigs and live pigs are not allowed to be exported from Bulgaria and Romania to the internal market, due to the existence of classical swine fever."
"The lists of agri-food establishments which are allowed to produce only for the national market, for a maximum of three years, have been updated."
"The Commission is setting up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"This mechanism will enable the Commission to keep a close eye on developments in these very important areas."
"The Commission has identified benchmarks for both countries, which they need to fulfil in these critical areas."
"Preparations for the Commission decision establishing the details of this mechanism are now advancing."
"It will be adopted before the end of 2006."
"It will allow the Commission to be thoroughly informed about the further reforms and actions in these important areas."
"There is one issue that I know to be of particular importance to the European Parliament: that of the application of safeguard measures."
"I can assure you that the Commission will apply the appropriate safeguard measures if one of the countries fails to fulfil the benchmarks adequately."
"The Commission can decide to apply the justice and home affairs safeguard measures at any time, if necessary."
"Bulgaria and Romania will certainly enrich the Union without compromising the proper functioning of our common policies and institutions."
"I should like to thank you for your support - in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Parliament as a whole - and for your constructive, substantive approach over the past years for this important step for our common European project, which will now continue with two important new Member States."
"(Applause)"
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (HU) Mr President, the Romanian Government deserves our congratulations for the efforts it has made in the process of integration in Romania."
"The population of Romania deserves to see its accession become a reality at last."
"In the opinion accepted unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I have been the draftsman, I have, in addition to the questions raised by the Commission, emphasised the rights of children and of national minorities, and most of these issues have made their way, in the form of a compromise solution, into our report as well, thanks to the good will of the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici."
"Why is this so important?"
"Because while it may appear that everything is fine, in reality the expectations of minority communities - such as autonomy - are treated as taboo subjects."
"Meanwhile, regions with Hungarian inhabitants do not have equal opportunity to access EU funds."
"Multiculturalism in higher education today means in reality, in the Romanian context, that at the trilingual university of Cluj/Kolozsvár, faculty members who put up a 'No Smoking' sign in Hungarian are dismissed from the university."
"It is my hope that 1 January will bring a change to the entire population of the country, including the Hungarian community, and that this inevitable change will bring about a change in mentality."
"I hope that the significant questions, including minority questions, will not become the tools of mere political show."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion on the accession of Romania on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to express our satisfaction, because Romania is developing - metamorphosing we might say - and progress is manifest everywhere, not only in the economic sector and job creation, but also in sectors which are crucial to democracy and the quality of life in the European Union."
"The authorities and society have understood the importance of education, transparency, justice, the protection of minorities and healthy conditions of development for children and progress has been made in this direction, as the report informs us."
"The Committee on Women's Rights expresses its satisfaction about the integration of a significant portion of the acquis communautaire concerning gender equality and encourages the government to continue in this direction and to cooperate both with the administration and civil society in applying this acquis."
"We also consider the creation of institutions such as the parliamentary committee on equality and the national equality body important and would highlight the need to secure funding and the staff needed in order for them to function."
"We were particularly concerned about the phenomenon of violence against women, both in the family environment and in the consequences it has on sexual exploitation."
"We even included statistics that illustrate that the phenomenon is worrying."
"Allow me to give a clarification here: our report, on the relevant paragraph of which you set an internal vote, concerns 800 000 women a year."
"I should like to clarify that these are data given to us by organisations in Romania for 2002 to 2003, for one year."
"It does not mean that there is this number of victims every year."
"In all events, the phenomenon is worrying and I believe that both the government and society will work in this direction."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (PL) Mr President, the fifth enlargement of the European Union will take place in January 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania join."
"We are all eagerly awaiting this event, and appreciate the tremendous effort made by these two countries in preparation for membership."
"Nonetheless, Bulgaria and Romania must continue with their reforms, particularly as regards combating corruption, organised crime, the drugs trade and people trafficking."
"It is also essential for these two countries to improve the transparency of the activities and procedures of their public administrations, and their capacity to absorb resources, so as to be able to properly manage structural and agricultural aid from the Union."
"There is concern about the poor living conditions still prevailing in children's homes and institutions for the disabled in both countries."
"The unfortunate lack of legal provisions protecting the rights of ethnic minorities and facilitating their integration through access to education and training in both countries has also been noted."
"It is important, however, to recognise the magnitude of the work already completed and its obvious effects, and to welcome almost 31 million new citizens of the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"We must ensure that from the beginning, these people feel that they are much-wanted members of our common European family."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, on 1 January Romania will join the European Union."
"This is a historic event for Romania and for the whole of the Union."
"It completes the fifth enlargement, which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always supported."
"This is a time for congratulations, a time to congratulate the Romanian people, their authorities and also the European Commission, which has played a crucial role in monitoring and stimulating the process."
"It has certainly not been an easy journey."
"There have been many reforms."
"When I began to follow the process on behalf of my group two and a half years ago, I remember that there were still doubts over whether Romania's accession could take place in 2007."
"The reports approved on a regular basis by this Parliament demonstrate the progress that Romania has made over recent years."
"Nevertheless, certain tasks still need to be completed in order for Romania to be able to profit fully from integration, as the Moscovici report that we will approve tomorrow points out."
"Today we have paid tribute to well-known protagonists of this reform: The Minister for Justice, Mrs Macovei, the Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Blaga, and Mrs Boagiu, Minister for European Affairs, as well as other noted political leaders."
"Mr President, I was in Romania just a few days ago."
"I know that the Romanian people are taking a very great interest in the accession that is so close."
"In Craiova, Ploiesti and Filiasi I witnessed for myself the interest that the Romanians have in accession and the impact that integration will have on their daily lives."
"I am sure that the impact will be beneficial, as it was for my country, Spain."
"Enlargement processes are also beneficial to the European Union, in terms of their political and economic consequences, because they promote and consolidate freedom and spread prosperity to our immediate neighbours through what has been called the transforming power of the Union."
"Furthermore, enlargements increase Europe's role in the world."
"As the report that we will approve tomorrow states, Romania's accession will enhance the Union's political and cultural dimension."
"It is the country of Brancusi, of Ionesco, of Tristan Tzara, of Enescu, of intellectuals and artists who were leaders of European vanguards."
"My country, Spain, has many ancient links with Romania; this is demonstrated by the large numbers of Romanians living and working in Spain."
"Consequently, also as a Spaniard, I welcome Romania's historic accession."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, this is a very important, historic debate in this House."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs for all the work they have done, and Commissioner Rehn for the clever and efficient way in which he has prepared the process that will now lead to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January 2007."
"This is also an opportunity to say a final word of welcome to both countries as members of the European Union."
"It has been a long and arduous process, but it is all very rewarding in the end, especially for the two countries, which were not able to join in 2004."
"They can now join the other central and eastern European Member States as full participants in the Union."
"We asked a lot of these countries, and we can see the results of their efforts, especially over the past year."
"I should like to congratulate both countries for this result."
"Throughout the process, our group has been very supportive of the accession of both countries on the earliest possible date."
"I would also like to welcome our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues, who have been Observers so far, but they will be full Members of this House as of 1 January."
"I am convinced that they will continue their constructive work after that date."
"I personally am also happy for another reason: I have been participating in so many debates on Romania and Bulgaria, and I am happy that this burden will now shift to other committees in this Parliament!"
"This is the final debate prepared by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on Romania and Bulgaria."
"That is also a good thing."
"Nevertheless, Parliament will remain involved on the basis of our reports, and on the basis of the progress report that the Commission will have to present in future on the homework still to be done by the two countries."
"I am quite convinced, however, that both governments and parliaments are well aware of what has to be done."
"Finally, as my last remark on Romania and Bulgaria, I should like to welcome all of you, and I am quite sure that both countries will play a constructive role in the future development of our European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - It gives me the greatest pleasure, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to welcome both countries into the European Union."
"Mr Lambsdorff has allowed me the opportunity of thanking Mr Van Orden for his dedicated and serious work, which has helped Bulgaria immensely to accede to the Union on this date."
"Bulgaria's accession process has not always been a smooth one."
"Mr Lambsdorff has empowered me to suggest that this is not entirely Bulgaria's fault."
"Perhaps the Council and the Commission might care to introduce some reforms for future accessions."
"He recommends that the reform of the justice system should be observed more vigorously from the beginning of the accession process."
"The same recommendation applies to the fight against corruption."
"These are the only mechanisms we can use to guarantee effectiveness and transparency in such difficult areas before future candidates join the Union."
"Of course, it is now important for Bulgaria to concentrate on the period after accession."
"Bulgaria must prove that she is able to implement the requirements the Commission has issued in its progress report in order to avoid any activation of safeguard clauses."
"It is clear, however, that Bulgaria is a pro-European country, as the recent elections proved, and it is now up to Bulgaria's decision-makers to continue their efforts and to follow their words with concrete and credible actions."
"I now turn to Romania, a country whose people have long been close to my mind and to my heart."
"What a pleasure it has been to be of small assistance to Romania in her move towards this wonderful accession moment."
"I congratulate most warmly my fellow rapporteur, and now the rapporteur, on his final report and on his previous work."
"It has also been a pleasure to work with him."
"This is a time of real celebration for all Romanians."
"Entry into the Union should trigger inward investment, which Romania badly needs."
"It will enhance workers' rights and, over time, bring prosperity within the grasp of all Romania's people: a true time of celebration."
"It is a pleasure to have in the visitors' gallery today Theodora Bertzi, the Minister for Adoptions, Alina Mandroiu, from the High-Level Group for Romanian Children, and Minister Bogdan Panait, who is in charge of child protection."
"I urge colleagues concerned about child protection and adoptions in Romania to go straight upstairs and speak to these experts."
"They have all the files, all the information, and you will be agreeably surprised."
"You will find that child health and welfare has progressed dramatically since the early 1990s."
"Indeed, as the Prime Minister said in his letter, Romania has vigorously addressed this issue."
"As the noted children's author J.K. Rowling said recently, 'When you look at how far Romania has come, it is hard not to concede that a minor miracle has been achieved'."
"Romania is a model for other countries hoping to reform."
"Romania was the state that acknowledged that there was a problem and set out to do something about it."
"Colleagues, vote for all of Mr Moscovici's report, but reject the amendments."
"In the Foreign Affairs Committee we rejected not only those amendments but the offending clauses in the opinions of the Women's Rights and Civil Liberties Committees as well."
"Romania has changed."
"These amendments reflect the old days and not the reality."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are not entirely happy with these reports."
"All I will say at the moment is that our group has tabled two amendments to the Van Orden report, one on compliance with the Copenhagen criteria in respect of the protection of minorities and another on the nuclear power station at Kosloduj."
"It is not a matter of doubt that what is called flexibility on the closure of the nuclear power station goes against Article 30 of the accession treaty; even Commissioner Piebalgs, who is responsible for energy matters, is against the provisions of the treaty being nullified in this way."
"It is at this point that the nuclear lobby creeps surreptitiously through the back door."
"Is the delay in the decommissioning of both blocks to be a test case for other agreements on nuclear plants' active life and the watering down of them?"
"Kosloduj is one of the most unsafe and most dangerous plants in Europe."
"The decommissioning of Blocks 3 and 4 by the end of this year was and is a condition for accession; the Bulgarian Government must, in this regard, adhere to the treaties and Europe must not give the impression that Parliament is expressing opposition to treaties currently in force."
"That would put Parliament in a difficult - indeed embarrassing - position vis-à-vis the Council and the Commission, and the impression that Member States would not be required, following their accession, to abide by agreements already made would be fatal to future accessions."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania's accession to the Union on 1 January 2007 represents a success for all of us and hope for the future of our common Europe founded on Christian values."
"These values will facilitate integration and allow us to rejoice in coming together again."
"In the same way as other former Communist countries were welcomed earlier, we will welcome these two countries among us despite the fact that their economies still lag behind the average for the rest of the Union."
"It should be remembered that as its name indicates, the European Union stands for something more than the former European Economic Community."
"The values at stake now are more than purely economic values."
"It is unfortunate, though, that these countries are not being accepted on the basis of equal rules for all."
"There is free movement of capital but no free movement of labour, and I fear the immediate aftermath of this imbalance after accession will be an unnecessary growth of Euroscepticism in those countries."
"On behalf of the Europe for the Nations Group, I warmly welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the Union."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, there is a certain inevitability about the debate today and the vote tomorrow; after all, the European Union wants to become a global power, so the argument goes that the bigger it is, the better, and that there is a nice, cosy consensus here in the Chamber."
"Well, not us!"
"In 2004, UKIP was the only British party to vote against the enlargement of the European Union, arguing that the free movement of goods and services is one thing, but to have the free movement of peoples between countries with vastly differing GDPs is nothing less than wholly irresponsible."
"We predicted a massive migration: condemned though we were at the time, we have been proved right; there are well over half a million in Britain that are registered for work, but nobody doubts that the true figure is much nearer one million."
"And there is one hell of a cost to it."
"Already, we have 55 000 people claiming some form of State benefit."
"Unemployment in the UK has increased by over a quarter of a million in the last year."
"We have a huge over-supply in our unskilled labour market."
"Even the OECD said yesterday that EU enlargement had been at a very high cost to Britain."
"And what is our solution to all of this?"
"To admit two countries that are even poorer than those that joined two years ago, with the inevitability, in percentage terms, of an even bigger migration!"
"I know everyone is in denial: we have had the Bulgarian Prime Minister here, the Romanian Prime Minister here; and they are all telling us that it will not happen, that there will not be a huge movement of peoples, but of course there will."
"There is a much better way of doing this."
"We should have a proper, on-demand work permit scheme, especially for skilled workers."
"We have got nothing against the peoples of eastern Europe wanting to get on, but we simply cannot have an open-door immigration policy."
"The truth is, we cannot take the numbers."
"It does not make sense, and if we carry on down this road, I am afraid there is going to be bad blood and bad feeling in many towns and cities across the UK."
"Then we have the extraordinary role that is being played here by the rapporteur for Bulgaria, one Geoffrey Van Orden."
"In Chelmsford he is a fierce Eurosceptic, our brave brigadier battling for Britain, the spirit of 1940, we can all sleep well in our beds!"
"But it is not quite the same here in Brussels, is it Geoffrey?"
"In Brussels, you are the Commission's man."
"You have done the Commission's bidding, you have done everything you can to get Bulgaria into the European Union, and it will lead to a mass migration."
"In fact, you resemble Alec Guinness in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, doing completely the wrong thing for what you think is the right reason."
"I just hope that everybody that voted Conservative in eastern England - especially those that are about to lose their jobs - knows what you and your party have done in this place."
"(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)"
"(DE) Mr President, it is a recurrent excitement to experience in person the different ways in which one can argue and thereby come to different conclusions."
"I, too, albeit for quite different reasons, count myself among the opponents of this enlargement, being firmly convinced that you, Commissioner, as well as the decision-makers who in fact set all this in motion many years ago without the necessary transparency and democratic legitimacy, are opting for the wrong strategy."
"The fact is that these over-hasty enlargement rounds will get us no nearer to a sustainable European Union or enable us to achieve the result about which we in this House talk ceaselessly and to which I - as a pro-European - continue to be committed."
"Although we are told that the country from which I come is to be among the principal beneficiaries of the enlargements currently in progress, it has to be borne in mind that, over the last ten years, it has been only the top per cent of earners who have actually seen their incomes increase in real terms, while the top ten per cent have more or less been able to keep up and the whole of the middle class have been put to flight."
"That has a great deal to do with the fact that - in parallel with the process to which Mr Farage referred - the other thing going on is outsourcing, which prevents the creation, in our various countries, of the social foundations on which a proper social model for a strong Europe might actually be built."
"I believe, Commissioner, that history will judge you - you and those with you who will make the wrong decision tomorrow."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would now, just a few weeks before Romania and Bulgaria join us, like to congratulate those two countries."
"They are welcome!"
"This has to do with overcoming the division of Europe; it is a victory of democracy and the rule of law over dictatorship, the victory of the democratic Europe over the past century's men of violence, over Hitler and Stalin, over Zhivkov and Ceausescu."
"While it is in that context that we have to see it, the job must nevertheless be done in a properly craftsmanlike manner if it is to work."
"That is why it is important to remember that there are such things as transitional rules on such things as, inter alia, the free movement of labour, involving the same process as was used in the other enlargement treaties."
"Transitional rules of this kind do not constitute discrimination against the countries in question; they are always to the benefit of both parties."
"That is the most normal thing in the world, and the safeguard clauses are an addition to them."
"I am very grateful to the Commissioner for informing this House that these safeguard clauses will actually be applied in the areas stated, just as they already, in fact, are being applied in certain areas, such as milk and meat, and, should it become necessary in such areas as law and internal affairs or in the use to which funds are put, the safeguard clauses can - as the Commissioner said, be applied immediately."
"We will take him at his word."
"This, again, does not indicate mistrust of the two countries in question; on the contrary, it is a perfectly normal way of going about things."
"It is for this reason that this House will implement the monitoring process that remains an option until three years after accession, and so I do not doubt that we will get it all together and form a strong European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that, following the accession of these two countries, the debate on the European Union's capacity for further enlargement will be of crucial importance."
"It is a debate that we need to take seriously if we are to be able to complete the political project of enabling the EU to take effective action."
"Mr President, today we are discussing the last reports by this House on Bulgaria and Romania."
"Just three months before the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, we are welcoming another two members into the family."
"We know that there are still some reforms to be completed, but I am convinced that both governments are determined to continue their efforts to satisfy the requirements described in these reports."
"I would like to praise Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden for their outstanding work and thank them for the excellent cooperation we have had in respect of both reports over the last two and a half years."
"I would like to add that I am very happy with the choice of Meglena Kuneva as Bulgarian Commissioner, and with her portfolio, which covers a very important policy area."
"Allow me to make a specific point on the minority law issue in Romania."
"It is very well known that this minority law today, almost two years on, is still pending between committees in the Romanian Parliament."
"I expect the Romanian Government to keep its promise and hope that the law will be adopted very soon."
"In conclusion, I should like to welcome the people of Bulgaria and Romania to a place in which they have always belonged."
"Their accession marks the end of the artificial absence of our family and opens new horizons for the future."
"(Applause)"
"author. - (FR) Mr President, I do not wish to adopt the view of those who are going to see the Romanian state from inside official cars with tinted windows."
"I am therefore going to read you a letter chosen at random from among those we have received from children in Romanian orphanages who have not been able to find Romanian adoptive parents and who will therefore remain in these orphanages because of a lack of resources."
"'Why', write Marianne, aged nine and a half, and Catalin, aged six and a half, 'do our father and mother not come to look for us?"
"We prefer to die than to go on waiting."
"What is more, we no longer want to eat, since there is no point.'"
"I have half a dozen letters like that, which I shall not force you to listen to."
"Why have I read this letter?"
"I have done so because there are two points of view."
"I am among those - and, in this, I support Mr Moscovici's report - who say that a large majority is crucial if Romania and Bulgaria are to join the EU."
"Their membership is something needed as part of Europe's destiny, and to argue otherwise makes no sense."
"That being the case, let us wind down the tinted windows of our cars."
"In view of the restrictions that crop up regularly in this report and that, moreover, the rapporteur himself has set out, together with compromise amendments, I would call for this report to be supported, including Article 16, which suggests that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs monitor developments in the situation concerning international adoption."
"I also call on my fellow Members to support Amendments 1 and 2, which remind Romania - and, to some extent, the EU too, Commissioner - of its obligations under the United Nations Charter and the Hague Convention."
"In spite of the restrictions to which I referred and which are there because of the vigilance we are exercising and the aid we are offering - in a family, one helps brothers and sisters in difficulty - I am delighted to see these countries finally come back within the EU fold after 70 years of isolation, 70 years in which we have looked on and been sympathetic but in which we have done nothing."
"It is the Romanian people who have today won their freedom and their right to join us."
"Mr President, first I should like to say that my group and I are in favour of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria."
"However, I should like to focus on the specific problem of the situation of minorities, especially the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria."
"At this moment there is a political party, OMO Ilinden Pirin, that has not been legalised by the Bulgarian state because several difficulties have hampered the process of legalisation."
"We think that the opportunity to be represented and to organise political parties and associations is one of the main aspects of fulfilling democracy."
"Respect for minorities is one of the main issues as regards fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria."
"We have to put it forward, and we have to pay attention to this, not because we are against Bulgaria, but that is our point of view all around Europe in all the Member States and all the states with accession to Europe and all around the countries, because the rights of minorities have to be upheld according to these criteria."
"(PL) Mr President, Bulgaria still has a great deal of difficult work to do."
"These areas include tackling corruption, organised crime and people trafficking, strengthening the role of the Ombudsman, improving conditions in children's homes and institutions for the disabled, recognising the rights of national minorities and creating a better climate for foreign investment."
"It is important to recognise, however, the enormous effort that has been put in to meet the European Union's requirements concerning the economy, legislation and social standards."
"None of these positive changes would ever have come about without the powerful incentive provided by the prospect of EU membership."
"This allowed the implementation of difficult and often unpopular reforms that were nonetheless in the interest of Bulgarian society and of the Europe as a whole."
"I am convinced that Bulgaria will not rest on its laurels after 1 January and that it will redouble its efforts to pursue its internal transformation, taking full advantage of the historic opportunity presented by its membership of the European Union."
"I would like to bid our Bulgarian brothers and sisters a warm welcome to the European Union."
"(HU) Mr President, I myself am a committed believer in and supporter of Romania's accession."
"Many people have different views, however, partly because Romanian undertakings were not always in harmony with their fulfilment."
"Allow me to give two examples."
"Despite its undertakings, Romania continues to have no minority law."
"It is also cause for concern that at the hearings of Leonard Orban, the future Commissioner-designate for Multiculturalism spoke specifically of Romania's multilingualism, while at the same time, two faculty members were dismissed from the University of Cluj/Kolozsvár, because they wished to honour the university's own commitments, that is, they put up Hungarian language signs in the buildings."
"I do not wish that those who do not trust that the undertakings will be fulfilled should turn out to be right."
"In addition to undertakings at the European level, we also need enforcement at the European level."
"In order to become an EU Member State in the full sense, Romania must show respect, respect for the rights of the 1.5 million Hungarian minority and for their cultural and administrative autonomy, since problems have to be resolved at their origins."
"Autonomy is needed in the life of the University of Cluj/Kolozsvár and in that of the Hungarian community as well, as the examples of South Tirol and Catalonia also demonstrate."
"Moreover, I believe that Romania will honour the trust placed in it by our vote, and that its accession will open a new chapter in the history of both the European Union and Romania."
"(EL) Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in welcoming the huge efforts made by Bulgaria and Romania to be ready to accede to the European Union on 1 January 2007."
"We welcome these two countries into the European Union."
"I wish, however, to highlight a particularly important institutional and political problem for the European Parliament: in paragraph 20 of the report on Bulgaria, the Council is called upon to view with flexibility and to make provision for a delay of about eight months to Bulgaria's obligation to close units 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station."
"I wish to remind the House that in Article 30 of the Accession Act, which was ratified by the Member States and their national parliaments, express reference is made to Bulgaria's obligation to close the units by 31.12.2006."
"I wish to welcome in particular the statement by the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which he truly undertakes to honour this obligation."
"The problem is in the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament is not respecting the democratic constitutional order of the Member States and decisions by the national parliaments."
"That is why I and my honourable friend Daniel Cohn-Bendit together tabled an amendment changing paragraph 20 of the report on Bulgaria."
"(DE) Mr President, I had the opportunity, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to lead a delegation to Romania, the object of which was to find out more about the use to which European funds are put."
"Like the rest of the delegation, I got the impression that Romania is trying very hard to use the money it gets from the EU to the benefit of all of us."
"Work is being done on dealing with corruption, they are cooperating in matters relating to the justice system and with OLAF too."
"It is particularly heartening to see how European funds are being used to really reduce the suffering of many children, and that is splendid evidence of how well European funds can be used."
"Problems arise only when - as sometimes happens - a country such as this one is deluged with too much money."
"That is, of course, a problem for the Commission, and this is where we need to remind ourselves that we should be willing - as Mr Brok mentioned earlier - to actually make use of the safeguard clauses that we introduced for the sake of a well-ordered accession process."
"I believe that Romania in particular, but Bulgaria as well, are - so far as we can judge - on the right track, and we should do our best to accompany them along it."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this multi-faceted debate on Bulgaria's and Romania's accession to the European Union."
"It has been a long and demanding process for these countries, but, as has been said in many speeches here, and Commissioner Rehn also recognised Parliament's contribution in this matter, it is very important and significant that the institutions of the European Union have given these countries massive support during the accession process."
"The reform process and the fulfilment of obligations resulting from EU membership are to continue in Romania and Bulgaria."
"It has become evident that, because this will be a long and demanding task, there is always the danger that the reform process will flag from time to time."
"That is why it is important that the support given by the institutions of the European Union, including Parliament, to these countries and the support for their programme of reforms continues."
"At the same time, we have to ensure that the Council is also committed to the notion that if there is a need to invoke the safeguard clauses, we will not hesitate to do so."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for adopting a selection procedure for Members of the Commission from the new Member States which makes it possible for them to be in their jobs from 1 January, as they ought to be under the Accession Treaty."
"The Council thinks that it is important that the Commission, as a college, is fully competent and functional from the first morning of enlargement."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Members for this very constructive and substantive debate."
"It is a very honourable way to welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union in the spirit of evolving European democracy."
"I want to use this last opportunity, at least this year, to discuss one or two issues, in particular concerning the Hungarian minority in Romania."
"We attach great importance to the protection of minorities, multiculturalism and multilingualism, which are core principles of the European Union."
"Over the years, the situation of the Hungarian minority in Romania has improved."
"There is always room for further improvement as regards the treatment of minorities and this applies to the current and future Member States."
"For instance, in Romania, we would welcome further progress concerning inter-ethnic relations within the police, among other things."
"Some speakers raised the issue of the future of our enlargement policy."
"We will debate this at the December part-session."
"I just wish to point out to you that in its report of 8 November 2006, the Commission called for a new consensus on the EU's enlargement policy that would combine both the historic mission of extending the area of peace, freedom and democracy on our continent and, at the same time, ensuring our capacity to gradually integrate new members."
"In my view, it is necessary that we start to intensify our work for institutional reform."
"That is necessary for the functioning capacity of the current European Union and, at the same time, it will also prepare the enlarged Union in time for further steps in enlargement."
"The Commission's view is that a new institutional settlement should be reached before the next candidate country joins the European Union."
"That means we trust that, as the European Council outlined in June, the four Presidencies over the next two years - the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies, and the French Presidency in the second half of 2008 - along with our Member States, with the support of Parliament and the Commission, will be able to achieve a new interinstitutional settlement."
"It is a simple fact of timing that the year 2008 comes before the end of the decade when the 28th Member State, which is likely to be Croatia, could be ready to join our Union, if it is able to reform its judiciary, economy and meet all the other conditions with full determination and concrete results."
"I very warmly welcome the debate that is to take place in December on our enlargement strategy and integration capacity."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(HU) If we had to sum up in one sentence the Phare report by the European Court of Auditors, it would go something like this: the 806 million euro allocated to Romania from the available funding was largely a waste of money."
"The results of the inspection by the Court of Auditors show that the projects were carried out, but the majority of them operate in a way that differs from the intended purposes, and in the majority of the projects audited, sustainability is simply not possible."
"The 'technical errors' and 'shortcomings' listed in the report are unfortunately the source of no small irritation on the part of European investors."
"The contracts are systematically misinterpreted by the Romanian parties, and therefore they make it impossible for EU investments to be completed on time and the expenses accounted for."
"Delays in implementing the projects give rise to overtime and overtime costs, which the Romanian party is not prepared to pay for."
"Meanwhile, the authorities are continually changing their decisions and the regulatory background, as well as the way these are interpreted."
"I wonder who bears responsibility for the Romanian state having spent the money, but not in the way and for the purposes for which it was received?"
"In recent days, Hungarian language signs put up on the walls of the trilingual Babes-Bolyai University were taken down by the administration, and roughly broken up in front of the students."
"I would like to know why, only days before Romania joins the European Union, one may not put up a 'No Smoking' sign in Hungarian?"
"It is my hope that one of the first acts of the Romanian Commissioner will be to call upon his country's authorities to restore linguistic freedom as soon as possible, as an indication to his commitment to the EU."
"(HU) Mr President, colleagues, Romania's accession to the European Union can be considered a historically significant step forward, which brings fundamental changes that will have a beneficial effect on the country's population as well as on the development of the European Union."
"In recent years Romania underwent very rapid development in both the economic and judicial spheres."
"I believe, however, that the struggle against corruption and organised crime still exhibits serious delays: therefore tangible results are needed in the matter of human trafficking and in particular the trafficking of women."
"The European Union today is not only an economic but also a social, political and cultural community, where the protection of fundamental human rights must receive explicit emphasis, as must the struggle against every form of intolerance, racism and discrimination."
"Romania should devote attention more decisively to protecting the Roma and the Hungarian communities."
"It is important to improve living conditions for the Roma minority, and to enable them to have access to jobs and appropriate resources."
"I believe that only a policy of zero tolerance can be followed with regard to racism against the Roma, while greater efforts are needed in the area of equal access to high quality education and health care."
"Protection of the Hungarian minority can be ensured only through measures harmonised with the principles of subsidiarity and self-government."
"It would be important for Hungarian students in higher education to receive full financial support."
"I welcome Romania's imminent accession to the European Union, and thereby the improvement of the situation of Hungarians living in that country."
"We cannot allow that in the course of accession, economic interests should win out over human rights."
"Economic and social consequences of restructuring in the automobile sector in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the economic and social consequences of restructuring in the automobile sector in Europe."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the restructuring plan announced in November by Volkswagen to the board of the company's Belgian division and to the press will have a major social and economic impact within and beyond the company."
"Allow me to express, first of all, my very great concern about the consequences that this plan is likely to have for several thousand workers and their families, as well as for the company's economic and social environment."
"Restructuring is sometimes necessary in order to ensure companies' competitiveness and survival and, in the last analysis, in order to preserve jobs."
"I am aware of the need for Volkswagen, in common with many other European companies in the sector, to engage in restructuring."
"It is important, however, to ensure that this process is well planned and well administered in order to minimise its economic and social costs."
"That is why, in March 2005, the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Restructuring and Employment', which set out the main features of a proactive strategy to which you have entirely subscribed, namely anticipation, partnership and the coordination of policies and instruments."
"As soon as Volkswagen's management announced the restructuring, the Commission made every effort to mobilise the instruments at its disposal."
"I met the members of the Belgian Government in order to convey to them our solidarity and to emphasise the importance of complying with the applicable rules under Community law, particularly the directives on informing and consulting the workers' representatives."
"My colleague, Mrs Hübner, and myself also made it known that the services of the Commission were available to make flexible use of the instruments of financial support, in particular the Structural Funds, in order to help workers affected by the restructuring."
"The European Social Fund has shown in the past to what degree prompt and targeted action may help reintegrate into the labour market workers laid off following company restructuring."
"The services of the Commission have been invited to participate in the crisis unit set up by the Belgian authorities."
"This will examine, among other aspects, the practical possibilities of using credits: either those remaining from the current programme expiring at the end of 2006 or those, constituting larger available funds, that will be available under the new programmes entering into force as from 2007."
"In any case, I can convey to you the Commission's desire to be proactive and as flexible as possible regarding the use made of the European budget."
"On 24 November, the Commission convened its 'restructuring' task force, founded in March 2005 when the 'Restructuring and Employment' communication was issued."
"The purpose of the meeting was to mobilise all the instruments at its disposal in order to reduce the impact of the restructuring measures taken in conjunction with the Belgian authorities and to make developments in the automobile sector part of a future strategy in Europe."
"The automobile sector is vital to Europe, accounting for 3% of European GDP and employing 12 million people."
"It makes a crucial contribution to research and development efforts and, each year, creates a trade surplus with the rest of the world of approximately EUR 25 billion."
"In common with all other sectors of the economy, the automobile sector has to confront some profound changes."
"It has nonetheless been able to adapt to the major developments with which it is faced."
"The figures I have mentioned bear this out."
"Irrespective of the specific case that concerns us today, restructuring in the automobile sector is, in general, part of a necessary effort at adaptation."
"However, the Commission neither wants, nor is able, to assume the company's own obligations and responsibilities in the process of restructuring that has been undertaken."
"I personally have written to the president of the Volkswagen group to inform him of our concerns and to ask him to do everything possible in order to minimise the economic and social costs of the restructuring that has been announced."
"I reminded him of the need to ensure that the Community directives on informing and consulting workers are complied with throughout the Member States."
"These Community documents specify the need to inform and consult appropriately placed workers' representatives in advance about any transfer of production and the redundancies involved."
"It is crucial to ensure the quality of any information provision or useful consultation at the appropriate level, whether it be about economic decisions or the consequences of these in terms of employment."
"I would also point out that, in 2003, in response to a Commission consultation on this subject, the European social partners jointly prepared guidelines for administering change and its social consequences."
"These guidelines state that a positive attitude to change and the existence of high-quality social dialogue in a climate of confidence are important factors for preventing or limiting the harmful social consequences of restructuring."
"The implementation of these guidelines is essential if we are to achieve Community objectives of anticipation and of support during periods of change."
"That is why, in March 2005, the Commission again contacted the European social partners and asked them to devise efficient methods of developing these guidelines everywhere in Europe and of ensuring their application."
"I intend shortly to meet the representatives of the social partners in order to consider with them the means of making faster and more effective progress along these lines."
"To return to the case that has given rise to this debate, it is now important to make room for negotiation within the group that is being restructured."
"There have recently been signs that the partners concerned - management and worker representatives - are committed to a serious debate on the industrial future of the various sites in Europe, as well as on the social measures to be put in place."
"While maintaining its offer of support, the Commission intends to respect the autonomy of the social dialogue beginning within the group."
"Within the limits of its competence, the Commission is taking initiatives and making available the resources available to it."
"In the current circumstances, I hope for nothing other than the firm commitment of all the parties to move in this same direction."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to extend a warm welcome to the workers of Volkswagen Vorst, the suppliers and their representatives, who are present here in the gallery, and I should also like to express our genuine solidarity with them in these difficult times."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the past few days, rather flippant statements have been made to the effect that, in cases like these, politics is powerless, but I see that as rather prejudging the situation."
"Politics can very much hold a grip on a number of important factors."
"First of all, the national government is very much able, by means of reliable and good governance, to create scope for keeping the burden on labour, the premiums in this case, to an absolute minimum and thus protecting our industry's competitiveness."
"Europe, too, should shoulder its share of responsibility."
"Thousands of workers are losing their jobs, and we should at the very least learn from this."
"This presents Europe, Commissioner, with a unique opportunity to show off its social side."
"The common European market, while economic in nature, also requires a social dimension."
"That much is clear."
"So we must now do what we can to reinforce this social dimension in the short term."
"First of all, by ensuring that the workers affected can rely on support from the new European Fund for globalisation without delay."
"We, the Christian Democrats in this House, are 100% behind this objective of the Fund, and we are counting, Commissioner, on the Commission's loyal support in this."
"What matters most is that every effort is made to ensure that the Fund can start on time."
"Secondly, we must also bring about real worker participation, which will in any case involve the evaluation of the 1994 European Directive in which this is enshrined."
"Commissioner, you have already made reference to the Commission communication of March last year."
"Well, let us seize the social tragedy at VW Vorst to make the necessary changes to the directive."
"I firmly believe in the future of the European automotive industry, but we must do everything we can - and this is how I would like to finish off - in order to produce energy-efficient and 100% environmentally friendly cars."
"I hope that the Audi A1 will be such a car and that it will be produced at the Vorst plant, thereby guaranteeing its future, despite the dark clouds that are gathering above it now."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I have three brief points."
"I am pleased to see that the Commission is looking to use the structural funds to help deal with the social implications of this dreadful development."
"However, questions have been raised over whether the Globalisation Adjustment Fund can be used or not."
"Well, I hope this week's news that Volkswagen is to build plants in both India and Russia will show that there are global considerations and that the fund will be used to intervene."
"Second, I welcome news that production of the Audi A1 might move to the Forest plant to save some jobs, but the workforce has already been warned that such a move must involve a drop in labour costs."
"I hope this does not turn out to be a cynical move by VW, taking away with one hand and giving back with another, but in the meantime dramatically driving down wages and terms and conditions."
"VW should be aware that we will be watching developments very closely in the months ahead."
"Finally, a question to the Commissioner."
"If the directive creating a general framework on information and consultation and the European works council directives are in force and are being observed in Belgium, how can this news have come as a shock last week?"
"Unless the Commission assiduously ensures the application and enforcement of social laws, social Europe will fall into total disrepute, and citizens will quite rightly turn their backs on the EU."
"I am glad to hear, Commissioner, that you are now taking action, but quite frankly it is a little late for the workers at Forest."
"Finally, I hope that the PPE-DE Group is solidly behind the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"That is not what I have been hearing."
"I hope we see full support in the vote two weeks from now."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, in the debate that we are having at present, it is important not to get everything mixed up and not to confuse all the various responsibilities."
"Acting, as we are, at European Union level, we must demonstrate the resources available to us at this level in order to contribute to the best possible solution to problems of this kind, whether in the metalworking industry or in other branches of activity."
"As you said, Commissioner, just now when you began to speak, there are two aspects."
"On the one hand, there are the companies and, if we want employment at EU level to be maintained over time, we need successful companies."
"On the other hand, there are the employees, who are in need of help."
"Through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and very soon, I hope, the European Monetary Fund (EMF), the European Union has the resources to help every worker individually with re-training, returning to work or starting his or her own business."
"This customised help provided by the European Union needs to be publicised by the media when you issue your communications so that our fellow Europeans might be fully aware of the action taken by the EU."
"What is more, it is crucial, as you have said, to be able to respond promptly."
"If a number of sectors of the automobile industry - at present, it is Volkswagen - need our funds, the important thing is to help the employees extremely swiftly so that the aid we offer is genuinely useful and enables them to find other jobs quickly."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the Volkswagen trade unionists in Parliament this afternoon told us that, although their first priority was to obtain an industrial plan from the motor manufacturer's management, they were also waiting for Europe to put an end to the social and fiscal competition between Member States that drags everyone down."
"Almost ten years ago, the workers of Renault Vilvorde were telling us the same thing."
"What has changed?"
"Mr Špidla, I find what you are saying quite inadequate."
"You talk about the autonomy of the social dialogue, but you are well aware that the employers are reluctant to engage in such a dialogue."
"We have instruments available to us."
"We need to strengthen the European Works Council Directive."
"Parliament asked you to do this as long ago as March 2006."
"It is also necessary to create a European legal framework that will enable European collective negotiations to take place at sectoral and group levels."
"The Commission needs to exercise more control over state aid and Community funds so that they are not used for the purposes of relocation within the European Union - an eventuality already referred to in the Cottigny and Hutchinson report."
"Finally, a number of taxation matters need to be harmonised - and I choose that word carefully - at European level."
"It is not enough to discuss a common tax base for European companies."
"What is needed is a minimum European rate for company taxation."
"Under these conditions, we might perhaps today - and, I hope, tomorrow - speak to the relevant workers in terms different from those we employed when we had to deal with the Renault case."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, to begin with, I should like to take this opportunity to greet a sizeable delegation in the visitors' gallery of workers from Volkswagen's Forest plant, officials from all the trade unions in the plant and representatives of subcontracting companies."
"(Applause)"
"A large contingent from my group visited the occupied plant yesterday and engaged in lengthy talks with the workforce and union representatives."
"What emerged from these talks?"
"The first and foremost requirement, Commissioner, is to save the jobs at that location."
"The European Union is in a quandary for want of an industrial policy."
"As Mr Jonckheer has reminded us, the crisis in the European car industry is nothing new."
"Vilvorde happened ten years ago, and since then other plants have been closed or threatened with closure."
"What has been done in the fields of research and investment policy and in the pursuit of balanced regional development?"
"What efforts have been made to ensure that workers are trained and jobs safeguarded, to develop the clean, reliable and affordable cars that are in demand today and to diversify the economic fabric and increase the number of secure, skilled and properly paid jobs?"
"The large manufacturing groups have been given their head in the name of sacrosanct free-market economics and unbridled competition."
"The immediate duty of everyone, including the European Union, is therefore to act to save these jobs at the Forest plant, not only for the workforce of the Volkswagen group but also for the 8 000 employees of subcontracting businesses."
"Mr Henin will pick up that point in a moment."
"Secondly, if this mass mobilisation should fail, raising the issue of compensation, the Volkswagen group must be formally bound to meet its responsibilities to the full."
"The trade-union leaders reminded us in detail of the long list of public aid in the form of diverse exemptions that have been granted in respect of this plant to a group which, incidentally, has seen its profits rise sharply over the past two years, at least sharply enough to enable it to announce yesterday that it planned to invest hundreds of millions in Asia."
"In addition, it goes without saying that the European Union should contribute to the compensation."
"At the heart of this affair, however, we see the need for structural changes in the economic strategy being pursued in the name of what the Commission calls a competitive Europe in a globalised economy, which, in plain words, means cutting wage costs, introducing flexible working conditions, creating 'shareholder value', in other words windfalls for shareholders, pitting workers against each other and using the threat of relocation to blackmail public authorities."
"This takes us to the very core of the celebrated liberal Europe, from which more and more Europeans feel totally alienated, and with good reason."
"Only a break with this line of approach can open the door to a socially responsible Europe and enable us to win back the trust of our fellow citizens."
"Mr Barroso often makes the case for a Europe that gets results."
"Europe in its present state delivers results such as this one at Volkswagen Forest."
"We could do with more Europe, a trade unionist told us, but it is a different Europe that we need."
"This demand will surely be expressed forcefully in the streets of Brussels on Saturday."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, with 4 000 workers laid off at Volkswagen in Vorst and at least another 2 000 jobs lost among the suppliers, these are truly dark times in my country for the affected workers and their families."
"The initial response of the Belgian Government under Prime Minister Verhofstadt has been to do what it always does, for, when there are economic successes, they are quite happy to consider them as yet another feather in their political cap, but when there are problems or setbacks, then someone else is always to blame."
"In a rather xenophobic reaction, Prime Minister Verhofstadt even blamed the Germans for pursuing a kind of 'own people first' policy, which is, in my politically correct country, about the worst accusation anyone can make - ignoring the fact that in Germany, 20 000 jobs are being lost and that we, with the social tragedy at Vorst, are actually experiencing the worst so far of an enormous crisis that is enveloping the European automobile industry."
"Let us be honest; nobody has a miracle cure for the tragedy that is unfolding in Europe at the moment."
"Before blaming others, though, our governments, and the Belgian Government in particular, should ask itself whether it has done everything in its power to rescue as many jobs as possible, today in Vorst, but previously at Renault in Vilvoorde, at DHL, Sabena and elsewhere."
"Nearly eight years after my country gained a government that promised it would make this problem a priority, Belgium is still facing a wage handicap of some 10% compared to its neighbouring countries. This wage imbalance is the result of the huge tax burden."
"This is not the only cause, but it is one of the reasons why the Belgian Government is to blame."
"I do mean the Belgian Government, for Flanders has for some time now shown the political will to use a cocktail of economic measures to make our country attractive again for investors and thus to create employment."
"We, too, are in favour of the efficient use of European funds in this area, but this is not a miracle cure, and the proposals that are being made for more European bureaucracy are, in my view, counterproductive."
"It is high time we all realised that our material wealth and our employment will not persist for ever of their own accord, that international competition will only intensify and that we, by being more flexible, reducing costs and creating an employer-friendly climate, really have to fight for each and every job."
"We must, above all, think about ways of improving the competitiveness of our businesses, also in respect of businesses from countries that enjoy hardly any, or no, social protection."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, relocations normally involve moving to countries where production costs are lower and employment laws are more flexible."
"In this case the opposite has happened: production is relocating to a country where production costs are higher and employment law is stricter."
"Everything suggests that this decision was not based on market rules, but most probably on power relations between the company and the trade unions."
"We seem to be facing a new kind of factor that may influence future relocations, which I would term the relocation of trade union power."
"This kind of relocation is always directed towards the centre, in the sense that it favours the strongest."
"If this practice spreads, we shall be moving in a direction that clearly runs counter to the essential values of the European project, because the rules of the market are flouted, productivity is not stimulated, and the fundamental principles of solidarity and of regional and social cohesion are violated."
"In view of such a practice, I fear for the future of the Volkswagen plant in Portugal."
"If something similar happens there, it will force us to think seriously about how to prevent a mere interest group from imposing itself on the normal operation of market rules."
"That is our responsibility."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think the political world can look on helplessly in the face of such tragedy."
"It goes without saying that the social effects must be cushioned, and if the globalisation fund is not intended for this purpose, then I have lost the plot."
"Needless to say, Commissioner Špidla, the social dialogue must work, but it has not."
"There is more to it for Socialists such as ourselves."
"When companies merge, the Commission checks whether competition is not distorted, but it does not examine whether restructuring operations are done on the basis of objective and economic criteria."
"It strikes me as more intelligent and more useful to have a Commissioner who guides restructuring operations in the right channels than to have one for multilingualism."
"I would ask the House to back this idea."
"I am delighted that the Belgian Government will be taking these ideas to the December Council."
"Multinationals cannot get off scot-free."
"They should be called to account."
"(FR) Mr President, every passing day sees the automotive industry shed hundreds of jobs."
"The multinationals are putting enormous pressure on their workers."
"They presume to use the workforce as scapegoats, challenging their acquired rights and almost implying that they are wallowing in affluence."
"The fact is that workers have never been more productive or less secure in their jobs at any time in the last fifty years."
"Not for thirty years has their purchasing power been so low."
"It is not the competitiveness of labour that is putting the car industry in trouble but movements of capital in search of maximum yields in the shortest possible time."
"Car-manufacturing groups engage in blackmail to milk the areas where their plants are located, and once they have sucked local budgets dry they start to look for pastures new where the grass is greener."
"It is high time this Parliament stopped confining itself to hollow rhetoric and took tough initiatives to defend Europe's industrial potential, to hit profiteers where their heart lies, namely in their wallets, and to guarantee employees the right to genuine job security and training."
"These are some of the aims underlying the charter that my group is advocating as the key to the defence and development of our automotive industry."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, what we are experiencing today in spectacular fashion, in this savage decision by Volkswagen with its tragic consequences, is ultimately no more than the submerged part of the iceberg that floats on the ocean of free enterprise and free competition, which have become the watchwords of this European Union."
"Every day, in fact, hundreds of jobs disappear in the wake of relocations and of numerous restructuring measures, although these jobs, of course, are axed more discreetly."
"And no parallel moves, or desperately few, are made to bolster the industrial and social policies that are trampled under foot on these occasions."
"This Parliament, Commissioner, has recently adopted resolutions on both relocations and corporate restructuring."
"When will the Commission and the Council have the decency at least to respond to these resolutions, to express at least a modicum of interest in them, which they have not yet done?"
"It is certainly important today to provide active, effective and pragmatic support to the victims of this new closure, but it is equally important to ensure that we move on tomorrow from words to action in this European Union, which will have to come to grips with this problem in a more resolute manner."
"The Union has fallen victim to a policy it wished on itself."
"(FR) Mr President, is it ludicrous to hold a debate without a resolution on Volkswagen today with one minute per speaker?"
"No, it is shameful."
"What sort of tragedy has to occur before the Commission proceeds with the revision of the Works Council Directive, which it is still blocking?"
"Did you pay heed to the Hutchinson report on relocations?"
"Will you allow Volkswagen to benefit from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund?"
"No, the reason why the Volkswagen plant is threatened with closure is not that liberalism has been malfunctioning; it is because there is still no social regulation of the market in Europe today."
"To the Right, which opposes any legislation in this domain, let me say that there will be a social Europe; it will be created in spite of everything; it will be forged in blood and tears, but it will be created."
"I call today not only for a Commissioner for corporate restructuring measures but also for a Volkswagen Directive, for the sake of the entire Forest workforce and for all those who, in my region and in yours, ladies and gentlemen, are losing faith in Europe and in politics."
"(FR) Mr President, the European social model, the Lisbon Strategy, a Social Europe: what meaning is left in these words, which are nothing but empty promises in the reddened eyes of Volkswagen employees and their families?"
"Precarious existences have become the norm, and pitting employees against each other has become a managerial strategy, like redundancies and unemployment."
"An ever-growing number of workers accept life on the brink of the abyss because they have no alternative."
"Europe was built on foundations of peace, but social strife is being fomented, with tragic consequences in terms of human distress, growing distrust of the European Union and an upsurge in support for extremist parties in every election."
"Are we to allow 4 000 jobs to be axed with impunity on the doorstep of our institutions, and more than 10 000 people to be put out of work, by a group that has simultaneously been announcing plans to set up a plant in India?"
"European funds will have to be mobilised, including the new Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"We shall see to that, perhaps by tabling a Volkswagen amendment - why not?"
"It is high time workers were respected in Europe, in the European Parliament and on our doorstep."
"Member of the Commission."
"(CS) Honourable Members, the case of the Volkswagen Forest is, of course, the kind of case that has accompanied market economics throughout its history."
"I feel that if we want to guarantee employment, the Lisbon Strategy is the right way forward, because its core objectives are knowledge-based competitiveness and the creation of high-quality jobs."
"I feel that this is the right strategy and we must implement it."
"The question of how to respond effectively to the Volkswagen situation is a different matter."
"It is clear that there are different responsibilities at company, local authority, national state and EU levels."
"All of these capacities should be mobilised responsibly."
"I am pleased that the EU institutions have responded rapidly, and, to my mind, effectively; they have provided their resources in such a way that their response has been both responsible and effective."
"It is also clear that social dialogue has a major role to play."
"I understand that social dialogue negotiations are ongoing, and that they have reached an important stage."
"If Europe is to sustain an effective social dimension it is, obviously, vital that the legislation in force in this area be adhered to."
"The Commission has therefore launched an inquiry into whether the directives concerned are being rigorously complied with."
"I believe that this will genuinely help to resolve this matter."
"Honourable Members, we have heard a broad range of ideas and suggestions developed from a number of different perspectives in this debate."
"It is clear that we have obligations arising from our responsibilities, from the Treaty and from effective European construction."
"I am sure that each case will open up a debate that may help to enhance the legal framework, and to change our processes and the way in which we respond, all of which is indicative of a functioning and thriving Europe."
"I should like, if I may, to return to the beginning."
"At this time we must mobilise the resources at our disposal, and at EU level, this is already under way."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(PT) The threat hanging over the 4 000 Volkswagen workers in Belgium shows that multinationals continue to act utterly irresponsibly, motivated solely by the desire to make ever-greater profits."
"They are completely indifferent to the social hardship and regional development problems they cause through regarding their workers as mere numbers and as cogs in a machine that are only of interest for the profits they can generate."
"This situation is an integral part of the process of international trade, liberalisation and labour market deregulation that the European Union supports and encourages."
"The situation is the same as that affecting thousands of workers in Portugal, particularly at Opel/GM in Azambuja, Johnson Controls, Lear and so many other companies."
"It is time to adopt measures to put an end to this situation once and for all and to guarantee firmer action to protect workers' rights."
"These measures must also ensure that European works councils are fully involved in decision-making processes, including the right to stop dismissals and relocations, and that there is effective control over Community funds allocated to such multinationals, thus forcing them to comply with all their workers' rights."
"Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights) C6-0206/2006."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, decision-making on the part of the Finnish Presidency with regard to the European Union's future financing instruments will soon be at an end."
"In an excellent show of solidarity, we have dealt with the matter successfully and adopted the majority of the Regulations on the new financing instruments."
"Although there have been a number of challenges, there has also been immense political will on the part of the European Parliament, the Member States and the Commission to reach agreement on the relevant issues."
"One challenge still lies ahead, and that is the adoption of the Regulation establishing a European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)."
"This is an important matter both for Parliament and the Member States, because it concerns the promotion of basic values as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union."
"Parliament and its Members have specialist knowledge of democracy and human rights issues, which has been a help in endeavours to attain a good outcome."
"The Regulation on a new human rights instrument to apply worldwide has been drafted to a very tight schedule."
"As well as Parliament, the Member States too have had numerous proposals for its content."
"It is a very positive sign that agreement has already been reached on almost all the issues in these negotiations."
"The Council, for its part, has unanimously approved the compromise text to serve as a mandate for the Presidency to conduct talks with Parliament with a view to finding a solution."
"It is the Presidency's aim to adopt the instrument at first reading."
"The reason for this will be clear to everyone."
"The current EIDHR expires in a few weeks' time, at the end of the year."
"We do not want any major disruption in the European Union's support for democracy and human rights."
"We are duty-bound to take a swift decision, not only because of the importance to us Europeans of human rights and democracy as values, but also because of the hopes and expectations made known to us by defenders of human rights and democracy in other countries."
"The instruments have been drafted in such a way that they form a whole that is as viable as possible."
"Democracy and human rights are also implemented by means of other instruments, and the EIDHR will act as an addition to this whole in special areas."
"It is for this reason too that the adoption of the instrument is very much in order before the new financing period starts."
"The Presidency of the Council strongly requests Parliament to reach a decision before the end of the year."
"The package adopted by the Council contains a very large number of amendments to the text of the Regulation tabled by Parliament with regard both to priority areas for support and to Parliament's own position regarding the implementation of the Regulation."
"A significant feature of the new Regulation is the recognition of the importance of work for democracy and, as part of that, the stronger emphasis on the work of parliaments and parliamentarians."
"The essential basis of our work in third countries is our reliance on international human rights conventions and the rights and obligations written into them."
"With the proposal for the Regulation, the conditions for players to be eligible for aid from the Union are being widened."
"It is good that we are able to acknowledge the diversity of human rights and democracy and to make flexible use of various resources in different situations."
"It would also seem that the instrument's financial resources will also be up slightly on the financing period now ending, so the inclusion of new players will not necessarily detract from the positions of the other players."
"The main idea behind establishing the instrument has been that it will make possible support for the work of civil society players in particular, and permit support in situations where that takes place without the specific consent of the government of the country concerned."
"It is important that this approach remains throughout, and that not too many forms of support for other players are added within the framework of the Regulation."
"The conditions for eligibility for aid in the Council's compromise proposal have been widened in accordance with the European Parliament's suggestions to include parliamentary and political foundations."
"Moreover, the draft Regulation will also allow for the eligibility of other players in special circumstances."
"In my view, that is a well considered, workable solution which takes account of the hopes and objections of various EU players."
"Parliament has been keen to highlight the special feature that aid which is granted within the framework of the instrument, mainly meant for civil society players as it is, can be given without the consent of the government of a third country."
"There has been general consensus on this principle between the Council and Parliament right from the start."
"I believe that we have also now succeeded in finding a way of citing this principle in a more precise and clear manner, given our obligations under the Treaty on European Union and international agreements and conventions."
"The Presidency is prepared to propose the inclusion of the principle in the first introductory wording, if there is agreement on the content of the Regulation as a whole at first reading."
"Parliament has also drawn attention to the importance of mentioning the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in a given country in the text of the Regulation."
"The text will be based on international human rights conventions."
"One might therefore consider incorporating this proposed area already."
"The Presidency is nevertheless prepared to consider this addition too, if the Regulation can be adopted in its entirety at first reading."
"The Council, for its own part, therefore, is ready to demonstrate even greater flexibility in order to find a solution before the year is out."
"Flexibility on the part of all sides is a requirement for this."
"In the European Parliament's committee report, it is proposed that political groups should be added to the list of those receiving support."
"This probably means, inter alia, political parties; that is to say, there would be financial support for the work of parties also operating in third countries."
"Democratic parties undeniably have an important role in the strengthening of democracy and human rights all over the world."
"It is very important that the criteria for support given within the framework of this human rights instrument are clear and that they are grounded in human rights principles agreed internationally."
"There will be nowhere near enough resources available under this instrument for general party support for all based on the same criteria, such as there is in many countries in Europe."
"Selecting individual parties as beneficiaries would be a very hard task from the point of view of establishing clear criteria."
"The choice would have to be made in such a way that no one would have the impression that party political views were taking the place of the democracy and human rights criteria when allocating aid."
"It is also clear that an increase in the number of beneficiaries in this area might mean less support for others."
"We have mainly tried to steer support in the direction of NGOs working on behalf of democracy and human rights in particular."
"The Presidency's compromise proposal takes account of Parliament's suggestions to add independent party foundations and national, regional and international parliaments to the group of beneficiaries."
"Article 9(2) of the Regulation also makes it possible to provide support in special cases to other groups not mentioned under this Article."
"The wording is very close to what Parliament wants to see, and it is flexible, because it allows problems to be solved during the financing period."
"For all these reasons, adding political groups to the text of the Regulation does not have the Council's approval."
"This issue may jeopardise the chances of having the entire Regulation adopted at first reading, and that again would give rise to a situation where there would not be any legal basis for EU action on democracy and human rights for the time being."
"Freezing all EU human rights and democracy aid to resolve this case would be a very harsh weapon."
"The Council has gone a long way in order to comply with Parliament's wishes."
"In order to achieve a solution, it is very important to incorporate and maintain the support of the Member States in this Regulation package."
"I hope that Parliament will show flexibility, so that together we can achieve our main goal."
"Our main goal is for the European Union to be able to continue next year to aid action on democracy and human rights by means of the new instrument."
"To ensure that this support can continue, it is vital to get a decision on the proposal for a regulation, and the sooner the better."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to keep it brief so as to allow this debate to come to an end."
"This financing instrument truly is a massive keystone in this comprehensive reform of the Community's system of overseas aid, and it gives me great satisfaction to see that you have succeeded in coming up, within a relatively short period, with a common draft regulation on human rights and democracy."
"I see this instrument as expressing, in an exemplary way, the European Union's unconditional commitment to democracy and human rights as fundamental factors in external relations."
"It is because we in the Commission regard your House as the most important of partners that we unreservedly stand by our statement on democratic scrutiny and coherence of external actions and will maintain regular dialogue with your House."
"In situations in which human rights and democracy are particularly at risk, and which call for rapid action on the part of the Community, I propose that talks should be called at short notice with a small group of MEPs representing the relevant committees of your House."
"Following the Council Presidency's explanation just now of how it has conducted lengthy negotiations in this field, I would like to say that we regard the compromise proposal it has put together in the course of these as overall doing justice to the expectations made of this new financing instrument, and I would also like to emphasise that it certainly reflects many proposals from your House that the Commission unreservedly endorses, dealing as it does not only with the process of democratic reform, but also with the overall protection of human rights, and putting a greater emphasis on support and protection for human rights advocates, without, however, neglecting the victims of torture and abuse."
"Moreover, it creates a specific basis for successful monitoring of elections - and for that I am very grateful - without making disproportionate demands on the funds available for this purpose."
"I can do no other than welcome this instrument and the greater flexibility, newly rapid orientation and speedy responses that it makes possible."
"We will, in this regard, give particular attention to making it possible for it to be drawn on not only by private individuals but also by incorporated and unincorporated associations, and will, in the cause of flexibility, use all means available on the basis of the Budget Regulation and the implementing regulations enacted by reference to it."
"I can agree to your House's proposals for a more detailed discussion in the recitals of the support's particular character as independent of the consent of state offices, and also for the inclusion of a reference indicating that the instrument is to be regarded as covering the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and persons forcibly removed from one part of a state to another."
"Unfortunately, though, I am unable, like the Council, to see any scope for the inclusion of political parties and political movements as the immediate beneficiaries of the financing granted."
"As I see it, the Council Presidency and Parliament - supported by us in the Commission - have, following quite lengthy debate, come to a very good compromise in agreeing that national parliaments should be permitted to be recipients of foreign aid."
"I regard that as objectively justified by the inclusion, among the objectives of the instrument, of the creation, promotion and reinforcement of participatory, representative and parliamentary democracy and the associated processes of democratisation."
"I could well imagine the funding of foundations being one way of overcoming our difficulties as well."
"So far, we have seen the most important thing as being that we, the Commission, should be able to be neutral and non-partisan where Community aid is concerned; that has put us at a great advantage, and one that we must maintain in future, for it is this that has secured the widespread acceptance and potential of our aid in third states, so that is something else from which we should not deviate."
"co-rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the month of September my co-rapporteur and I have been negotiating with the Council and the Commission with a view to gaining acceptance for Parliament's position on the European financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide."
"These negotiations have now been concluded, and, as has just been said, the Council adopted a common position last week based on a compromise text."
"This draft, much of which we had previously introduced in the form of amendments, satisfies most of Parliament's requirements."
"It stipulates that the use of the instrument does not depend on the consent of host governments."
"It permits the funding of non-registered organisations."
"It includes a flexible mechanism for the provision of direct support to human-rights activists who face imminent danger."
"This new mechanism should greatly enhance the effectiveness of our measures for the protection of those who campaign for fundamental freedoms."
"The compromise also contains an entire section devoted to the promotion of democratic principles, electoral processes and parliamentary democracy."
"Political foundations, as well as national parliaments - an element introduced by our Parliament - are explicitly enumerated among the bodies that are eligible for support."
"The section dealing with the protection of human rights also satisfies almost all of Parliament's wishes, the only exceptions being the desire for explicit reference to combating impunity and to conflict prevention."
"On the other hand, the rights of people with disabilities, corporate social responsibility, combating violence against women and many other objectives have been included."
"Parliament has also secured the establishment of an enhanced structured dialogue that will involve it in the formulation of strategic priorities."
"We should have wanted it to feature in the body of the text, but the compromise arrangement is that parliamentary involvement is to be ensured through an exchange of letters."
"As far as explicit reference to democratic political groups is concerned, the Council, as we have just heard, regards that as a no-go area."
"It therefore proved impossible to include a reference to support for these groups."
"Nevertheless, an element of flexibility was introduced to allow the funding of other players in duly substantiated cases."
"In this way, political groups, though not explicitly mentioned, will be able to receive support in certain circumstances."
"In conclusion, Mr President, let me emphasise the uniqueness of this instrument."
"It is the only one that funds the projects of non-governmental players without the need for prior authorisation from their government."
"It is also the only instrument that finances electoral observer missions."
"This is why it would be neither useful nor responsible to delay its adoption, and hence the funding of these projects, in the vain hope of introducing an explicit reference to political groups."
"Indeed, an obstinate attachment to that aim has already cost us dear at this stage, since it scuppered the deal struck with the Council on inclusion of the rights of immigrants and asylum-seekers."
"For these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support the compromise as negotiated with the Council."
"co-rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Flautre for her very hard work and that of her staff in recent months in trying to bring this instrument to the point where we can adopt it by the end of this year."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and its staff, and the Council, for their work."
"Both the Council and the Commission have worked very hard to try and achieve some sort of compromise on this instrument."
"I must say that, in general terms, the ambitions of the Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee, my co-rapporteur, have largely been met."
"I think on the question of human rights promotion, which represents universal values accepted worldwide, we now have an instrument which has the capacity and the flexibility to work effectively, primarily through civil society, and to achieve the goals of the European Union in its Treaty obligations towards human rights worldwide."
"There is, however, a deficiency."
"As colleagues know, I was the original promoter and founding rapporteur of the European initiative back in 1992."
"It was aimed at the transformation of the ex-Soviet bloc and it looked primarily at the democratic process."
"In the world today we now face different challenges."
"I have spent some time this year going to countries which are 'complex environments', to use the terminology of the United Nations: China, Cuba and Russia."
"These are the challenges of today."
"My question to Council and Commission - and since the Council has chosen to negotiate in public - is, why cannot we as a European Union avail ourselves of the same instruments that our Member State governments have given to the United Nations?"
"I regard this as a great puzzle."
"During my recent visit to New York I spent some talk talking to the UNDP, which, in its handbook on dealing with political parties, says, 'yet we have seen that the absence of strong, accountable and competent political parties that can represent positions and negotiate change, weakens the democratic process'."
"This is a parliament of political parties."
"Democracy cannot exist without competing political forces."
"So I just wonder whether the Council has lost its nerve."
"Faced with the challenges that we see to our east and to our south, is it really satisfactory that the European Union should not have the same capacity to involve itself in the political process, to reform countries where there is no democracy, that we have given to the United Nations?"
"I believe that the European Union should put its democracy money where its mouth is and include in the instrument a reference to supporting democratic political groups."
"That, in some countries, is the only way to effect change."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their cooperation, which meant that the document presented to the Committee on Foreign Affairs already encompassed the Committee on Development's requests."
"These requests are also found in the document drawn up by the Council, which I would like to thank for its work and for the flexibility demonstrated during the months of negotiation."
"In particular, I welcome the instrument's local dimension, so that it can respond to the specific needs of areas in difficulty; the feature of the instrument whereby action can also be taken independently of the consent of governments and public authorities; the transparency of the procedures and their consistency with other European external policies; its scope, in other words prioritising civil society; the access even for non-registered actors; the protection of women and children, migrants and minorities; the access to information; and the actions supporting democratic processes, even if the final draft of the document is not entirely satisfactory."
"I would like to comment briefly on the most controversial points: regarding the ceiling for electoral observation missions, I would have hoped for a stronger commitment from the Commission and the Council than an attached statement, but I hope that, after the comments made in this Chamber, this ceiling will be strictly respected."
"On structured dialogue, I note that the Council and the Commission have shown little willingness to improve the procedures in this respect."
"It is significant, however, that the Commission's letter is at least addressed not only to the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but also to the Chairman of the Committee on Development, in accordance with the legal basis for the instrument (Article 179(1) of the Treaty) and with the Rules of Procedure of Parliament (Annex VI)."
"In relation to political actors, I appreciate Mr McMillan-Scott's concerns and, although my committee has not given an explicit opinion on the subject, I have no problem in supporting his request, where openings exist."
"If this is not the case, I will consider with my colleagues, in the light of recent developments, whether it is appropriate to block the process after successful compromises have been reached, with great effort, on the key points, in order to succeed in concluding an agreement at first reading and to allow the instrument to be launched in January 2007."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to extend warm thanks to both rapporteurs, Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre, for the way in which they have adopted the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets."
"There are two things that the Committee on Budgets regards as important: accountability and the financial framework 2007-2013."
"EUR 1.103 million has been set aside for this instrument, and it is our committee's wish that this House should be able to monitor the way it is spent."
"Secondly, Parliament's rights in this area must be protected, both in terms of consultation with it, and the implementation of policy which must, in accordance with the Commission's statement, be subject to sound democratic control."
"We are therefore delighted that this proposal was adopted not only by the rapporteurs, but also by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"It is also very important to the Committee on Budgets that funds be made available from other significant instruments, for development, but also for partnerships with neighbouring countries and pre-accession."
"If this happens, if this instrument is used in this way, I am convinced that we, when we discuss this programme in the Committee on Budgetary Control in five years' time, will be granting discharge in this area."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (ES) Mr President, we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality welcome all of Parliament's efforts to ensure that this specific instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights could be debated today in this House."
"Within the important work of simplifying the instruments and procedures in the field of external action, we believe that it is very important that we have a tool with the main objective of supporting civil society, of supporting those who are working to achieve democracy and a better life for everybody."
"Within this context, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress the role of women as key players in the defence of fundamental freedoms."
"We in our committee have worked to ensure that this instrument supports objectives and measures to promote the rights of women and children, gender equality at international level and the fight against the discrimination suffered by billions of women on a daily basis."
"We would see the approval of this Regulation at first reading, so that it can enter into operation in 2007, as good news, particularly in view of the fact that 2007 has officially been designated European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is good that we should be given this instrument."
"It is only right and proper that we should defy the wills of autocrats and dictators and defend the cause of human rights and democracy, and hence also that of democratic political groupings in the countries concerned."
"Just imagine us, as democrats, living in Eastern Europe before the Wall came down, and our clandestinely organised groups being denied aid from the West on the basis of this very argument!"
"After all, all we are trying to do is to give the Commission the greatest possible flexibility in practice, and those officials who are wary of granting aid to political groups that are not specifically named should be encouraged to do so if the actual circumstances make it necessary."
"This is not primarily about party funding, so I would ask the Council not to restrict discussion to that."
"We cannot, though, be non-partisan in countries such as Belarus, for we would, in fact, by standing aloof from all political parties, end up giving support to Lukashenko and his like."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, for millions of people who put themselves at risk in order to defend freedoms and human rights, what we are debating today is absolutely vital."
"The European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights has above all been an achievement of this Parliament. It has not been an easy achievement."
"We have always argued that, if our foreign policy is genuinely going to incorporate the European Union's values, it must work expressly to promote the human rights that we all claim to defend."
"Now we have it; we have a valuable tool for defenders of human rights and all actors working to promote democracy, fundamental freedoms and justice to use."
"We now have our instrument."
"It contains a sufficiently full definition of the actors that can benefit from it, as Mrs Flautre has explained."
"So much so that there should be no justification for a battle that delays the implementation of this instrument, frustrating many expectations and hopes."
"We Socialists would also have preferred a clear inclusion of the concept of 'conflict prevention', because that is a prior condition for peace and democratic development."
"Nevertheless, for the sake of agreement and because it is necessary for the proposal to be approved, we accept the consensus reached with the Commission and the Council."
"My group will not therefore present any amendments."
"I hope that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shows the same degree of responsibility."
"We must not let the main protagonists in this instrument down."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, this instrument will be the means whereby the European Union will contribute to democracy and human rights worldwide."
"I find the compromise we have reached satisfactory on the whole, because it has taken essential points into account, and our rapporteurs, as well as the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission, deserve all credit for this."
"I am, for example, pleased that help can be given without the approval of third-country governments, and that parliamentary democracy is expressly mentioned, as, for that matter, are political pluralism and democratic political representation."
"Finally, I am pleased to see reference being made to independent political organisations."
"Without, of course, wishing to diminish the importance of human rights per se - quite the reverse, in fact - I would at the same time like to stress the crucial importance of political parties in every democratisation process."
"In a democracy, elections are indispensable, but not enough."
"If a democracy is to be sustainable, what is needed is effective, democratic political parties to ensure that a debate can be held not only among the parties, but also with the public."
"All too often, parties only function as a vehicle in order that a certain person, clan or group can be put into power, or indeed be kept there."
"This is, in fact, one of the main reasons why they are generally distrusted."
"NGOs and civil society are not sufficient, however, to guarantee a political debate and control over governance."
"This is why I should like to ask the Council and Commission to continue to make an effort so that support to democratic political groupings - in exceptional circumstances, of course - can be possible in future."
"Mr President, let me begin by saying that it was this Parliament that insisted there should be a separate legal instrument for human rights and democracy."
"It took a while to convince our friends and colleagues of that, but tonight's debate shows that it is a victory for Parliament, and the right decision was made."
"On the key issues within the debate, I very much welcome what our Finnish Presidency colleague has said about this being a programme that delivers help without the consent of host governments."
"To the Commissioner, I say I am very proud of the work that we do on electoral observation."
"I think it is one of the most effective things we are involved with."
"Our attempt to limit it is simply to say that it should not take money away from grassroots human rights projects."
"Both are important."
"My own amendments tabled included support for parliamentary democracy where it is being suppressed, making sure that spending under this instrument is additional and not at the expense of human rights work within the mainstream programmes, and to give specific reference in the scope to core labour standards and corporate social responsibility, to the human rights of people with disabilities, and to access to justice."
"I should like to thank the co-rapporteurs for their support for these amendments, and the Council and the Commission for the flexibility they have shown as regards Parliament's amendments as a whole."
"Tonight we have been debating the detail of legal texts."
"In this House we understand how important that is to ensure the European Union is effective."
"However, the main political message we should give is that just as this Parliament has established its own subcommittee on human rights, this Union is establishing an independent human rights and democracy instrument, because at the same time as the United Nations is elevating the status and role of human rights, so are we in the European Union, to help the victims of oppression, injustice and persecution, and those who defend them right around this world."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must make us proud to be part of the European Union when we see the action it has taken to promote democracy and human rights."
"These common values make the Union one of the foremost players on the world stage in this domain."
"In the context of this unending struggle, it was imperative to reform the old instrument in order to enhance its effectiveness."
"Thanks to the pugnacity of the rapporteurs, Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott, both of whom I congratulate, we have a draft here that truly moves things forward."
"It befits the importance of this instrument that it should be ambitious, and there is no shortage of ambition in its references to immigrants' rights and in the scope it offers to bypass the need for host-government approval of measures in support of democracy and human rights."
"I do regret, however, that the negotiations did not result in the extension of the instrument to cover conflict prevention."
"Moreover, in spite of greater parliamentary involvement in the monitoring process, the Council's refusal to formalise relations between our two institutions in this field is a deficiency."
"In conclusion, the effectiveness of this instrument will depend on its being regularly evaluated and on its revision, a process in which Parliament must play its full part, because I believe that Europe, armed with its values, is fighting here for a world free from fear."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the comments that have been made in this debate."
"It has become very clear that it is in our mutual interest to reach decisions on this instrument so that the European Union's aid for democracy and human rights development can continue and grow as from next year."
"Let me stress one last time that the compromise proposal in this discussion is an enabling one."
"It will enable aid to be granted even to the political groups which Parliament considers so very important."
"One last time, let me say seriously that I hope we reach a decision, and preferably quite soon."
"As has been mentioned in the debate, this instrument is very much the result of the European Parliament's massive influence."
"Its powerful role is in evidence in the text of this Regulation."
"Ultimately, however, we also need to be prepared to make compromises on matters where the Member States and Parliament share the decision process."
"Otherwise, no decisions will be reached."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude not only for the debate but also for the many sessions of negotiation in which we have eventually arrived at a good compromise."
"We have come a long way, and there was from the very outset a high degree of unanimity concerning both objectives and scope."
"The scope was then, at your House's suggestion, considerably extended, and even more detailed stipulations made, particularly as regards consultation with national parliaments and new measures for human rights advocates, but what are termed ad hoc measures are still possible."
"Turning to the political parties, I would like to say that it is quite explicitly envisaged in the scope of the regulation that support shall be given to political pluralism, to democratic political representation and to democratic reform processes at local, regional and national level, and, as has already been emphasised, explicit provision has also been made for the involvement of independent political foundations and parliamentary bodies as partners in the implementation of measures supporting the development of democracy."
"It follows that it will be possible to implement the instrument for promoting democracy in a primarily political way, which, I think, is what we all want it to do."
"That being so, let me say that this draft of a new regulation, which has been the subject of really intensive negotiations, deserves - or so I believe - your House's support."
"By way of conclusion, let me once more point out that this is the last of the financial instruments with which we will have to deal today, and, as I think we have all managed to come up with good and sustainable solutions to the others, we should take care to ensure that the democracy and human rights instrument can be put into effect beginning on the due date of 1 January 2007, for we have tried to be as flexible as circumstances require."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be in December."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(ET) The development of civil society and democratic mechanisms throughout the world, and especially in the vicinity of the European Union, is of vital importance to the stability of Europe itself."
"We must help to solve problems on the spot, instead of being overcome by the flood of political and economic refugees."
"The opponents of civil society have taken advantage of the inflexibility of our bureaucracy, and have criticised the adherence to programme documents as if they were scripture."
"Recently, the Russian authorities have robbed several international organisations of their legal basis."
"In accordance with the present rules, we can no longer fund these organisations."
"We face the same problem in separatist Trans-Dnistria, which is governed by a puppet regime which is a keen student of the Kremlin's methods."
"The report draws the only possible conclusion - we must become more flexible."
"We must be able to react quickly and appropriately and finance unforeseen measures and organisations which lack the approval of governments, if necessary even covering our tracks."
"Such flexibility also presupposes good monitoring."
"It is for that reason that I strongly support Parliament's greater involvement in monitoring."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"- (SL) Allow me, first of all, to extend a warm welcome to Romania and Bulgaria on their entry to the European Union."
"I would, however, like to mention one of the conditions for the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, namely the closure of the Kozloduj nuclear power plant."
"Despite the modernised safety system and the positive safety assessment by the relevant European institutions, Bulgaria must close reactors 3 and 4 by the end of 2006."
"Bulgaria exports electricity to all its neighbouring countries, and numerous Members of this House have repeatedly drawn attention to the enormous social, economic and environmental damage that would be caused, and to the problems that would ensue, in the form of an increased dependence on imports and of problems in obtaining a reliable energy supply, should both reactors be closed."
"Given the nature of the problem, I hope that the Council will react flexibly and make arrangements with the Bulgarian Government to defer the closure of both reactors."
"At a time when we have been placing so much emphasis on the importance of competitiveness, safety and a sustainable energy supply, calls for the closure of Kozloduj are downright ridiculous."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some members of the World Trade Organization do not comply with fundamental social standards and use the violation of social rights to compete unfairly and to distort the rules of competition."
"Besides the European Communication on promoting decent work for all, how is the Union using its influence in the WTO to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of workers in member countries?"
"There are 200 million children in paid employment in the world, 12 million people perform forced labour, more than two million employees die every year from the consequences of accidents at work or of occupational diseases, and 145 trade unionists were assassinated last year."
"In the light of these facts, it is not surprising that globalisation frightens our fellow citizens."
"Declaring good intentions is laudable, but it is not enough."
"The time has come to penalise all countries that benefit from the opening of markets but refuse to comply with the International Labour Conventions."
"Europe must organise itself and use its collective influence in the WTO to ensure that the requirements of the International Labour Organization are respected."
"(LT) The European Parliament often discusses issues that are topical to all countries as well as issues that are only of interest to representatives of certain countries."
"However, the European Parliament Press Service does not reflect this distinction, and the national press services attached to the European Parliament (like Lithuania's for example) state that they cannot designate issues in their summaries as priority issues if they have not been designated as such for the European Parliament Press Service."
"Therefore, matters of importance to Lithuania, such as the Baltic Sea Strategy or relations with Russia, are not reflected in the Lithuanian press reports."
"They are relegated to secondary importance."
"I strongly request that the European Parliament Bureau looks into the activities of the European Parliament Press Service to ensure that attention is given not only to issues of general European interest, but also to issues of interest to individual countries, whose concerns are also discussed in Parliament."
"(NL) Mr President, tomorrow, this House will be voting on a proposal to liberalise the European fireworks market, something desired by nobody in Europe except the fireworks industry, which obviously has a hand in both the Commission document and the report."
"There are major discrepancies in fireworks legislation in European countries."
"In my own country, the Netherlands, we have exercised extreme caution ever since a terrible disaster in a fireworks factory in Enschede."
"We are not waiting for Europe to hand down to us a harmonisation proposal preventing us from imposing our own stricter fireworks requirements."
"Since I take the view that public safety should always prevail over the profits made by the fireworks industry, I shall be advising everyone to vote against this report tomorrow."
"(PL) Mr President, the draft report on alleged CIA detention centres on European territory was presented yesterday by Mr Fava."
"In this report Poland is singled out as the only European Union Member State where such secret CIA detention centres could have been located."
"No evidence is provided in support of this statement."
"It is mere supposition."
"This attempt to compromise a new Member State by accusing it of cooperating in torturing terrorists is nothing short of scandalous."
"One might well wonder if this is not a punishment meted out to Poland by certain Member States of the Union because of Poland's close military cooperation with the United States."
"It could be interpreted as an attempt to bring Poland back into line."
"I should like to emphasise that we are paying undue attention to these allegations instead of putting more efforts into countering the terrorist threat in Europe."
"Mr President, colleagues will recall last week's exhibition in Parliament showing the multilingual attainment of the Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj, Romania."
"A wholly regrettable incident cast serious doubts over the commitment of the university to genuine multilingualism."
"In 2005, the university's senate passed a resolution that notices in the university should be displayed in all its three languages: Romanian, Hungarian and German."
"Yet attempts to introduce Hungarian language notices in the university building last week were prevented by force, and those involved were sacked by the university on Monday."
"There is a far-reaching contradiction here."
"Either the university is indeed multilingual, meaning that it must accept the full equality of the Hungarian language, or it is not, in which case it should stop pretending that it is."
"Mr President, in Ireland we are in the middle of a 16-day campaign to highlight the issue of domestic violence."
"It is essential that domestic violence is confronted and the proper services put in place, because domestic violence destroys millions of lives - those of women, children and sometimes men - right across Europe."
"Awareness-raising is the first step."
"Yesterday I had the opportunity to launch an exhibition of artwork and poetry, run by the Donegal Women's Domestic Violence Service, with contributions from three local schools: St Columba's, the Vocational School and Loreto Convent in Letterkenny in north-west Ireland."
"A related issue, and an important one for Ireland, is human trafficking."
"I call on our Taoiseach, who was here in Parliament today, to ratify immediately both the Council of Europe Convention on Trafficking in Human Beings and the United Nations Protocol on Trafficking in Persons."
"It has been assessed that Ireland is a transit and destination country for trafficking in women and children, and evidence suggests that organised criminal gangs are helping international traffickers establish trafficking routes in Ireland."
"Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to my constituent, Mr Alexander Litvinenko."
"Alexander was fearless in exposing the political gangsters that now run Russia, and the creatures of the KGB and FSB that still hold political office in Europe."
"For his bravery, he paid the ultimate price."
"In April, I made two speeches in this Parliament repeating allegations made to me by Alexander that Romano Prodi had been an agent of some kind of the KGB."
"Alexander told me that the key figure to understanding Mr Prodi's alleged relationship with the KGB in the 1970s was a man named Sokolov, also known as Konopkine, who worked for TASS in Italy."
"Since Alexander can no longer testify to this effect, as he was ready, willing and able to do, I am pleased to provide this service for him posthumously."
"(PL) Mr President, Poland would like any decision on replacing our national currency with the euro to be taken on the basis of a referendum, as was the case in Sweden."
"Pursuant to the 1994 Treaty on Accession laying down the conditions for the accession of Sweden, the Swedish authorities were required to replace the Swedish krona with the euro."
"Nonetheless, a referendum on the issue was held in Sweden in 2003."
"The result was a victory for those in favour of retaining the krona, so no action was taken to introduce the euro."
"The people of Poland are also entitled to a say on an issue of such vital importance for them."
"At present, as many as 36% of my fellow citizens consider that bringing in the euro would lead to price rises and lower living standards."
"They feel that introduction of the euro would amount to a political experiment with dubious benefits."
"We do not wish to hand Polish monetary policy over to the European Central Bank at Frankfurt."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion on raising consumer taxes on beer in yesterday's EU finance ministers' Council meeting does not only affect the Czech Republic."
"Beer and alcohol taxation should be viewed in context."
"We Czechs treat beer as an integral part of our national cuisine; beer has the same significance for us as fine wine does for the French."
"Just as many of my French-speaking colleagues would not think of having lunch without a glass of red wine, our traditional Czech lunch without a half-litre of high-quality Czech beer would, for me, be unthinkable."
"Yesterday's Czech veto on increasing consumer tax on beer should therefore be interpreted not only as a call for a comprehensive solution to the problem of taxation on alcoholic drinks but also as a call for all of Europe's problems to be addressed on the basis of equality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we want to fight against the negative effects of alcohol, we should establish the same taxation arrangements for all alcoholic drinks."
"If we want to revive European agriculture, we should reform the common agricultural policy and support all farmers equally."
"If we want to fight against terrorism, we must make sure that all Member States participate equally in that fight."
"(PL) Mr President, a year ago Russia imposed an embargo on certain Polish products of plant and animal origin."
"This was one of the reasons why Poland blocked negotiations between the European Union and Russia on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which was the subject of today's debate."
"Poland used its veto to defend its interests."
"The veto was a test of European unity against Russia and an expression of a strong spirit of EU solidarity."
"The European Union came through that test with flying colours."
"It showed that it cared about the interests of individual Member States."
"It was unfortunate, however, that it was only after the embargo had been in place for a year that Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission called on Russia to lift it, insisting that the ban on imports was unjustified."
"The effect of the Polish veto was to put on hold discussion on a new agreement with Russia, a matter of great importance to the whole European Union."
"The existing agreement dates back 10 years and is no longer relevant to current problems."
"A new agreement is essential to developing a common trade and energy policy with Russia, which is vital for the whole European Union."
"We can but hope that in future, the European Commission will help in resolving such unilateral bans imposed on Member States of the European Union by third countries as a matter of urgency, and that it will not be necessary to hold up key negotiations such as these, which involve common European Union policy towards Russia."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me, on the very day when we are facing the decision to slow down the negotiations for Turkey's accession to the European Union that we are greatly mistaken in telling our public that the reason for this slowing down is the Cyprus question - the details of which are probably known to one European citizen in 1 000, or one in 10 000."
"The truth is that this Europe of ours is frightened and is riding the wave of fear of those who put illegal immigration, fundamentalism and terrorism on the same plane and try to exorcise these enemies as if they were outside our frontiers."
"They thus use Turkey as a scapegoat."
"These are fears that should not be indulged."
"Instead they should be vanquished by a European political leadership that is capable of offering us a grand dream: a noble vision of a Europe that is secular, tolerant, modern and courageous, and thus capable of opening up so as to conquer the external enemies and above all the enemies within that cause ever-increasing worry."
"(PL) Mr President, Poland's refusal to sanction the Union's negotiating mandate on talks with Russia should not be understood as action against Russia, and certainly not as opposition to negotiating a sound partnership agreement with that country."
"We were forced to take that position, and we were aware that it is best to prevent matters from reaching such a stage."
"We would wish to avoid similar situations arising in the future."
"But I would appeal to the EU side, and in particular to the Council and to the Commission, and ask them to examine their consciences and review their response to this issue."
"I personally approached at least three Commissioners, those responsible for trade, agriculture and food safety."
"I raised the matter during plenary sittings, and also at the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I can confirm that there was a lack of cooperation between the relevant Directorates-General and Commissioners on the matter."
"Should similar situations arise in the future, support and joint action by all Member States will be of vital importance, in combination with the stance adopted by European Union institutions."
"Mr President, hard drug abuse is a worldwide disease for which there is no significant cure."
"People suffering from this serious illness must get their daily drug dose irrespective of cost or danger to themselves."
"They will steal, prostitute themselves or kill if necessary in order to obtain their required drug."
"In satisfying their dependency, they are providing life support for the flourishing drug-trafficking criminals."
"Many will die from the consequences of their addiction; others will suffer severe complications."
"Our society has been trying to deal with this problem using expensive police methods, partly due to ignorance and partly due to desperation."
"These methods have failed conclusively because drug addicts need the help of a doctor, not a policeman."
"Recently, some courageous senior police officers, including a deputy chief constable in the UK, have called for a change in tactics."
"They are right!"
"Let us consider taking the brave step of beginning to treat drug abuse victims by providing them with their required drug in a controlled medical environment, free of charge, free of complications, free of police and the law and free of crime."
"Let us at last start treating them like patients, not criminals."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to say something about the transmission of our sittings."
"I think it is intolerable, when this House meets together in plenary session, as it is doing now, when we have various things to discuss, such as - as we are about to do - the Seventh Research Framework Programme, that, for those who run this place, everything is more important than having this meeting transmitted via a proper system of cameras to the Internet and then to the media by way of the relevant interfaces."
"I would be much obliged to you if you were to give your attention to this matter, which affects the work done in this House."
"(LT) Events in the past few months in the area of European Union-Russian relations have shown that Europe is starting to recognise the reality."
"The strategic partner with so-called 'common values' has already been downgraded to a pragmatic partner, and it will not be long before Iran, with all of its energy resources, is also recognised as Europe's pragmatic partner."
"Support for terrorists will be no obstacle."
"We have already accepted that Russia's 'sovereign' statutes allow its agents to go around killing enemies of the regime anywhere in the world."
"We accept it when the Kremlin openly tells Europe that the values we cherish are artificial and warns against spreading the colonialism of European democracy."
"We keep silent and hope for that price to gain an Energy Charter, even though Russia has repeatedly said that it will rewrite the document in its own way and force Europeans to back down."
"Recently Poland tried to defend the principle of European solidarity, and the EU was displeased with that. We pushed aside the energy problem raised by the Poles and talked only about meat."
"Therefore, talk about a Constitutional consensus is futile while we have no consensus of solidarity in our minds and hearts, and while Russia can buy not only a gas pipeline, but also European politicians."
"That concludes the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme of the EC and the EAEC (debate)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, Honourable Members, Minister Lehtomäki, this evening and tomorrow at midday are important hours for Europe and European science."
"With your vote tomorrow, you, the Members of this Parliament, will demonstrate that the Europe of research is alive and kicking."
"We have worked hard together over the past year so that Europe's researchers can start working and making the best of the opportunities the new Framework Programme will offer them."
"Together, we have succeeded in delivering a Framework Programme that meets the objectives we set at the very beginning: ambition and excellence, a good balance between continuity and novelty and a strong basis for simplified rules and procedures."
"And, on top of this, we are delivering Framework Programme 7 on time."
"We succeeded in doing this despite some difficult circumstances, such as a late agreement on the Financial Perspectives and a rich debate on delicate ethical issues."
"We succeeded because we all share the strong conviction that cooperation in research lies at the heart of the successful knowledge society that we want Europe to be: a Europe that delivers growth and jobs and a good standard of living."
"The timely adoption of the ambitious FP7 will send a strong message to the scientific community, to industry and to the public at large."
"The message is: let us not lose time."
"Let us work together and realise Europe's potential for excellence."
"I would like to pay tribute to the Members who have made all this possible: the rapporteur for Framework Programme 7, Mr Buzek, the rapporteur for the Rules of Participation, Mr Busquin, and, for the part concerning Euratom, Ms Laperrouze; the rapporteurs for the seven Specific Programmes, Ms Riera Madurell for Cooperation, Ms Niebler and Mr Ehler for Ideas, Mr Pirilli for People, Mr Prodi for Capacities, Mr Guidoni for Euratom, Mr Hammerstein Mintz on the EC direct actions of the Joint Research Centre, Mr Caspary on the Euratom direct actions of the Joint Research Centre, and the long list of shadow rapporteurs and other Members who have been deeply involved."
"Our cooperation has been greatly facilitated by the skilful chairmanship of Mr Chichester."
"I learned a lot from him and would like to thank him."
"I would also like to acknowledge the hard work and good company of all the presidencies involved in the adoption of the programmes."
"I would especially like to thank the Finnish Presidency for its constructive role in the final phase of the process."
"Our negotiations have produced a solid and broad consensus among the three institutions on the main aspects of the Framework Programme 7 package."
"We have moved forward considering every single act as part of the same package, ensuring full political coherence within the overall package."
"You are more than familiar with the Framework Programme 7 and its content."
"I will therefore limit my remarks to some key issues."
"First, Mr Buzek's report on the Framework Programme 7, second reading."
"A lot of work has gone into reaching a balanced agreement the three institutions can agree on."
"I would like to express a heartfelt 'thank you' to the rapporteur for his openness and constant collaboration."
"The Commission accepts all elements of the agreement reached following the tripartite meetings."
"In particular, I would like to mention some of the most important issues on which we finally reached a proper balance."
"Firstly, the mid-term review and future decisions on the European Research Council, the appointment of its members and its administrative costs."
"The Commission has also issued a declaration on this."
"Secondly, the strengthened focus on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, to which more than half the energy priority budget will be devoted."
"I am particularly satisfied with the level of attention to be paid to energy efficiency in all thematic priorities."
"The Commission has also made a declaration on this."
"Thirdly, the redistribution of the budget in favour of the Cooperation, Ideas and People programmes and, within the Cooperation budget, in favour of Health, Energy, Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities, and Security."
"Fourthly, the approach for the release in two steps of the budget destined for the Risk Sharing Finance Facility."
"On the issue of European Union funding for human embryonic stem cell research, I believe we have agreed a very responsible ethical framework for a research programme covering so many different countries."
"It continues the ethical framework of Framework Programme 6, which has proved successful in practice."
"The Commission has made an extensive declaration on this ethical framework, which will be published in the Official Journal as part of the Framework Programme 7 package."
"The Commission will fully respect and strictly implement this declaration, which I consider to be an integral part of the agreement on Framework Programme 7."
"Accordingly, the Commission will not fund projects that include research activities which destroy human embryos, including for the procurement of stem cells."
"The exclusion of funding of this step of research will not prevent Community funding of subsequent steps involving human embryonic stem cells."
"Even if Article 6(3) of the Decision on Framework Programme 7 refers to derivation, the Commission will not fund derivation that involves destroying a human embryo."
"The agreement on ethics reflects a careful and responsible balance."
"The Commission calls on the European Parliament not to jeopardise this balance by any further amendment."
"I now come to the seven Specific Programmes, which set out the details of the two framework programmes for research."
"To a large extent, the modifications of the Commission's proposals were concerned with transposing the provisions of the agreed Framework Programme into the Specific Programme texts."
"Following these changes, the final draft Presidency texts on the Specific Programmes include a welcome mixture of Parliament's requests and the Council's own reflections, making these texts perfectly compatible with the Commission's position."
"For the Specific Programme on Cooperation, Parliament's amendments being put to the vote are, generally speaking, coherent with the Framework Programme text and largely acceptable."
"This is also thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Ms Riera Madurell."
"It was not an easy task to deal with such a broad range of fields with important research challenges."
"Let me just mention as an example of our strong cooperation the agreement reached on renewables and energy efficiency."
"For the Ideas programme, the European Parliament's main concerns, as reflected in the amendments and discussed intensively during the tripartite meetings, have been taken into account."
"Due consideration has been given, in particular, to: the ceiling on the administrative costs of the total budget; questions related to the management staff of the European Research Council; a clearly defined approach to the process of selection, term of office and renewal of the members of the Scientific Council; the reference to the review of ERC structures and mechanisms and the possibility of the Scientific Council appointing a Secretary-General."
"Once more, thanks to the rapporteur Ms Niebler and to Mr Ehler for their constructive work."
"For the People programme, the current Presidency text has taken on board a number of Parliament's amendments, which are fully acceptable to the Commission."
"I would highlight in particular those that refer to the importance of encouraging youngsters to enter the research profession, of helping them with a more stable career path, and making full use of women's potential."
"I offer all my thanks for the support given by the rapporteur, Mr Pirilli."
"On the Capacities Specific Programme, let me highlight some of those amendments that really improved the Commission's original proposal."
"I am referring, in particular, to those clarifying the role of RTD performers for activities under Research for the benefit of SMEs and the introduction of mechanisms for cooperation with national and regional R[amp]D support programmes. Concerning research potential activities, the addition of the reference to the associated countries clarifies and emphasises the eligibility of entities from these countries to participate in the actions supported under this specific programme."
"The constant and useful support received from the rapporteur, Mr Prodi, has been really appreciated."
"On the EC Joint Research Centre Specific Programme, I am glad to see that Parliament supports the priorities of the JRC as indicated in the Specific Programme."
"I agree with the majority of the amendments tabled, which are aimed at better defining the JRC mission in relation to its different activities."
"In particular, I agree to the request regarding the role that the JRC could play in providing a sustainable energy reference system and information on the reliability of the energy supply for Europe, as well as on the availability of renewable energy resources."
"Thank you for your excellent work, Mr Hammerstein Mintz."
"Regarding the Euratom Specific Programme, the text is broadly acceptable with some minor exceptions."
"Thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Guidoni, for his strong support for the Commission's proposal."
"Let me open a parenthesis here just to say that the ITER project has been of paramount importance."
"I must say that I feel fortunate to have been directly involved."
"Last week, I had the honour of taking part in the ceremony in Paris and, as I said there, I am confident that 'hard winds grow strong trees'."
"I also thought of you, Mr Busquin, at that moment."
"On the Euratom Joint Research Centre Specific Programme, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament and the Council support the Commission's approach and that the proposed amendments improve the Commission Proposal."
"And I share the request expressed by the Parliament that ""in view of the threat of a loss of knowledge and a lack of new scientists and engineers in the area of nuclear technology,[...] the JRC will implement a programme aimed at retaining knowledge, ensuring that this knowledge is readily available, properly organised and well documented."""
"Once more, thanks for the support received from the rapporteur, Mr Caspary."
"Let me now turn to the reports by Mr Busquin and Ms Laperrouze on the EC and Euratom rules for participation respectively."
"The Commission is very grateful to the European Parliament and, in particular, to the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and other Members of the ITRE Committee for their constructive attitude and strong commitment to reaching a good compromise with the Council, allowing the adoption of the EC Framework Programme 7 rules for participation at first reading."
"This follows the welcome precedent established under Framework Programme 6 and I am confident that this cooperation will continue in the future."
"The Euratom Rules will follow the same principles as those agreed for the EC Rules, taking into account the necessary adjustments due to the specificities of the Framework Programme 7 Euratom Framework Programme."
"Concerning the Busquin and Laperrouze reports, the Commission can accept all elements of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council."
"There is no doubt that the final text provides for significant improvements to the original Commission proposal."
"I would like to highlight the following elements of the agreement on the rules for participation."
"Firstly, the coverage and calculation of indirect costs, in particular the flat rate introduced for non-profit public bodies, universities, research organisations and SMEs."
"This flat rate is now fixed at 60% for the first three years (2007-2009) and thereafter the Commission shall establish a new flat rate reflecting an approximation of the real indirect costs of participants, but not lower than 40%."
"You have been very persuasive in convincing both the Council and the Commission in this respect."
"Secondly, the Participants' Guarantee Fund, which replaces collective financial responsibility, as it was known under FP6."
"This fund will be established by the Commission and will serve as a basis for exempting from verification participants - with the exception of project coordinators - requesting less than EUR 500 000 for a project."
"Moreover, no additional guarantee or security may be requested from participants or imposed on them, which will particularly help SMEs and other small users."
"Thirdly, the evaluation criteria will be clearly established in the Framework Programme 7 rules."
"Fourthly, there is the clarification regarding the financial statements, where the compromise agreed reflects Parliament and the Council's common goal of simplifying and limiting the number of certificates."
"Fifthly, the 75% upper funding limit for security-related research in the case of the development of highly reliable capabilities has an impact on the security of European citizens and is aimed at a limited number of public users."
"Parliament's wish has been fully satisfied in this respect."
"Finally, there are the access rights for European affiliates established in a Member State or associated country, which they will enjoy if they are required to use their own foreground under the same conditions as the participant to which they are affiliated."
"I reiterate my warmest thanks for your excellent work, Mr Busquin and Mrs Laperrouze."
"Before concluding, I would like to come to a topic that concerns at least some of you, as indicated by the amendments tabled."
"This concerns the participation of entities established in territories that are not internationally recognised."
"I understand that the aim is to exclude legal entities operating in the territories occupied by Israel."
"Since August 1996, Israel has been fully associated to the Framework Programme for Research and Development."
"Israel's research bodies are today valued and active partners in the implementation of the Framework Programme."
"The Commission has therefore recommended that the Council should renew the association agreement for the lifetime of Framework Programme 7."
"The association agreements in combination with the rules for participation give legal entities established in Israel the same rights and obligations concerning participation and funding as a legal entity established in a Member State."
"Only legal entities which are established within the internationally recognised territory of Israel can be considered as such legal entities under the text of the rules for participation before you."
"Legal entities established in the occupied territories cannot be considered as Israeli legal entities as defined by the FP6 rules for participation and the Association Agreement."
"The Commission will be very vigilant in this regard."
"Let me conclude by saying that I have really appreciated these 19 months of intense work and friendly collaboration."
"Many amendments have a special meaning for me, as they remind me of each of you, from Mr Liese's interest in children's disease to Ms Riera Madurell's and Ms Gutiérrez-Cortines's strong support for cultural heritage; from Mr Prodi's strong defence of the European Technology Platforms to Mr Hammerstein Mintz's and Mr Turmes's attention to renewable energy sources, and Mr Busquin's strong support for the Guarantee Fund, to mention just a few."
"I believe our cooperation bodes well for the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme and for the continued development of ambitious research and innovation policies that Europe needs and deserves."
"The debate today and the vote tomorrow herald the start of a new journey, one that I hope will see Europe cross frontiers and reach new horizons."
"Researchers will know that the European institutions are there to support them on this journey."
"Yes, this evening and tomorrow at midday are truly important hours for Europe and European science."
"We can truly be proud of what we have achieved and of the direction of the scientific journey on which we have embarked together for a better life for all Europeans and for the whole of humanity."
"(Applause)"
"Commissioner, I believe the sustained applause from this House at such a late hour reflects the depth of its satisfaction with the work of the Commission."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to mention that Mauri Pekkarinen, Minister for Trade and Industry, to whose field this Framework Programme belongs, will unfortunately not be here this evening owing to illness."
"For that reason, it is my pleasure and honour to represent the Council in this debate myself."
"On account of this illness, the Presidency will not have representation at ministerial level at tomorrow's press conference, but I am sure that it will go well."
"The European Community's Seventh Research Framework Programme is one of the most important of the Community's measures to implement the Lisbon Strategy and improve European competitiveness."
"The Community's measures for research and development are crucial if this goal is to be achieved."
"The budget for the Framework Programme over seven years is more than EUR 50 billion."
"That makes it the biggest Framework Programme ever in terms of budget and the longest-lasting one to boot."
"The interinstitutional agreement on the Community's financial framework was approved last May."
"As a result, we managed to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations conducted by Parliament and the Council, even though the timetable was a tight one."
"I do hope that we will keep to our ambitious timetable and conclude the legislative work for the Framework Programme by the end of the year."
"In this connection, I wish to thank the European Parliament for this compromise, and especially the rapporteurs Jerzy Buzek and Philippe Busquin, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy Giles Chichester, the shadow rapporteurs and numerous other Members who have been active in finding a common solution."
"In particular, I also want to thank Commissioner Potočnik for his constructive input in taking the negotiations forward."
"Finland, in its capacity as President of the Council, has been able to rely in its work on the results achieved by former presidencies, especially that of Austria."
"The Commission's draft proposal on the Framework Programme contained numerous new ambitious initiatives, such as the European Research Council, joint technology initiatives and the Risk-sharing Finance Facility."
"At times the negotiations were very difficult; for example, with regard to the initiatives mentioned."
"The outcome of the talks had meant a lot of work, considerable flexibility, and a genuine desire for compromise on the part of Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"With this in mind, I would like to mention that the Council in its common position adopted Parliament's amendment to the principles that steer financing for stem cell research under the Framework Programme."
"The Commission made a determined effort to find agreement, for which I want to thank the Commissioner."
"To my mind, the result is an ambitious, though balanced Programme."
"It provides an excellent basis for Community measures in the area of research and development for the next seven years."
"One important aim of the Commission's proposal for the participation rules was to simplify participation."
"In this connection, Parliament's dynamic role has made it a lot easier for all researchers to participate fully in the Framework Programme."
"The Finnish Presidency is happy to see that there are packages of amendments to vote on, amendments that are based on the outcome of the trilogue negotiations."
"I can confirm that these amendments have the approval of the Council."
"I hope, however, that the outcome of negotiations will remain unchanged in view of the other amendments tabled."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt the decisions on the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the participation rules relating to implementation in tomorrow's sitting."
"That way, the objective shared by all the institutions, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to have the Framework Programme start right at the beginning of next year can become a reality."
"This is also what Europe's scientific community is expecting of us."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the vote on the Seventh Framework Programme will take place tomorrow."
"Over the last 18 months, four Presidencies have worked on the programme, along with Parliament and the Commission."
"Each Presidency's input was valuable but particular thanks are due to the Finnish Presidency."
"As a result of excellent cooperation with the Council and of Commissioner Potočnik's remarkable personal commitment, for which I thank him, and also thanks to the technical support provided by the European Commission, a compromise acceptable to all was reached in October."
"Commissioner, we would like to thank you very much for the statement on stem cell research."
"This was very important to Parliament."
"The compromise amendments were passed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy without encountering any opposition."
"I should like to praise the shadow rapporteurs for the tremendous sense of responsibility and spirit of cooperation they demonstrated throughout."
"Thank you all."
"In terms of both work and cooperation this has been a very busy time for me."
"Thanks are due also to the coordinators and political advisers who oversaw the work, and to the eight parliamentary committees involved for their opinions."
"Along with the Seventh Framework Programme we shall today be debating specific programmes and the principles of participation."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy coordinated the work on these documents in the European Parliament, and I must thank the committee very much for its work too."
"Turning to the Seventh Framework Programme itself, I should like to highlight that Parliament has always approached it in a positive spirit."
"We did, however, introduce a number of improvements including new partial solutions."
"These are important to the Programme and were deemed beneficial by the Council and the European Commission, as evidenced by the compromise amendments."
"The structure and main provisions of the Programme represent an excellent response by the Union to the recommendations made in the Kok and Marimon reports and to the European Parliament's proposals contained in the Locatelli report."
"The Seventh Framework Programme will allow the goals of the Lisbon Strategy to be achieved in many ways."
"Everything will be based on the criterion of excellence in research."
"There are also new and interesting proposals, joint technological initiatives, drawing on the financial resources of European industry."
"This is a decisive move towards an innovative Europe, and is in line with the activities of European Technology Platforms."
"In addition, the European Parliament decided that research capacity in all the regions of Europe must be released if a genuine European research area is to be created."
"As regards the chapter entitled 'Ideas', it contains a definition of the European Research Council."
"This is a new undertaking designed to promote basic and high-level frontier research."
"The European Parliament has laid great stress on the need for this to be a fully autonomous Council, for its activities to be clear and transparent and for its administrative costs to be kept low."
"The next chapter is entitled 'People' and centres on scientists."
"If Europe exploits its human potential to the full, and in particular if it supports young scientists starting their professional lives, Europe will be in a position to spread its wings and prevent a brain drain."
"The development of European research infrastructure is a key issue."
"It features in the chapter entitled 'Capacities'."
"SMEs are another priority."
"In keeping with the Sixth Framework Programme, they are guaranteed a 15% share in research projects."
"Additional fast-track procedures and special programmes have been set up too, aimed at small projects."
"New technologies and innovation underpinned our amendments to this part of the Seventh Framework Programme as well."
"Work on the legislation is almost complete, and we must now turn to implementation of the programme."
"Simpler and more flexible procedures are a key issue, as is coordinating European programmes with national ones."
"Fragmentation of European research must be avoided at all costs."
"I am quietly confident that the Seventh Framework Programme will enable us to reawaken enthusiasm for the Lisbon Programme, and to overcome the well-known European paradox."
"In conclusion, I would like to turn to my fellow Members of the European Parliament and assure them that following adoption of the compromise amendments negotiated with the Council, the text of the Seventh Framework Programme fully reflects the priorities of the first reading."
"I therefore appeal for your support for these amendments, so that Parliament can speak in one voice about research, development, innovation and the future of Europe."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate in Parliament this evening on the Seventh Framework Programme and the prospect of its implementation is undoubtedly a moment for us to rejoice."
"It is an auspicious moment for the scientific community in particular, because this is, after all, the third most important programme of the European Union and one that enables the scientific community to take on a European dimension and motivates it to strive for excellence."
"Accordingly, one of our key aims is to avoid any lack of continuity from one programme to the next."
"Thanks to the joint efforts of the Finnish Presidency, whose perseverance and high-quality work I commend, of the Commissioner and the relevant departments of the Commission and of Parliament, working together in an excellent spirit of cooperation and fully focused on the defined goals, we have reached the stage at which we can launch the Seventh Framework Programme within the desired time frame."
"That is a crucial point."
"The second point is somewhat less gratifying, for the funding earmarked for the programme is lower than we had hoped."
"We cannot do anything about that."
"As the Commissioner emphasised, the Financial Perspective initially delayed the discussion of the programme and then fell short of what Europe needs to satisfy its ambitions."
"I shall repeat incessantly that tomorrow's Europe will be built on research and innovation."
"It is talked about, it is discussed, but the Member States are still unwilling to align their policies with these aims."
"It is certainly detrimental that the Framework Programme as proposed by the Commission has been cut by at least 25 to 30%, but, as we say in Belgium, 'Il faut faire avec' - one has to play along - which means trying to make the Framework Programme as effective as possible."
"In this respect, I believe, as Mr Buzek said, that the Commission's proposal has been broadly accepted and that the improvements and amendments that have been made all point in the right direction."
"For my part, I would still like to raise two matters."
"The first is the European Research Council, which is clearly an essential innovation in the field of European policy."
"It is indeed imperative that the scientific community should establish itself on a European scale and that the European scientific community itself should recognise the goal of excellence."
"This will give Europe a far higher profile."
"That is why we, along with Mrs Niebler and others, have devoted a great deal of attention to the way in which this European Research Council would operate."
"Another point that seems to be crucial relates to joint technological initiatives."
"This process, which is an extension of the technological platforms, is one of the keys to the competitiveness of European industry."
"It will therefore be very important for the Council, the Commission and Parliament to be able to carry out joint technological initiatives quickly in certain fields."
"Needless to say, it will not be possible for this to happen in every domain, but I believe the instrument is indispensable."
"Commissioner, you are a greater diplomat than I, so let me congratulate you explicitly on having secured an agreement with the Council on the continuation of stem-cell research, particularly as regards supernumerary embryonic stem cells."
"This is a balanced agreement."
"It follows on from what was achieved under the Sixth Framework Programme but is also well underpinned by ethical safeguards."
"The statement you have just made reassures the House that embryos will not be destroyed but that all the potential offered by stem cells, particularly spare embryonic stem cells, for the creation of tomorrow's scientific and medical knowledge will be preserved."
"I therefore congratulate you on securing this agreement."
"I should also like to point out to the House that we shall be voting on the specific programmes tomorrow too and that there are amendments on the table."
"I know that the procedure is different in the case of the specific programmes, for which we only deliver an opinion."
"Be that as it may, our votes on the specific programmes ought not to be inconsistent with the provisions adopted for the Framework Programme."
"Mr Buzek rightly said that Parliament supports the compromise proposals."
"Legitimate amendments have also been tabled by Members."
"The strength of support in the Chamber varies between the specific programmes and the Framework Programme."
"For the sake of the general coherence of the system, there must not be a divide between the specific programmes and the Framework Programme."
"Let me move on to the rules of participation."
"I shall be very brief, because you, Commissioner, have already highlighted the points that are new in relation to the proposal."
"There is, however, one precept on which I believe we are in agreement."
"The aim is simplification, and we have tried to develop things in that direction."
"Nevertheless, I am afraid we must remain humble and modest, for although the need to simplify is restated every time, those who have most experience of framework programmes sadly observe each time that they are not yet perfect."
"I am not sure that what we have done will be perfect."
"That will depend in part on your vigilance but also on us."
"We are here to help you to eliminate the constraints from other sources that complicate the process."
"For example, we sought to guarantee the participation of small and medium-sized businesses."
"This has not simply involved granting them up to 75% of total eligible costs; in the context of the guarantee fund, for example, they will not be required to submit to three-monthly audits to check whether they are eligible to participate."
"These, then, are the practical consequences, but they depend on implementation, because there are sometimes overzealous people involved."
"That is quite normal, but it can result in excesses."
"You will therefore have to ensure proper implementation."
"I am also thinking of the lowering of indirect costs to 60%."
"It may well be argued that this figure is somewhat arbitrary and that indirect costs should be calculated as accurately as possible."
"This, incidentally, is why a distinction is made between the first three years and the other years, but such a figure was essential in order to involve universities and SMEs from all countries, because accounting systems differ widely."
"Let me conclude by saying thank you very much for the work you have done, and thank you especially for making this Framework Programme possible, along with the rules of participation for the scientific community, through your capacity to engage in dialogue and through that of the Finnish Presidency, which has been excellent throughout this process."
"Thank you again, and I believe that we shall be here in good numbers tomorrow to carry your proposals and our amended proposals without any problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work performed by my fellow rapporteurs and, more generally, by the three institutions to pave the way for the rapid adoption of this research package."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is the key instrument for the creation of a European research area in which the aim is to devote 3% of GDP to research."
"It must serve to make national research policies cross-pollinate and complement each other and to promote consistency between the priorities of the Member States and the main aims to be defined by the European Research Council."
"In spite of a budget that is less substantial than the Commission and Parliament had hoped, this Framework Programme should be appreciated for its leverage."
"In view of the need to overcome difficulties in accessing finance, particularly for SMEs, the introduction of a funding mechanism and of risk-sharing is a step in the right direction."
"This mechanism must serve to increase the number of loans granted by the European Investment Bank and the financial institutions, to commit greater sums of money and to support riskier projects."
"As far as the Euratom rules of participation for the Seventh Framework Programme are concerned, my strategy was to work in close collaboration with Mr Busquin, rapporteur on the rules governing the conventional Framework Research and Development Programme, in order to preserve the similarity between these two drafts and thereby benefit from the codecision procedure."
"This is why the compromise amendments proposed to you are the fruit of discussions between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on Mr Busquin's report, adapted for the realm of nuclear energy."
"Two amendments, however, diverge from the Council's position."
"In fact, we wanted to specify, by means of Amendment 58, the selection and award criteria, such as scientific excellence, the ability to carry out the action successfully, relevance to the objectives of the specific programme, the critical mass of resources mobilised and the quality of the plan for the utilisation and dissemination of acquired knowledge."
"May I also draw your attention to Amendment 88 of this report, for which some Members have requested a separate vote."
"This amendment is not incompatible with the choice of Barcelona as the seat of the joint undertaking."
"Indeed the location of the seat is firmly enshrined in Council Decision 2006/458, and we approve of the choice."
"The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the other activities envisaged within the thematic area of fusion energy are implemented and managed separately from the joint undertaking so that the researchers can develop their creative potential."
"This separation would thus serve to maintain the integrated approach and the close involvement of the fusion associations, particularly through the European Fusion Development Agreement."
"This point was raised during the trialogues with the Commission and the Council on the rules of participation with a view to clearly defining the roles of each."
"The aims of this report on the rules of participation are to provide European support for research activities in the field of atomic energy in the hope of undoing the technological locks in the nuclear domain and particularly of fulfilling the promise of fusion for future energy production."
"I wish to express my very sincere thanks to Mr Busquin, who put his skills and experience at my disposal and who involved me in all the meetings at which the compromise amendments were negotiated with the Council and the Commission."
"Let me now conclude my remarks with a few words on the specific programmes that I have monitored more closely on behalf of my group."
"As far as the direct actions conducted by the Joint Research Centre are concerned, it is worth noting that the Centre's expertise has been extended into areas of considerable political and public interest, such as the development of alternatives to animal testing, social welfare, sustainable agriculture and protection of the environment."
"In the realm of nuclear energy, we would like the Joint Research Centre to play a greater role in fostering public awareness and providing training."
"It is also our wish that the Joint Research Centre should lend its expertise to the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"The specific programme on cooperation must help to address social, economic and environmental challenges by focusing on areas such as health, energy or the environment and climate change."
"The lengthy catalogue of amendments tabled by the European Parliament is akin, in some people's eyes, to a shopping list, and its very length indicates above all that a great deal of research is expected."
"Let us bear in mind the place and role of the European Union in the world but more especially in the lives of its people."
"A successful Framework Programme would be proof that the European Union is moving forward."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the People programme has found its way to this House after a year of dialogue, in-depth analysis and comparisons."
"My professional and political experience has brought ideas that are largely shared."
"They have been instilled into the programme and also incorporated in part into the body of the main legal instrument of Framework Programme 7."
"I accordingly express my profound thanks to Mr Buzek."
"The modern world moves at a very fast pace."
"The twentieth century was turbulent and exciting: it spanned three epochs, from peasant society to the industrial and post-industrial era, and went even further in its final decade."
"It was then that EU Heads of State or Government drew up their far-sighted recipe for the future."
"Lisbon 2000 was a ten-year programme, this being the time envisaged for the construction in Europe of a society of knowledge based on research and innovation."
"Today we must however take note that progress has been slow, although Framework Programme 6 has signalled a significant positive shift in European policy in this particular strategic sector."
"It is a modest effort when compared with the colossal achievements of the emerging economies: in the past fifteen years investments in the research and development sector in China have risen from USD 12.4 to USD 84.6 billion, an increase of 580%."
"Today China accounts for 12.5% of world trade and is the second largest world producer of advanced technological goods."
"Then we have India and the countries of the Indo-Pacific basin, the third axis of the technical and scientific world; this axis accounts for 36% of the high-tech products of the whole world, which is exactly double what the whole of Europe produces."
"Some analysts have reached a catastrophic conclusion, if this state of affairs is to continue: within twenty years, 90% of the world's scientists will live in an East Asian country."
"Thus Europe is lagging behind, when compared to the huge amount - in some cases more than 10% of GDP - that is invested in research and development by those countries."
"Europe is the prisoner of the selfishness of Member States, some of which even today invest less than 1%, while the average for Europe is less than 2% of GDP."
"This, very briefly, is the overall picture while we are getting ready to launch Framework Programme 7 - for which the European Commission has rightly asked Member States to provide a more substantial financial input."
"The People programme constitutes both the mind and the body of the entire legislative corpus: mens sana in corpore sano."
"Hence the idea of motivating researchers so as to motivate research."
"Framework Programme 7 will create the free, independent and motivated European researcher."
"This is the direction in which we should be moving: from recognising the research profession to giving it legal status; from a code of practice to the creation of a data-bank for selecting and employing researchers; from aligning remuneration with the best international standards; from equal opportunities for men and women, through measures to protect female researchers, to reconciling the needs of the workplace with family life; from initiatives to support family mobility to the necessary social security and insurance provisions, harmonisation of tax regimes, recognition of professional titles across EU states, freedom of movement and independence."
"These are the prerequisites for creating a European area of research and professional integration, given that after years of investment in training young researchers it is in our own interest to make the most of them."
"To abandon them would be to give a gift to the United States or China."
"The positive experience of Marie Curie Actions has appropriately been revisited and will continue, breathing life into a project that aims for excellence in the form of added value: it will have an impact on the organisation of the European research area."
"We also envisage collaboration and equal opportunities between the public and private sectors."
"Last but not least, intellectual property, towards which the Council has behaved a little like Pilate with Jesus of Nazareth: it has taken up the idea and turned it into a general rule."
"No, that is not how things should be done."
"If we truly wish to motivate researchers, we must give them a cast-iron guarantee that their rights over the intellectual property that they have created will be protected."
"This is possible - I shall insist on it when I make the request to the Commission and the Council - through contractual clauses under civil law that would protect the results obtained by research and by the individual researcher."
"To achieve excellence it is necessary to motivate people; and to attract researchers from all parts of the world it is necessary to offer attractive conditions."
"To combine quantity and quality and produce excellence in basic and technological research, as the People programme and the Framework Programme 7 intend to do, it is necessary to join up all the links and address all outstanding problems, to protect industry and private investments by stimulating them without extinguishing that driving force: the human being that is and remains the heart and mind of research."
"I thank you all for your kind attention, ladies and gentlemen and shadow rapporteurs - particularly Mr Chichester and my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who, by voting unanimously for my report, were sending out a strong signal to the Commission and the Council rather than acknowledging my modest contribution."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of over a year and a half's intensive parliamentary debate, we are about to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme and the specific programmes associated with it, and I am, today, grateful first of all, of course to our rapporteur Mr Buzek for his dedicated work, but also to all the other Members of this House who have made their own contributions to the framework programme and to the specific programmes."
"As rapporteur on the specific programme 'Ideas', I am, of course, particularly pleased and honoured that the Seventh Framework Programme, or, specifically, the 'Ideas' programme, sees the long-awaited inauguration of the European Research Council."
"Why do we need a European Research Council?"
"The intention is that it should reinforce basic research in Europe, thus closing a substantial gap in European research funding, which has, up to now, concentrated mainly on applied research, even though almost all the innovative and groundbreaking developments have come about as a result of basic research; one needs think only of such everyday things as digital cameras or CD players, which would have been impossible without scientists such as Max Planck or Albert Einstein to lay the theoretical foundations."
"The European Research Council, the ERC, needs to be a success if it is to attract leading researchers to Europe or to keep our own top European researchers here."
"If it is to do that, it must be able to do its work independently; this is something that we in this House have repeatedly emphasised, and the Commissioner has also endorsed the idea in his outline."
"What that means is that, in this European Research Council, it must be the researchers whose views count, the researchers who decide which basic research projects should get funding."
"It really is a new thing for politicians to say that they are going to keep out of the decisions as to what is worthy of support, and instead leave the decision-making to the research community, that is to say, to the researchers whom we vote onto the Council."
"I am also particularly proud that we have decided - or rather will, I hope, decide tomorrow - that the sole criterion for the spending of money by the European Research Council should be that of scientific excellence."
"This House has insisted from the very outset that the European Research Council should not be a pocket version of the DG Research."
"I trust that the Commissioner will understand when I say that I have nothing against the Commission, but, if the Research Council really is to be something new, the people who decide what it does must not be politicians, or, indeed the highly-qualified officials in DG Research, but researchers - and, yes, I know I am repeating myself, but I do think this is important."
"We in this House have had a hand in pointing the Council in the right direction, but, following an initial stage in which the Council is to be administered by the Commission, consideration is to be given to whether it is actually capable of operating on its own."
"Once that evaluation has been carried out, we will be able to come to a decision on the Council's final structure."
"I am very grateful that we were assured, in the trilogue, that this House would have the power of codecision as to what the Council's final structure should actually be like."
"We also saw it as important that the Research Council, when it starts work on 1 January 2007, should not become a closed shop, in other words, that it should be open and transparent and work in an open and transparent way."
"Our House has brought in a number of amendments to that effect, including stipulations that members of its scientific board should be elected in accordance with a rotation system, and we have, of course, by capping the Research Council's administrative budget, ensured that, at the end of the day, the money goes where it should go, that is, to the researchers, rather than being spent on admin."
"The Budget allocated to the European Research Council - amounting in any case to EUR 7.5 billion over seven years - ought, then, to be a good basis on which it can begin its work."
"The Research Council has what is needed in order for it to become the model of European success that we need, a beacon for European research."
"We also need something that has nothing to do with the Research Council."
"Tomorrow we have to send out an appeal to the effect that Europe's research community has to be one of the things whereby it identifies itself."
"Europe is a peaceful community; it is perceived as a community of values, a community founded upon the rule of law, with the European internal market as well as the economic and monetary union."
"There is only one thing that we lack, and Mr Busquin, with his European Research Area, really has opened up the right path."
"We must also become a European knowledge community, a European community of researchers."
"If the Research Council, the programmes, and that on which we are to vote tomorrow help to bring us closer to that, then we in this House will all have done a good piece of work."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally wish to thank the Finnish Presidency, Mr Buzek and all my other colleagues."
"I must of course give special thanks to Mr Potočnik, above all for all the work we carried out together on the basis of his suggestions for Framework Programme 7."
"I should like in particular to take note of his solemn promise to exclude any proposal involving infrastructure and firms that operate contrary to international law; and also of his solemn commitment to an integral element of Framework Programme 7 concerning the rules governing human embryonic stem cell research."
"We have done some important work together and have tried to do what is best for Europe."
"Framework Programme 7 offers us an excellent opportunity to set out the far-reaching effort to be made to regain our competitiveness at the level of the whole European Union, by fully implementing the Lisbon scenario."
"It is therefore appropriate to emphasise that this Framework Programme 7 demonstrates the pressing need to confront the question of research and development at EU level and should therefore be seen as the core of a socio-economic development policy for the EU."
"At present, competition involves actors operating at a continental - or at any rate regional-continental - level, and clearly goes beyond the single Member State."
"We must therefore pursue excellence on a European scale: that is the goal set by Framework Programme 7."
"All this is what we have been trying to do at European level."
"My insistence on this theme has been very kindly emphasised by the Commissioner: our collaboration has had some very personal and extremely important effects, which give one the feeling that for research purposes there must be widespread involvement by all business concerns, especially at European level, otherwise we shall not manage to reach our objective."
"Framework Programme 7 stands for our awareness that without a genuine common effort, we shall have to give up the idea of having manufacturing and development in Europe."
"This is the substance of what we are discussing today and this has been how we have all been personally involved in the enterprise."
"Clearly, certain things have had to be given up, but in the end some important work has been produced."
"I should like to clarify certain points concerning the Capacities programme."
"In my view the interconnections of Framework Programme 7 at regional level, in other words the ability to put together in synergy the resources of Framework Programme 7 and the Structural Funds, with the possibility of involving the regions in investment, could be truly productive in the future, both in research infrastructure and in the regions of knowledge and the regional districts of production."
"We therefore have, in my opinion, a range of instruments that together will help us to identify the approach that best fits all the issues on our agenda."
"I should also like to recall in particular the need to acquaint our citizens more closely with science at a regional level, as well as something that for me has become an idée fixe during my first few years in Parliament: teaching people to evaluate risk as an instrument of political choice, by involving citizens in a sense of overall awareness."
"That is what we have done, as effectively as we possibly could, and it is something to be satisfied about."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Buzek, Mr Busquin, the Council and the Commission for the important work they have done, and also my fellow rapporteurs for the other specific programmes, because, ladies and gentlemen, in this plenary sitting we will finally approve the Seventh Framework Programme, which defines the European Union's scientific policy for the next seven years."
"This is a fundamental issue within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, since, if our objective is to be a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, research, technological development and innovation are undoubtedly the main tools for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness."
"Our main objective has been to respond to the great challenges faced by our science, technology and innovation in order to reduce the gap separating us from our competitors."
"Our work has not been without difficulties, particularly following the agreement on the financial perspective which reduced our initial economic horizon."
"I believe that, on the whole, we can feel satisfied today, however."
"As rapporteur for the Specific Programme 'Cooperation', I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all of our fellow Members for their contributions, which have been crucial to the drafting of this report."
"The Specific Programme 'Cooperation', with a budget of EUR 32 500 million for the next seven years, represents 65% of the total budget of the seventh Framework Programme, which is a significant increase on the previous Framework Programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the world's largest international cooperation programme for R+D. This programme is intended to make the European Union a leader in strategic scientific and technological fields, by supporting cooperation amongst universities, research centres, companies and institutions, both within the European Union and with third countries."
"To this end, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy's proposal takes up ten major priority areas which offer a significant degree of continuity from the sixth Framework Programme, though improvements in approaches are proposed that we are convinced will provide research groups with easier access to programmes."
"The final text adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy which we are presenting to this plenum for its final approval essentially endorses the approach proposed by the European Commission."
"It includes powerful tools for stimulating private investment in research, though it calls for greater parliamentary control throughout the execution of the Programme."
"It also extends and stresses certain fields of research that were absent or not sufficiently represented in the initial proposal, and emphasises a series of horizontal structural aspects of the Programme that we believe to be essential."
"In this regard, I would like to stress that our proposal offers considerable progress in terms of the organisation of mechanisms to guarantee the participation of SMEs in all of the Programme's actions."
"A minimum objective of participation of 15% of the total budget has been set for them and the maximum contribution of all of the Community institutions, including the European Investment Bank, has been sought for the funding of projects in which SMEs participate."
"Our proposal makes the principle of scientific and technological cohesion one of the Programme's objectives and it points to the need to seek the maximum degree of complementarity and synergy with other national and regional funds."
"We are calling for mechanisms for establishing joint approaches to scientific and technological issues of interest to more than one field and also mechanisms for dealing with the complex problems of the thematic priorities for which a merely uni-disciplinary approach is not sufficient to produce significant scientific advances."
"Many aspects relating to joint technological initiatives have been improved as a result of the passage through this Parliament of the Specific Programme 'Cooperation'."
"These new instruments of technical and financial management and of participation in the Specific Programme 'Cooperation' required mechanisms for ensuring compliance with the criteria set for their constitution and transparency in the selection of priorities; they also required sound and efficient management."
"This report contains proposals for making progress on all of these aspects."
"I shall not go into the details of each of the thematic priorities - a lot of work has been done - but I would like to end by saying that I am one of those in favour of continuing with the funding of research with supernumerary human embryos in their early stages of development, since they are important to progress on infertility treatments and knowledge of the causes of congenital and degenerative diseases, and also to finding alternatives to animal testing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, through the work we have done over many months, we have tried to contribute to resolving some of the main problems faced by our science and technology."
"I believe that the result, the fruit of the greatest possible consensus, can be described as satisfactory."
"I would therefore like once again to thank all of my fellow Members for their contributions, as well as the European Commission, in particular Commissioner Potočnik, who is here today, for his constant help and cooperation."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Thank you, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mr Potočnik, for your open and cooperative attitude; thank you, Mr Buzek and all of the other shadow rapporteurs."
"We are all members of the seventh Framework Programme family, and in our family there has been a long and difficult birth, with little in the way of healthcare resources, but the baby has been born healthy, though a little under-weight."
"When will we grasp that European research is even more important than agricultural subsidies and building motorways?"
"That is not a rhetorical question; we must ask ourselves the stark question of what the priority is for the future of Europe, this Europe that wants to act, but cannot."
"We have set certain challenges in this Framework Programme and to a large extent we have covered them."
"We have made some progress in terms of opening up science, in terms of achieving the maximum transfer of scientific knowledge and technical information and supporting all incentives that promote the transfer of technologies, so that companies, civil society and universities can develop bridges between research and the necessary economic and technological renewal in our current European societies, thanks to this communication and thanks to the rules on the obligatory publication of results, the promotion of free software or the obligation, for example, to promote interoperability; we have made some progress, but we must continue to make more."
"We must also ask ourselves whether science is going to be by and for the people, because the opinions of researchers must be in line with those people who are not necessarily experts."
"In this regard, we should welcome the support and the important work of the science sector and society in this programme, the financial strengthening of this field and the fact that the programme is being opened up to civil society organisations."
"I also wonder whether small is beautiful in European science, because we all talk about SMEs, but is that empty rhetoric or a firm commitment?"
"SMEs create the majority of stable employment and are a source of economic stability."
"The support for initiatives such as that of creating clusters of small enterprises within the technological platforms is very much to be welcomed; it is very important that we have established a framework of 15% for small enterprises within all of the programmes."
"This is a challenge that we must fulfil; let us see whether we can turn our rhetoric into results."
"Will there be less bureaucracy and more transparency in this Programme?"
"Will there be clear and intelligible public access to information, which must be guaranteed for all processes of evaluation and funding of European Union projects?"
"The time has come for the European Commission to reduce the expensive administrative procedures, since they lead to the marginalisation of small research groups and small companies and NGOs, which are unable to afford them because of their size."
"We are demanding that they be simplified as soon as possible."
"We want no more excuses."
"The time has come to act."
"This Framework Programme has also meant a return to basics and therefore, with the establishment of the European Research Council, this Framework Programme will provide strong public support for basic research with medium- and long-term social and environmental objectives, led by renowned researchers who will defend their autonomy."
"We must ensure that this autonomy is respected by everybody, by both Parliament and the Commission."
"We Greens wonder whether, in view of the energy crisis, we will have the science for a good climate, which is what we need."
"It is very positive that there should be financial support for renewable energies and energy efficiency and that it has been increased by 250%, but at the same time we regret that it is still only a third of the sum received by nuclear research as a whole."
"We are also pleased that, with regard to social sciences, which are also sciences, this Programme offers firm support for socioeconomic research and multidisciplinary research."
"In general terms, we believe this Programme to be positive; cooperation amongst everybody is going to lead the European Union in the direction we need to take if we are to have longer and happier lives and if Europe is to play a more important role in the world."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have done it at last; the Seventh Framework Programme on Research is on the way, and, over the next seven years, the European Union will be investing a total of EUR 54 billion in research."
"Once we have adopted the specific programmes tomorrow, we - in this House, in the Commission, and the Council - will be able to look back, with our consciences clear, on almost two years worth of hard work."
"I would like particularly to thank all those Members with whom I have had the privilege of working, and in whom I had complete trust, as rapporteur on the Joint Research Centre's nuclear research activities over the past few months, and Commissioner Potočnik as well."
"We have not, unfortunately, achieved all the things we set ourselves - we have not, for example, managed to double expenditure on research - but the marked increase - of 50% - in the budget in comparison with the Sixth Framework Programme is a step in the right direction."
"This increase took some tough negotiating with the Council, and sends a positive message to our research institutes and will - it is to be hoped - foster a mood of optimism, but we missed by a mile the twofold increase for which we had hoped, and other economic areas in the world show considerably higher rates of increase in research spending."
"We will then fall still further behind in comparison with the USA and Japan."
"China and other states are continuing to catch us up."
"The consequences of that will hit us hard and also leave their mark on prosperity, the labour market and social peace."
"Europe's research programme is not, to be sure, the most extensive in the world, but it is one of the smartest, and the same can be said, in the nuclear research field, of the Joint Research Centre, on which I am reporting."
"As Commissioner Potočnik rightly pointed out in his introductory remarks, the Joint Research Centre is set to take over a crucial moderating role in many key areas of nuclear activity."
"One of these, firstly, is nuclear safety."
"Member States have different views on the use to which nuclear energy should be put; some of them are building new nuclear power stations, while others are not."
"Some are researching into new fourth-generation reactors, whilst others are not."
"These are things on which they are perfectly entitled to decide for themselves, but safety is not bounded by national borders, and that is why the Joint Research Centre must ensure that the necessary know-how is available at European level."
"Secondly, there is also the monitoring of security."
"Recent developments at international level have made issues of non-proliferation of nuclear technology and weaponry even more acutely important."
"These are pressing questions, and Europe must come up with an answer to them, so I am delighted to see that the Seventh Research Programme is to give a shot in the arm to the Institute for Transuranium Elements, which leads the world in this field."
"The same can be said, thirdly, of the maintenance and transfer of knowledge in the field of nuclear technology, which is of particular interest to me."
"We have to ensure that young and outstanding scientists across Europe can apply new ideas to addressing existing problems, but we also must not lose the knowledge already acquired, and so we have to ensure that existing and newly-gained knowledge is exchanged within the European Union to an even greater degree than it already is."
"The Joint Research Centre can certainly make a major contribution to this - and not just in the nuclear field."
"Although this House's work will be done once we have voted tomorrow, much remains to be done - by the Member States, by the Commission, and, above all, by the research community."
"I call on the Member States to invest even more money than before in research activities; for example, to avail themselves of the opportunity to invest money from the Structural Funds in developing research and development capabilities in their countries."
"The creation of new research structures is not a function of the Seventh Research Programme, but rather a task for the Member States and the Structural Funds."
"It is fortunate that the Seventh Research Framework Programme can concentrate properly on excellence in research."
"I call on the Commission to implement the Programme without delay;"
"I also call on them to establish clear, transparent, well thought-out, effective and fair tendering procedures, to assess them - or cause them to be assessed - in an objective manner, and to implement them in practical and unbureaucratic ways."
"I am sure that the approach that we in this House have come up with is far from being the worst."
"Finally, though, let me call on the European research community - the people who do the research, the people who work on the details, the people who find things out - to make use of what this research programme offers;"
"Parliament has done its work, and now it is up to you to make progress with your research and do something vital in giving Europe a peaceful, free and prosperous future."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Potočnik and the Finnish Presidency, which has now been handed the baton in a piece of work that has taken several years to do."
"Before I speak about the specific programme for which I am the rapporteur, that is to say Euratom, I should like to express some thoughts about Framework Programme 7 and its specific programmes."
"I must obviously congratulate Mr Buzek and all the other rapporteurs for their excellent team work, which has enabled us to launch Framework Programme 7, if only at the last possible minute."
"At the same time I feel rather sad that we have not made that leap of quality, namely that doubling on which we pinned so many hopes."
"That would have sent out a strong signal of Europe's importance and above all of our conviction that we shall reach the Lisbon objective."
"The doubling has not happened, but we are nevertheless trying to produce a result."
"I shall start with the last comment made by Mr Potočnik on cooperation, in connection with the concern that I have expressed on behalf of myself and my group about the risk inherent in financing organisations or entities, under the aegis of Framework Programme 7, that have been set up or that are functioning in violation of international law."
"The matter was discussed recently by Parliament with particular reference to the entity that has been set up in the occupied territories - the West Bank, Gaza and eastern Jerusalem - but it applies more generally."
"I must emphasise that this concern relates also to situations that have emerged, for example, in scientific bodies, who can be asked to tender under Framework Programme 7 even if they are founded on national legislation that is in breach of international law, by for example preventing people from certain ethnic and religious groups from engaging in research."
"I believe that this is the problem on which the Commission must express a view."
"I was not satisfied with the response given in relation to this, since it seems to me to be limited to a very specific sector, whereas I think that it should apply more generally."
"As far as the specific programmes are concerned, I am generally satisfied with most of the results achieved and I should in particular like to emphasise the attention given to researchers."
"Indeed I consider that a great deal of what is done in our complex present-day society depends more and more on the human factor."
"It is clearly impossible to think of European research without thinking of the researchers and their need for mobility, training and status, which are set out in the European Charter for Researchers."
"Framework Programme 7 will have to implement the provisions that guarantee the best working conditions for European scientists, not least in order to limit and, if possible, reverse the trend of the brain drain to other parts of the world."
"I greatly welcome the effort made to invest in basic research through the creation of an entity that would be independent of the Commission, charged with giving its judgment on the merits of a scientific proposal to be financed under the aegis of Framework Programme 7."
"The efficacy of this new body will be measured in terms of whether it can be authoritative in selecting proposals and in earning the respect of the scientific community."
"Only thus will it be able to attract innovative proposals and be in a position to finance ambitious projects that will enhance the quality of European research."
"Operational transparency, ensured partly through Parliament's involvement in appraising its actions, will be essential for this body's success."
"I should now like to devote the remaining minutes to the Euratom specific programme."
"I agree with the Commission's position, which was also expressed by Mr Buzek concerning the Euratom framework programme, and I think that Europe must invest in developing fusion so that it becomes an indispensable energy source in the long term: unlimited in quantity, ecologically acceptable, financially competitive and capable of making a substantial contribution to a sustainable and safe form of energy supply."
"ITER is a fundamental stage in the route towards the use of fusion energy."
"After lengthy negotiations on the choice of the site for the reactor, the project's partners have at last signed the international agreement on ITER."
"The positive conclusion of the negotiations, namely the decision to build ITER on the European site of Caradache in France, requires the adoption of decisive and consistent measures on the part of the EU under the umbrella of the present and subsequent framework programmes."
"We therefore need to set up a European agency for ITER, in the form of a common enterprise under the aegis of the Euratom treaty, to supply the means for fulfilling our international obligations arising from the ITER agreement."
"This means setting up the machinery and projects for collaboration with Japan."
"This agency, with its headquarters in Barcelona, should have the setting up of ITER as its primary objective."
"However, I think that the agency's remit should be limited to this, and I do not share the Commission's position of entrusting the whole field of research on fusion to a single agency."
"I do not wish to weaken the role of the agency, which I regard as important, but I think it is essential to help it to meet its objective - which is complicated enough in itself."
"Furthermore, I think that European research needs to be more independent, an opinion that in some ways applies also to the European Research Centre."
"That apart, the associated bodies of the European Fusion Development Agreement have proved over the years to play an essential role."
"If Europe has the leadership of this programme, that is because it has demonstrated in the field the high quality of the research that it carries out."
"Setting up ITER is only the first step, given that we must use it - and use it to best advantage - through a new generation of researchers and high-value research in Europe."
"This can be guaranteed by keeping research separate from execution."
"Research should be carried out with existing mechanisms alongside the setting-up of ITER."
"This is why I believe that it is important for my proposed amendment to be approved by this House, just as was the case with the Buzek report."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs and my colleague in Committee on Budgets, Mrs Xenogiannakopoulou, for her thorough and insightful opinion."
"I wish to express my unreserved support for the collaborative research and development programmes in Europe."
"I see this as a very important policy area that has direct impact on the way the EU develops as a global economy and the way we are regarded by the rest of the world."
"The Seventh Framework Programme, as we have heard, is the biggest EU research programme to date and it pulls all the research-related EU initiatives under the roof of its EUR 53 billion programme."
"The Commission's initial request was for EUR 70 billion, which was a huge increase on previous years."
"However, we should not forget that this is a seven-year programme, not a five-year one like its immediate predecessor, and that its resources will be stretched across 27 Member States rather than the 15 and then 25 of the previous programmes."
"We should also understand that doubling the FP7 reflects the clear importance of science and research to the development of the EU as a global player and as an economic power."
"If we want to be competitive, we must walk our talk by investing in the areas that we know are key to our growth."
"Unfortunately, I do not think the Council actually believes this and it is a pity that it did not support the Commission's request for EUR 70 billion."
"Despite all the hype we have heard from the Council and all the noises it has made about the need to achieve the Lisbon goals and the importance of pushing our research and development spending up to 3% of GDP - which is still a long way behind Japan and the US - is it not incredible that the final figure agreed by the Council takes the spending up to only 1.5%?"
"What is more astonishing is that the Luxembourg Presidency's original proposal was to cut research and development even more significantly."
"Thankfully, this option was rejected by many states, including my own, which saw the clear link between research and development and the growth and competitiveness of the EU."
"This policy area was revisited by the UK Presidency, which put forward proposals for increasing spending."
"I very much welcome the increase, but I lament, as I said earlier, that it is nowhere near the amount requested by the Commission and Parliament."
"The launch of this programme presents us with a real opportunity to learn from and correct past mistakes."
"One area upon which we need to focus our efforts is that of reducing the duration of funding procedures."
"The present procedure is ridiculously long."
"It is not just organisations in my region in the West Midlands which have witnessed this: the European Court of Auditors reported delays of between eight and nine months."
"This is unacceptably long and it has to be drastically reduced."
"The lengthy procedure causes many problems."
"Not least of these is the necessity for a long pre-financing by participants."
"It is an issue we need to address urgently."
"Moving on, late payments are particularly detrimental to SMEs."
"In this House we are constantly talking about SMEs that we want to support, and they are the fundamental driver of growth in the EU."
"However, their budgets are hard pushed to cope with such delays."
"Yet the Commission tells us that SMEs, as I said, must be targeted and actively encouraged to get involved."
"Perhaps before we try to encourage them, we should ensure that we do not actually discourage them."
"Therefore, please make the payments promptly."
"The late payments also call into question the principle of annuality."
"Since the Commission has acknowledged these problems, I would strongly urge it to prioritise resolving them."
"The Commission must ensure that it evaluates, selects and awards funding in an efficient and effective way."
"Moreover, in order to plan properly, participants need to know in advance the date on which the decision will be taken."
"This can be achieved only if future methods and procedures are simplified to speed up selection."
"This would lead to a much more coherent approach, it would avoid unnecessary bureaucracy for participants and speed up the negotiation of selected proposals."
"It would also lead to increased transparency by facilitating access to the programme to the very many organisations that I have mentioned before."
"One barrier to this is the double verification system."
"The Commission should set up a single verification and certification system and adopt and publish specific rules that can be seen to be clear and fair to all the interested parties."
"In view of this badly needed simplification of access to funding, I support the proposals of the Committee on Budgets to create a database for the submission of applications and encourage the Commission to apply the principle of proportionality as regards the documents it requires."
"However, I would also urge the Commission to pay attention to the way the programme is controlled."
"Control mechanisms need to be coordinated and, as I have said, we must avoid unnecessary duplication and ensure that the overall cost of control is proportional to the benefit that it brings."
"In conclusion, let me remind the Commission and the Council that this programme is supposed to be for the benefit of the citizens and to promote scientific excellence across the European Union."
"I do not think that, in view of this, we should try and make all the applicants jump through hoops to participate."
"On the contrary, we should rapidly award funding to those in Europe who show real innovation and initiative and help them to discover new funding opportunities to increase our competitive advantage vis-à-vis the other areas of the world."
"As I and all my colleagues have said, everyone recognises the vital role that research and development play in helping the European Union face the challenges presented by the rapidly developing economies of China and India."
"For this reason, I would strongly urge the Commission to put every euro this programme has been granted to the most effective use possible and ensure that there is a one hundred per cent implementation rate."
"Finally, I would also call on our leaders in the Council to look beyond the EU borders and compare ourselves with other areas in the rest of the world and try and revisit this policy to increase resources sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, innovation and knowledge are now enshrined as a pillar of development for the European Union."
"For such a provision to bear fruit, however, investment in human resources in the field of science and technology, and particularly in young scientists, needs to be seen as crucial and of the highest relevance if we are to achieve the Lisbon goals that we have set for ourselves in the next financial package for 2007-2013."
"The reality is that European brains have been abandoning the EU and taking refuge mostly in the United States, where, more often than not, they are guaranteed better working conditions - one might say better laboratory conditions - as well as better pay."
"Thus we are starting out late and at a disadvantage, and we must therefore make every effort to change this scenario."
"The aim is to succeed in getting not only new researchers to stay, but also many of those we have already exported to return, and to establish themselves in our old continent, which is trying to put on a new face."
"We also have to succeed in attracting researchers from third countries by means of new incentives and the mutual recognition of qualifications."
"I should like to end by voicing an appeal: researchers, who are the heart and soul of the Seventh Framework Programme, should not be limited to a mere minute in this Programme, which is all that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been given in this debate."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, agricultural research is getting a chapter to itself within the context of support for research."
"Between 2007 and 2013, some EUR 1.9 billion will be available for innovation in food, agriculture and biotechnology."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the explicit reference to agricultural research, which, along with energy research and research into the environment, now has additional options available to it when it comes to getting support from Europe."
"In so doing, we are not only making a contribution to sustainable agricultural research and development, but are also helping farmers to implement the 2003 agriculture reform and change over to production systems that are competitive in international terms."
"Innovative agricultural and food production pilot schemes, agricultural institutions, ministries, artisanal associations and guilds should now all prepare themselves to benefit from the innovative options Europe affords them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will take under four minutes."
"I should simply like to emphasise one point, namely the great importance attached in this Framework Programme to the relationship between science and society: we need only think of the steps proposed to promote equal opportunities for women in scientific research up to the most senior levels, the 'Youth' action programme, the relationship between citizens and science as well as between the education and training schemes inspired by humanist culture and the demands of scientific progress."
"I want to emphasise that science - this is a truism - has intrinsic worth: it is not simply worthy in the utilitarian, productive and competitive sense, though these aspects are also important."
"Science must be regarded as a common good and its achievements must be accessible to everyone."
"I believe that the EU, precisely at the moment when expanding its scientific activity means addressing new issues and aiming at quality, must also keep an eye on the rest of the world and not withdraw into itself: this is an essential part of its role."
"In fact the achievements of science must be accessible to everyone: the world situation is highly unsatisfactory and a large part of research and knowledge relates to the wellbeing of 10% of the population, while the remaining 90% derive no benefit from it."
"There are clearly important measures to be adopted, including the limitation of patents when these affect the wellbeing of the community, especially in the context of diseases."
"I will conclude by saying that as far as the ethical problem is concerned, I fully concur with what Mr Busquin said: there must be consistency between decisions taken in this House and those adopted in all other forums."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I feel rather humble in the presence of this galaxy of rapporteurs and draftsmen."
"I understand some kind words were uttered earlier this evening and I should like to reciprocate by thanking the Commissioner, the Presidency and my colleagues, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, for their very constructive engagement in this project."
"We have worked very hard and I like to think that we have pressed the Council and the Commission to concede a little more than they would like and perhaps not as much as we would like: that is good business."
"I share some colleagues' regrets that we were not able to persuade the Council to dig deeper into our taxpayers' pockets to increase expenditure on research."
"It is a pity that it did not match earlier rhetoric."
"I strongly hope the compromise package will be adopted tomorrow."
"It will give a powerful signal to the research community that we can carry out our business and have the legislation in place on time."
"The particular aspects of the framework that I find both new and exciting are the European Research Council and the concept of excellence, because we need both to enable ourselves to compete in the wider world."
"I welcome the encouragement for SMEs, early-stage researchers and for women in science, as well as the joint technology initiatives, especially for Mr Prodi."
"In conclusion, I should also like to thank another European Union institution, namely the Court of Auditors, for its contribution to the work on the rules for participation in responding to our invitation to give an opinion."
"Hopefully, as a result, we will have made participation in the Framework Research Programme simpler, clearer and more accountable."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and especially Mr Busquin, who is sitting here near me."
"Hopefully, the Research Framework Programme will help us take a few steps closer to the Lisbon objectives."
"Parliament has given its support to this excellent package, and my group does too."
"The billion euros in the venture capital fund will support small and medium-sized companies, and these very SMEs must be able to challenge the big companies and give employment to people."
"There is every reason to increase investment in research."
"Despite that, only one country has invested more than 1% of its budget in research and development, and that country is Finland."
"EU investment in research is more sporadic than that of the United States of America, even ignoring money used there for research into defence."
"With the new Research Framework Programme, there will be new areas for research and new initiatives."
"The technology initiatives will improve opportunities for the world of business to participate in the Framework Programme."
"The European Scientific Council of the European Research Council (ERC) will be responsible for managing the clearest basic research."
"The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, for its part, will focus on support for enterprise."
"The European Institute of Technology may bring into the equation a top university to compete with other universities."
"Even the Joint Research Centre, which now has more than 2 000 researchers, is active in these fields."
"I fear that all this work will fragment and there will be unnecessary overlap."
"Applicants are confused and wonder where they are actually applying: the moon, perhaps."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to tell Parliament how it will attempt to organise the European architecture in Research and Development, so that confusion does not slow down development."
"The ERA-NET scheme is an important part of this work, but do we already have too many Community initiatives?"
"Does the Commissioner on the right know what the Commissioner on the left is doing?"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Research is an important pillar of Europe's drive for the growth of not only the economy but society as a whole, because it attaches value to human capital and the results of research are targeted towards improving social life, health and knowledge."
"These positive aspects cannot conceal or make us forget that there is a lack of an ethical perspective in connection with stem cell research, in the way that Article 6 is worded."
"We do not wish to impose limits or obscurantist filters: we simply wish to say that science and research must also have rules and guiding criteria."
"The guiding criterion is the pre-eminence of mankind, if we are not to reverse ends and means."
"The ethical aspect cannot be left out of consideration when research reaches into our genetic inheritance and science comes close to the origin of life itself and thus the beginning of a human life."
"The belief that research disciplines itself and finds guidance only in itself and in its development is illusory and short-sighted."
"We do not agree with the wording of Article 6, because we cannot accept that European funds should go towards research that could destroy an embryo."
"For this reason it was important, Commissioner, to stipulate a cut-off date, a definite time limit on the use of cell lines that have already been extracted."
"There has been no such time limit."
"But it would have been real proof that there was no desire to use embryos ad hoc for research in future."
"That has not been done; this is why I am expressing a critical judgment."
"However, there is a point in the annex to the statement that expresses the decision not to finance research involving the destruction of embryos."
"We ask the Commission to remain true to these words, so that they are not merely an empty statement, and we also request that the Commission's statement and its annex, which otherwise risk being mislaid and separated from the regulation, should be permanently attached to the regulation at the express wish of the Commission and the Council."
"They should form an integral part of the regulation, as it seems to me that the Commissioner stated in his speech."
"In addition we should like this wish to be given formal legal force, so that it is not entrusted merely to a political desire that goes no further than the nocturnal records of this House."
"Tomorrow will be an important day for research, although in my opinion we must stress that those of us who have sometimes found ourselves facing an insurmountable obstacle in this matter are still unhappy."
"We shall continue to oppose any solution adopted for stem cell research that lacks clarity or respect for human values."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, society makes progress not because of institutions but because of courageous and intelligent women and men taking initiatives and then sticking to them."
"Commissioner, you are one of these men."
"You have understood climate change and the depletion of energy resources."
"These are the challenges of the 21st century."
"Colleagues, we are in a race against time."
"We may have only 10, 15 or a maximum of 20 years to get out of a trap which will definitely cause bloodshed, wars, weather anomalies and diseases."
"It will be a disaster for this planet."
"The only way out will be to invest massively and rapidly in energy-intelligent use and in renewable energy sources and materials."
"We have brokered a deal to get at least 50% of the money for non-nuclear research to renewables and end-use energy efficiency."
"We have a deal on three issues."
"Firstly, energy efficiency has to be a horizontal priority all over our research - it is about material research and ICT, which has to involve the energy and resource dimension."
"Commissioner, you must set up a coordination body to make this happen not only on paper but also in reality."
"Secondly, on renewables, we in Europe are the leader as regards technology in that area because we put money into FP4, FP5 and FP6 to invest in wind, photovoltaics and biomass."
"I want FP7 money to make Europe the world leader in offshore wind, solar thermal electricity and marine technology."
"We have to move towards that."
"The third part of our deal is that these issues need to be monitored."
"Finally, ITER is the bad decision."
"Why?"
"Because somebody told me that the less chance there is of a technology breakthrough, the bigger the chance to have an international agreement."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when I look around me, I get a sense that one of Murphy's laws is in operation; that is, the more important the issue, the less attention gets paid to it."
"This is despite the outstanding work of Commissioner Potočnik, and Mr Buzek and his colleagues, who have been among the first ever to look at the needs of the new Member States, where science and research are appallingly under-funded."
"One of the tasks ahead of us is to concentrate more resources on areas where they will achieve a multiplier effect, as in the case of nanosciences and nanotechnologies, where the resources are somewhat less than had originally been planned."
"Where we must work hardest, however, is in the new media policy, in order to boost the prestige of science and scientists in the Community, to promote what is referred to in America as the pioneering spirit and to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme becomes the flagship of the Lisbon Strategy."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Seventh Framework Programme is a sine qua non if Europe is to become a leader on the modern economic scene, for the benefit of the welfare and health of its citizens and of environmental protection."
"The economic and political situation and environmental protection do, however, call for definition of the priorities to benefit from particular financial and organisational support."
"One of these priorities is reducing reliance on gas and oil."
"Supply problems and increased prices for these fuels have a negative impact on the economy and on living standards."
"In the USA, biofuels research and development has enabled these fuels to be developed and engines running on biofuels to be introduced."
"It also allowed fuel imports to be cut and created a huge demand for agricultural products, thus increasing the profitability of that sector."
"The construction of new nuclear power plants in response to the needs of the European energy system, and also of plants generating electricity from wind, water and solar power will secure economic stability."
"They will also reduce the greenhouse effect and limit damage to the environment."
"Coal gasification and coal liquefaction have similar benefits."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, no respect is ever shown in this House for the principle of subsidiarity, and no proposal is ever put forward to return political power from the EU to the Member States."
"Where research is concerned, however, there are valid economic arguments in favour of more work being done by the EU."
"A pure market economy results in too little research because the benefits of research are enjoyed by everyone while its costs have to be borne by individual companies."
"It is therefore worth taxpayers' while funding basic research."
"If several countries join forces, it is still more worthwhile in socio-economic terms because a larger portion of the benefits then comes back to the taxpayers."
"It is an excellent idea to set up the European Research Council and to facilitate the movement of researchers within the EU."
"We must, however, reject state intervention and increased bureaucracy."
"What are required are more research resources, together with transparency and freedom of movement."
"The issue at hand here is research management, yet politicians, bureaucrats and new EU institutions are nonetheless seeing the scope of their activities extended."
"Allow me finally to draw attention to the grotesque way in which resources are distributed."
"The money available under the Seventh Framework Programme amounts to one seventh of the costs of the EU's agricultural policy."
"Research appropriations are vitally important to the future of Europe."
"In contrast, the agricultural policy squanders resources, exploits European consumers and exacerbates world poverty."
"A doubling of research appropriations, a 50% cut in agricultural subsidies and a 40% reduction in the fee payable to the EU would be blessings to offer a silent prayer for."
"Mr President, I do not want to spoil the party here tonight."
"I think we can be proud of what we have achieved - the European Research Council, the search for excellence in different programmes - but I think it is necessary to state tonight that this is not enough."
"It is not enough if we compare it with what we should be able to do at European level, and it is important for the representatives of the Council as well as for you, Commissioner, to remember that and to underline that we cannot wait for another seven years to step up the efforts we need in order to keep up with other parts of the world if we are to be the world's leading knowledge economy."
"As a shadow rapporteur I am proud of what we have achieved from our side."
"We wanted to make it easier for SMEs to have access to research programmes, and we have achieved that."
"We wanted to have better funding for SMEs, and we have achieved that."
"We wanted to ensure that universities were able to get into the projects without losing money through indirect costs, and we have achieved that."
"We also wanted less bureaucracy, and we have achieved that."
"We wanted to free up opportunities to use intellectual property rights, and we have achieved that."
"We are happy about what we have achieved, but that demonstrates that we need to take further steps."
"(FR) Mr President, in the nick of time, Parliament has pulled the fat out of the fire by adopting the Seventh Framework Programme and avoiding a blank year for European research."
"It also enables us to respond to that most exciting of challenges, network intelligence."
"Let me highlight some welcome advances: the adoption of priorities associated with people's everyday lives, such as health, energy, the environment, support for information and communication technology, the impact of which cuts across all the policies of the Union, the increased consideration given to small and medium-sized enterprises, the engine of competitiveness, through the risk-sharing fund, and, lastly, a prospect of future resources that inspires confidence, with the enhancement of the Marie Curie scholarships and the creation of the European Research Council."
"As the shadow rapporteur for the Ideas programme, I am delighted that the European Research Council, which is to function through and for researchers, will represent a new form of scientific governance and will fall within the realm of codecision."
"The European Parliament has demonstrated unity and responsibility."
"At the same time, I regret that the budget is not sufficient to make up the leeway on our American and Japanese competitors, who are investing more than twice as much on research as we are."
"The Council must hear our message in support of yours, Commissioner."
"The merit of this Framework Programme is that it gives globalisation a human face, and that is surely worth an additional financial effort."
"Let us fix a date for the revision of the Financial Perspective!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that we dream of is first and foremost the Europe of human rights, then the Europe of the market; first the Europe of solidarity with smaller nations, then the competitive Europe."
"I thank you therefore for the clarifications you have given us this evening, but you know that some explanations remain incomplete, just as the wording of the common position is ambiguous."
"You also know that European funds will provide an incentive for destroying human embryos."
"I recall with pleasure the moment in 1989 when the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted together for an undertaking that there would never be experiments on human embryos except for the purpose of saving the embryo itself."
"Today we are reversing this position: it is said that the money is needed so urgently that there is no margin for further deliberation, and yet all that is needed is for the Council to accept the genuine interpretation set out in the two amendments that many of us have tabled."
"I hope that these amendments will be accepted, at the very least in the specific programmes."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my fellow Members and draw attention to some of the positive features of the Specific Programme, 'Capacities'."
"Firstly, investment in infrastructure is an essential precondition of innovation and the development of new knowledge."
"With a European perspective on research infrastructure, researchers will increasingly be able to obtain mutual benefit across Europe's borders from new investment."
"New and specialised forms of research infrastructure are expensive, and it should therefore be possible for as large a number of researchers as possible to make use of them."
"With common resources, we shall be able to secure better access to the most recent tools for all European researchers."
"Secondly, I think it important that the programme appropriate resources to better integrate the dissemination aspect into research."
"If society is to reap as many of the benefits of European research as possible, we must ensure that the results of research make a difference to individuals, authorities and industry."
"High-quality research dissemination also helps to legitimise society's investment in research and to awaken young people's interest in becoming researchers."
"In this connection, it is also important to point out that the programme focuses on women in research and on increasing women's opportunities to enter the research world."
"The under-representation of women in that world is well documented, especially by the Commission's own units for women and research."
"At both Community and national levels, we must therefore work to bring about a situation in which a research career becomes an attractive option for both men and women."
"Thirdly, I think it important not only that research staff and directors of research institutes should be exchanged between partner organisations in the Member States but also that the principle should be extended to include partners in associated countries and third countries."
"The EU's framework programmes are open to a number of partner countries and, in the Seventh Framework Programme, the Commission wants to involve these countries to a greater degree than hitherto."
"The partner countries' participation in the exchange of research staff will definitely add value to European knowledge-sharing."
"(ES) Mr President, European research has gradually dedicated more room to issues relating to the environment, to people and to culture, thereby attaching more importance to their situations and to their conservation and survival."
"The attention paid to historical and cultural heritage is an example of this."
"I would like to thank those people in the Commission who have supported it."
"The same should be said of the inclusion of the entertainment and multimedia industry, information technologies and social sciences in the programme, as well as the innovation of introducing research relating to intelligence and the fight against terrorism."
"I am pleased with the agreements reached on stem cell research: we have set clear limits respecting all sensitivities, the funding of human cloning, the cloning or creation of embryos for research and their destruction has been banned, at all times under the control of regional, national and international bodies."
"When I speak to patients and their families, I am moved by their capacity to embrace hope."
"They know that it may not be they who benefit from the solutions, but they feel obliged to defend that ray of hope for new patients; I certainly will not be taking that hope away from them."
"Research has always been a feature of European culture; the great European researcher, Steiner, said that."
"Creativity and research are aspects of our identity."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say how delighted I am that we are reaching a conclusion on this."
"Science is crucial to the competitiveness of the European Union."
"When you see the economic giants rising up in China and India and how many computer scientists are being produced in that part of the world, you know the challenge is on."
"The Commission acknowledged this in its initial presentation of the financing it sought for this programme."
"It must be said that the Council's response was very disappointing, not the first time under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Thank goodness the Brits were there to save the day and to increase the amount of money allocated to the science budget."
"It is crucial to acknowledge Mr Blair's role in that."
"However, we must also recognise that it is still not enough: EUR 50 billion is not enough for a seven-year programme for 27 countries."
"It is not a serious proposal."
"At the very least, Member States need to work together much more constructively in terms of building that capacity, because it is crucial."
"I refer to what Mr Turmes said earlier."
"Taking energy as an example, it is crucial to look at things like the technology platforms and the zero emissions platform."
"That is the kind of thing that will make a real difference to climate change."
"Unless we allocate that kind of money and emphasise that link between science, the state and private sector, we will have no hope of addressing these issues."
"Ideally, we would develop these things in the European Union in order to roll them out to areas like China and really make a big difference."
"Finally, on capacities, it is crucial that regions in the poorer areas of the Community catch up, meaning it is essential to develop the capacities aspect of this programme further."
"(FR) Mr President, research cannot be conducted without people, and that is why the research professions are becoming more and more important and why we support the creation of a genuine European research area."
"This should be accompanied by due recognition of researchers as a separate professional category, for we need researchers, we need to train good researchers, we need to keep our researchers and bring back those who have left Europe, and we even need to invite those from other countries who wish to join us."
"To this end, we must simplify the procedures for access to Marie Curie grants."
"We must encourage an approach to research that is more firmly based on the Lisbon objectives, especially by promoting links between universities and businesses."
"We must also examine the effectiveness of aid and the use of public funds and promote equality between men and women."
"Lastly, we must frame the protection of intellectual property rights, not only in respect of research findings but also as regards the intellectual property of each individual researcher."
"In conclusion, we expect the European Commission to convey to us the fullest possible information on the monitoring of this programme."
"(NL) Mr President, since the research programme is a key component of the Lisbon Strategy, it is to be welcomed that more funds are being made available."
"It is just unfortunate that they are not enough, not by a long shot."
"It is important that a great deal of money is being set aside for health and energy research, since there is a huge need for innovative research in those areas."
"Two billion has been kept back for energy, at least half of which is earmarked for sustainable energy and energy efficiency."
"There are promising ideas that merit further research in the pipeline, and it is important for the Member States to work together much more in this area."
"In the area of health, it is important to turn our attention to the neglected diseases and antibiotics resistance."
"Since we are marking World AIDS Day this week, now may be as good a time as any to opt for more funds for health research."
"It is also to be welcomed that 15% of the research funds are held in reserve for small and medium-sized enterprises. For this to happen, though, it is of course necessary for the red-tape to be cut drastically in the scheduling of the research programmes."
"To date, the involvement of SMEs has been limited because it was impossible for them to wade through all the paperwork."
"It is to be hoped that this can now change."
"Commissioner, I should like to finish off by drawing your attention to the following: research in fisheries is of huge importance in order to protect fish stocks and prevent overfishing."
"Unfortunately, the subject of fisheries has not been dealt with separately in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"What guarantees can you give that sufficient time and funds will be invested in this important research work?"
"(NL) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Seventh Framework Programme is indeed a milestone if we consider the budget and policy as a whole."
"As the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have noticed that, in terms of Capacities, we have succeeded in receiving additional budgets and additional scope for deploying the Structural Funds for research infrastructure at regional level."
"Thanks to Mr Buzek, Mr Prodi, Commissioner Hübner and the Committee on Regional Development, the budget has in this way been increased by many billions."
"This need not be done at European level, and together with the EIB's risk-sharing finance facility, considerable investments can be made."
"The roadmap for research and research infrastructure that was published recently is setting out the course for this."
"I can see evidence of these common investments, high-tech campuses and open innovation all over Europe."
"We must, in the face of cut-throat global competition, look for more focus, more substance and more connection between research and infrastructure."
"I am winding down."
"In that way, we can achieve the centres of excellence for nanotechnology, micro-electronics, health care, etc. It is not a 'brain drain' we advocate, but a 'brain gain'."
"(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Buzek for his report and on the proposed amendments to the Seventh Framework Programme, along with other MEPs for their work on the specific programmes, in particular the specific programme for direct actions conducted by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), where I am a shadow rapporteur."
"At a time when around 25% of all EU law relates to technical or scientific issues, the JRC has a vital role to play."
"As a part of the Commission, this institution is responsible for preparing the scientific background for legislative proposals."
"Consequently, it is vital to ensure that research is of a high quality and adequately funded."
"I also feel that the amendment to the rules for participation in the Seventh Framework Programme has proved successful in managing to simplify the rules in force, especially for university research."
"I hope that this process of breaking down administrative barriers will lead to the better exploitation of our potential for science and research in Europe."
"- (SL) I would like to mention the EURATOM programme."
"The European Union will also provide financial support for research in the fields of nuclear fission and radiation protection in the years to come."
"Its main innovation, however, is the considerably higher level of funding which it has made available for research activities in the field of nuclear fusion."
"The construction of the largest test nuclear fusion reactor in the world, which is not just a European project but also a global one, is expected to begin shortly."
"This programme is an ambitious one which meets the short, medium and long-term objectives of the European Union in the field of energy."
"I hope that Parliament will support the proposal put forward by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and reject the new draft amendments made at the plenary session."
"To summarise, we have come to an agreement that the efficiency of the financial administration should be improved and that regular reports on the implementation of the programme should be submitted to the European institutions."
"We have categorised nuclear energy as one of the vital resources for the reliability and sustainability of energy in Europe."
"We have emphasised the importance of ensuring adequate human resources and providing people with sufficient, accurate information about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy."
"I am satisfied with the contents, but not with the level of financial resources."
"At this point, I would like to thank everyone for their participation in the setting up of this programme."
"(SK) I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that from the very beginning the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has tried to adopt clear rules for participating in the 7th Framework Programme with as much transparency as possible."
"We have taken a similarly responsible approach in devising the simplest administrative procedures possible, with a view particularly to the small organisations that are participating in FP7."
"Most of the principles underpinning the rules of participation in Euratom are identical to the general rules applicable to the 7th Framework Programme."
"Given the time constraints, I am not going to dwell on the agreements already achieved."
"However, the Euratom implementation rules under the 7th Framework Programme have their own specific features, notably as regards research into controlled thermonuclear fusion."
"I appreciate the fact that in this Programme, too, we have been able to reach agreement, adopting several specific amendments that will be instrumental in implementing the ITER project more efficiently, as well as in funding a number of other initiatives that the European Fusion Development Agreement regards as priorities."
"(DE) Mr President, if I might say something brief in Mrs Morgan's direction, we would of course be delighted if Tony Blair were not only to fight but also to pay the bill."
"I believe, Commissioner, that this House has thrown a rock into your garden, and we now hope you will be able to do something with it."
"Quite apart from the Research Programme itself, we will also have to deal with the problem of having to weld it together with the CIP and with the financing instruments."
"We in this House have done something for which the Council had promised us additional financial aid; we have done it with money from the programme, and that was not an easy thing for us to do."
"We did it, though, because we think it right as part of an overall strategy."
"We have to say, bluntly, that we are now using money from the research programme to pay for the funding of innovation, and so we feel ourselves under an obligation."
"Parliament is still obliged to keep an eye on the risk sharing facility, in other words, we are not backing out; we will continue to support you, but - and I have to spell this out, since this was such a big thing for us to do - we will have to continue to maintain a watching brief on this matter."
"It is, then, a great success, but it is you who have the really big task of putting it all together."
"(HU) Mr President, one can only welcome the fact that the European Research Framework Programme has met its objectives and that the agreements have been concluded on schedule."
"I see significant guarantees that we will be able to retain and motivate our researchers."
"Several of our proposals were aimed at making participation easier and more transparent."
"Applying strict assessment procedures and ensuring that information is made widely accessible may broaden the circle of those who are able to take part in these European projects."
"I regret, however, that the Council and the Commission were rigid in refusing to guarantee that the non-refundable VAT would be accountable as a funded expense, although the Court of Auditors had supported our proposal and its rationale."
"However, the mechanism for optional flat-rate financing, which promises to be successful, will open up further opportunities to our universities and research institutes and will guarantee their broad, longer-term sustainable participation."
"The rules of participation have thus undergone positive change, and this means great satisfaction and good opportunities for the researchers of the new Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission, for increasing the budget by 63% over against what it was for the sixth programme is a momentous achievement, and shows that the Lisbon agenda, through which we focused, is right."
"It got the full support of this House and of the Council."
"We have now spent many years working to make improvements to it; the compromises we have arrived at are quite crucial in encouraging job creation and growth."
"Today, I am already thinking about the eighth programme."
"Having managed a 63% increase this time round, I hope we will achieve a comparable one in the eighth programme."
"What is much more important, though, is that the technical work has only just been completed, and now the real work is beginning."
"In 2009, we have elections to the European Parliament again, and there will be a new Commission; we still have time before then to sell our successes."
"I would ask you to get together with Commissioner Wallström and the President of the Commission to put together a design for how we can best get the message across to the interested parties for which we drafted this programme - in the universities, in factories, in every branch and sector - that what we have done with this programme we have done for the sake of Europe's future, and that new products and services will enable us to hold our own in global competition."
"Since we are spending over EUR 50 billion on product policy, I would ask that we should agree on a budget for marketing and public relations, so that the simplification that has been achieved - this mammoth task that we have accomplished for Europe - may also be got across to its people."
"Mr President, at this late hour, I wish to begin by thanking this House, on behalf of all the researchers in Europe, for your words of support during this three-hour debate."
"Many of you mentioned funding."
"Unfortunately, we have lost the bet, because the number seven would be really lucky - seven years, seventh programme, EUR 70 billion."
"In any case, we can still be proud of what we have achieved, because it is a serious increase."
"I have no doubt that the programme will be adopted tomorrow."
"Then we can continue with our work for the future."
"Firstly, on the question about fisheries, I would simply add that we now have theme No 2, named 'food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnology'."
"This was the last change that was made at the last debate, so it has been included."
"I should like to draw your attention to many important things that are part of our achievement."
"We will all have to consider in the future how the European Research Council is developing."
"It is a major thing for Europe."
"It is a major breakthrough that for the first time we are able to gain sources together at EU level, finding excellence without political interference, including mine. That is a major change in thinking, which I hope will be a source of future decisions connected with the European research area."
"We have European technology platforms which go far beyond the framework programme and they have much more potential."
"We talk about public-private partnerships in joint technology initiatives, which will be a delicate but worthwhile exercise in the future."
"We will also have to monitor these closely."
"We will have to deal with a risk-sharing finance facility, which you mentioned, and I am fully aware that you are expecting simplified procedures, which will not be easy to achieve."
"I am committed to doing that, but I sincerely hope that I will have the support of all those who can help."
"Unfortunately, I have learned that sometimes it is simply impossible to meet all expectations."
"If, on the one hand, you have private needs which seek fast solutions and, on the other hand, public money, you cannot come together 100%."
"We will do our best and we will try, but I just want to say that in some areas it is simply the logic of the work which does not fit 100%."
"We have a major success with the framework programme which we are putting on the table."
"However, the framework programme is only the foundation on which we have to build."
"We have to go beyond that."
"That is why I want to launch the debate on the European research area immediately."
"I have three major reasons for that."
"Firstly, the area was launched in the same year as the Lisbon Agenda."
"That may be a coincidence, but I do not think so, because the European research area is the main part of Lisbon thinking."
"Secondly, in 2009 we shall be embarking on a new Financial Perspective debate."
"It will be more than a new Financial Perspective debate, it will be a debate about how the future Europe should look."
"We should come into this debate with strong potential and only if we truly have a debate about European research area behind us will we be strong enough to show clearly that all the messages I have heard today are the right ones."
"Also, the others will understand them."
"Thirdly, when we talk about constitutional, institutional changes, we must be present at that debate."
"This debate will come alive soon and in this respect it is also important how the European research area and European research cooperation will be treated in future."
"Those are enough good reasons when we will be dealing with international cooperation, funding, infrastructure facilities and many questions which concern what we have done up to now and how we can improve in the future."
"When we talk about the famous 3% that we all have in mind, let us be clear that we have two major challenges."
"One challenge is coming from the developed countries."
"Here we are lagging behind in yearly funding for science and research."
"When we talk about the developing countries, it is not money that is the problem, but the pace, because they are making rapid progress."
"Those are the two challenges we have to face."
"When we talk about 3%, we have to be clear that its composition is twofold: public financing and private financing."
"In a way, since we can make decisions directly, it is easier to handle public financing."
"However, it is not always easy to come to the figures like in FP7 we were like to, but still it is in direct political control."
"But when we talk about private financing, which normally consists of two-thirds in normal circumstances, we do not have direct control."
"Here we can either go in through direct activities which are clearly linked to that, such as state aid, tax incentives, intellectual property rights, regulations, standardisation, lead market initiatives, public procurement, risk venture capital, and so on. However, if we are honest, then we have to take into account those things that are connected with competitiveness and the internal market."
"On higher education, if we do not make progress quickly, then higher education and universities in Europe are really the engine behind everything: the labour and financial markets and, finally, the coherence between macroeconomic policies and structural policies which have to be in place."
"So when we talk about our issues, these are the issues of all the governments, the whole Commission, the whole Parliament."
"We cannot settle them alone."
"That is why we always have to look at the big picture and why the debate on which we have to embark in the future is that one."
"We have to build on a positive climate which I think we have in Europe."
"We are now clearly devoting political attention to knowledge, research and development, but it is not important that we get it there, it is important that we keep it there."
"Why?"
"Because only if we have constant strategic attention for a period of some years can we truly count on serious changes in Europe."
"It is true that it is almost midnight but, if we work together, I am sure it is not too late."
"(Applause)"
"It is a rare occurrence, Commissioner, that so many Members are still in the chamber at midnight."
"That is indicative of the importance of this debate we have been holding for the best part of three hours."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The Seventh Framework Programme is not just another Framework Programme, as it has been designed in its content, organisation, implementation modes and management tools; as a key contribution to the re-launched Lisbon strategy by placing the emphasis on innovation and knowledge for growth and employment."
"By bringing and supporting new, innovative ideas through the FP7 via extended transnational cooperation, the aim is to effectively bring science and society closer together."
"One has to acknowledge that there is indeed genuine European added value in bringing universities, research centres and clusters, industry, SMEs and other legal entities together to cooperate and participate in research projects around defined priorities within a unique management framework on a multiannual basis."
"FP7 will of course have to be implemented in synergy with other Community policies such as the cohesion policy and the structural funds that, to a certain extent, also support research and development."
"With the implementation of FP7, there will be a genuine leverage effect on the objectives of other Community policies such as growth, employment and competitiveness."
"It will be ensured that knowledge, capacity and innovative technologies will be known, transferred, assimilated and used by businesses around the whole Union."
"I am a firm believer in the results science can bring us through non-embryonic stem cell research."
"It needs to be supported."
"We need to ensure results."
"Somatic stem cell therapies, which are those that use stem cells extracted from humans after they are born or from the umbilical cord and placenta, are at a tipping point."
"Advanced trials in human subjects are showing promising results."
"These advances are found in a wide range of conditions including heart and liver disease, diabetes, blindness caused by cornea damage, brittle bone disease, cystic fibrosis, strokes, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, among others."
"Therefore, it is my belief that it is in the best interest of the people we represent to ensure funding priority and stronger incentive be given to researchers capable of finding cures to diseases within the foreseeable future through the use of adult stem cells."
"Furthermore, it is my belief that there should be a periodic review of funding to research which may or may not bring about results."
"(FR) The Seventh Framework Research Programme is supposed to be designed as a tool at the service of an integral research policy that is simplified, is more accessible to SMEs and strengthens the links between research and industry in particular."
"It almost lives up to that aim."
"The fact is that concerns and questions remain, especially with regard to the participation of SMEs, where the access costs for participants and access to the risk-sharing finance facility still pose problems, with regard to coherence and the absence of confusion with other Community policies, with regard to the dissemination of knowledge, where quality and respect for intellectual property are issues, and with regard to the role of Member States in the governance of the programme."
"The seven-year duration of the programme also seems to be ill-suited to the pursuit of research goals, which are liable to change rapidly in spite of prescribed phases and evaluations."
"We also regret that research on embryonic stem cells has not been banned and that Parliament, like the Council and the Commission, has confined itself to mere definitions and restrictions in this domain."
"It remains no less true, however, that research, if it is the subject of a policy based on the pursuit of excellence, is one of the few areas in which the European Union can truly deliver better results than national activities could achieve."
"The placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Joel Hasse Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles - C6-0312/2005 -."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and my colleague Mr Verheugen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Ferreira as well as the Finnish Presidency."
"I am very happy to be able to represent my colleague on these issues since to a great extent it does affect consumer protection and safety."
"It is clear that this agreement would not have been possible without intensive efforts from both sides."
"It is very timely, coming as it does just before New Year's Eve, a time when the most fireworks are used in Member States."
"The directive will create an internal market and thus uniform and better framework conditions for pyrotechnic articles, which comprise fireworks but also airbags and seatbelt pretensioners."
"The directive is urgently awaited in particular by the automobile supply industry and by consumer protection organisations."
"It does not make sense for 27 Member States to prescribe different technical regulations for pyrotechnic articles, while their citizens within a Europe of open borders can easily shop for fireworks in neighbouring countries."
"The protection of consumers will therefore be decisively improved because pyrotechnic articles sold to consumers anywhere in the European Union must in future fulfil the essential safety requirements of the directive and will be subject to conformity assessment."
"Moreover, for campaigns which market the products in several Member States, the uniform standards will contribute to a substantial reduction of the bureaucratic burden."
"The Commission is well aware that the use of fireworks is subject to different traditions and customs in the Member States."
"Therefore we can agree to the amendment proposed by Parliament that certain fireworks do not fall under the directive if they are produced by manufacturers for their own use and if their use by the manufacturer himself has been approved by the respective Member State."
"For the same reason, it was also necessary to grant to the Member States the possibility of taking national measures regarding certain categories of pyrotechnic articles."
"This concerns in particular fireworks in categories 2 and 3, which can pose somewhat higher risks."
"Therefore, the use of bangers and flash bangers by the general public will remain forbidden in many Member States in future."
"Consequently, such fireworks will be excluded completely from category 1, for which the Member States cannot lay down further restrictions."
"This exclusion is specified in essential safety requirements and will be taken up in a mandate which the Commission will give to the European Standardisation Committee after the adoption of the directive."
"The Commission confirmed this by making a declaration during the negotiations with the Council and Parliament."
"I am also pleased that an agreement has been achieved with the Council regarding the labelling of pyrotechnic articles, where a balanced solution between high safety requirements on the one hand, and avoidance of complicated and burdensome requirements on manufacturers on the other, has been found."
"In conclusion I would like to point out that, once again, the negotiation process has benefited very much from the close collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The Commission can therefore agree to all compromise amendments and I am confident that we can achieve the adoption of this directive at first reading."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the pyrotechnic market as a whole is far larger than just the fireworks segment."
"The major part of the market corresponds to car safety equipment, such as airbags and seatbelts."
"Fireworks represent 20% of the market, although they have given rise to most of the proposed amendments to the report that I have tabled."
"Marine equipment not covered by international conventions has also been incorporated within this directive."
"Furthermore, a category of pyrotechnic articles for theatrical use has been created, and pyrotechnic articles in the aircraft and aerospace industry have been excluded, because of all the control systems already in place."
"The market value of pyrotechnic articles used in the car industry is some EUR 5.5 billion, whereas that of fireworks is about EUR 1.4 billion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with the approval of this Directive, we shall be making a significant contribution to the free movement of pyrotechnic products within the European Union."
"We shall also be ensuring greater safety for consumers and professional users."
"The harmonisation of safety rules among the Member States in the various market segments included here will lead to greater consumer confidence and freer movement of the products."
"The possibility of having different rules at national level has, in any case, been retained, particularly in relation to minimum ages for handling certain categories of fireworks."
"We have also taken into account the specific situations in Malta and certain regions of Italy regarding the use of fireworks by the people who make them at certain religious and cultural events."
"In view of the volume of pyrotechnic products imported into Europe, especially from China, we have also decided to attribute clear responsibilities to importers and distributors of pyrotechnic articles; this is especially important in the case of fireworks."
"We have also devoted considerable attention to the labelling issue and to noise aspects."
"In the vehicle sector, we have been careful to take account of the international dimension of the European vehicle component industry."
"The deadlines for transposing the Directive have been extended in order to allow more time for suitable, harmonised standards to be created or updated, as appropriate."
"Mr President, it is also worth highlighting the agreement reached with the European Council, despite the technical difficulties raised by the original text of the Proposal for a Directive, and despite the significant cultural differences that exist between several Member States, particularly regarding the sale and use of fireworks."
"Before I finish, ladies and gentlemen, it is only right that I should thank Mr Oivukkamäki for the part he played in this process on behalf of the Finnish Presidency, and Mr Schmahl, who represented the Commission in this process."
"In addition, we must not forget the work and the follow-up done by Mrs Weisgerber, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and Mr Brie, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"As Chairman, Mrs McCarthy played a decisive role throughout the process, especially at the trialogue stage."
"In addition, we must not forget Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the draftsman for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Mr Muscat, for his interest throughout this process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this context I call on you to vote for the set of compromises negotiated with the various parliamentary groups, as well as with the Council and the Commission, so that we can approve this directive at first reading."
"By doing so, we shall be ensuring better protection for consumers and enhancing competitiveness in the economic sectors covered by this Directive."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude to the rapporteur for his constructive cooperation."
"We have achieved a great success; the directive on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles can be adopted tomorrow at first reading, and we have indeed already reached agreement with the Council."
"This directive draws together the 25 different sets of legislation governing explosives within the European Union."
"This means that we have done away with another little bit of bureaucracy."
"Through this directive, we will be a large step closer to realising the internal market for the trade in fireworks, airbags and other pyrotechnic products."
"There will no longer be a need for special products to be manufactured for each Member State, which will give rise to enormous cost savings."
"The industry can now focus on meeting uniform requirements across Europe."
"I have been calling, in particular, for a simplified procedure for those who use fireworks professionally."
"The aim of this simplified procedure is for the manufacturers or importers of fireworks for professional use to implement their own quality assurance systems."
"The manufacturers or importers will, however, continue to be subject to regular monitoring by competent authorities."
"In this way, we have given more responsibility in this area back to the businesses, thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy."
"We were able to introduce specific regulations for the field of automotive engineering, which includes airbags and seatbelt pretensioners."
"This area, in particular, requires high safety standards without overlaying these with requirements for the labelling of airbags that are built into vehicles anyway."
"It is, in particular, the consumers, and I would like to emphasise this point, who will benefit from the new directive, as it affords them improved levels of safety."
"There have been a handful of very serious accidents with fireworks due to the differing safety requirements of the Member States."
"A procedure is now being introduced according to which safety requirements will be just as high in every Member State."
"Tomorrow, through the vote on the fireworks directive, we will realise the internal market in this area, whilst at the same time providing greater safety levels for consumers."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I must explain that I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Fourtou, who has been dealing with this matter for our group but has been prevented from attending by other commitments."
"Mrs Fourtou wishes to express her special thanks to Mr Hasse Ferreira for his work as well as to her honourable colleagues from the other political groups."
"She found it agreeable to work in an atmosphere where everyone was prepared to listen and to operate in complete transparency."
"She took part in the various trialogues and fully supports the rapporteur's approach."
"She regrets, however, that a Council amendment removes the obligation on Member States to draw up correlation tables."
"In fact, since the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement in 2003, the three institutions have been committed to better legislation and have acknowledged the importance of these tables."
"The Council, apparently, no longer wishes to honour that commitment."
"Be that as it may, Mrs Fourtou thanks the rapporteur and the Finnish Presidency and notes that both of them tried to defend the correlation tables."
"Not wishing to block the procedure, she persuaded our group to vote in favour of the compromise amendments and of the report."
"Mr President, as coordinator for my group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I particularly wanted to come here this evening to pay tribute to the team that has worked on this, Mr Hasse Ferreira, who has led this with distinction, and particularly my colleague, Mrs Weisgerber, who has worked tirelessly together with Mr Hasse Ferreira on this proposal."
"From the point of view of the internal market, this is an excellent example of how Parliament can significantly improve a highly technical text."
"This may seem an abstruse and perhaps rather marginal sector, but as both the rapporteurs have pointed out this evening, we are talking about a total product range here: there is EUR 5.5 billion in automotive pyrotechnics and EUR 1.5 billion in fireworks."
"That is a very substantial market and their achievement has been extremely important, firstly in creating the internal market; secondly by improving standards for consumers and product-labelling, raising the whole standard of quality in the marketplace; and thirdly in improving the procedures."
"It is an indication of the fact that if Parliament gets its act together and works in detail on technical improvements, it really can make a significant step forward, both for consumers and for the European economy."
"I thank all my colleagues concerned for making that possible."
"Mr President, I should just like to thank the rapporteur and the Members once again for their excellent work, and to say that we are looking forward to a first-reading agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today - since it is after midnight - at 11 a.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(MT) By means of the Pyrotechnics Directive, we are enhancing the health and safety both of consumers and of those who are engaged in this type of work."
"By means of this directive, as amended by this report, there will be greater safety, especially with regard to the market for pyrotechnic products sold in retail outlets and used directly by consumers all over Europe."
"At the same time, the amendments unanimously agreed on in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection acknowledge that there is a market for fireworks that are not sold directly to consumers but that are manufactured for use in licensed activities covered by insurance."
"These activities include the traditional festivals held mostly in the Mediterranean, including Malta."
"The amendments agreed on do not involve safety regulations, but simply demand that there should be no excessive bureaucracy in these cases."
"The original procedures would not have led to any changes in the way work is carried out, but would have brought about an increase in costs."
"In Malta's case, these would have been borne by the voluntary bodies that organise these festivals."
"These amendments were designed and agreed on with the responsible authorities, including the Maltese Standards Authority."
"It should also be made clear that, where the setting off of fireworks is concerned, regulations governing distances and timing are drawn up by each individual country and have never been included in this directive."
"Rights of patients in the EU (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the rights of patients in the European Union."
"Mr President, the issue of high-quality health services is of great importance to all European citizens."
"Moreover, the right to healthcare is a fundamental right recognised by the EU Charter."
"Nevertheless, health services are primarily national in nature."
"There is, however, broad consensus that there is a clear added value in cooperation on health services at European level."
"Together with the Member States, the Commission has been conducting a mapping exercise on common principles and elements of healthcare in the European Union."
"Special attention was paid to patients' rights."
"According to our preliminary results, there are indeed common elements of patients' rights shared by EU health systems."
"These include providing timely and appropriate healthcare, sufficient information to patients about different treatment options, respecting confidentiality of health data and compensation for harm from negligence in healthcare."
"However, the mechanisms in place across the Member States to implement these principles vary widely in practice."
"They range from patients' rights laws to non-binding patient charters, legal obligations for health professionals, patient ombudsmen, etc. Moreover, those mechanisms do not sufficiently take into account the situation of patients to or from other Member States."
"This is a particular area where Community on health services could help to improve the situation."
"As Parliament is aware, we have recently launched a public consultation regarding Community action on health services."
"This public consultation explicitly addresses issues directly linked to patients' rights."
"Depending on the outcome of the consultation, issues relating to patients' rights could be addressed through proposals for Community action in 2007, whilst of course respecting subsidiarity."
"Whether this would be a legislative proposal or rather take the form of a charter on patients' rights will depend, as I have said, on the results of the consultation."
"I look forward to listening to the views of Members in today's debate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Commissioner will not have long to listen to us, but very briefly, there are three rights: the right to treatment, the right to humane and effective treatment, and the right to be involved in decisions affecting one's treatment."
"I look forward to seeing the Commissioner's proposals being brought forward very soon, in particular where mental health is concerned."
"With regard to the right to safe treatment and care, the fact that 10% of hospitalisations result in medical error; the fact that we have hospital bugs such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile; the fact that we have too many needlestick injuries: these are all areas involving patient safety."
"That is a right that patients should have."
"As regards the right to safe patient mobility, the Commissioner has said that he is bringing forward proposals in that area which we look forward to receiving."
"Among the rights that he will include in that, I am sure, will be the rights to have proper checks on health professionals and on the facilities, hospitals and clinics to which people may be going."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Justice is being asked more and more frequently to rule on matters concerning the rights of patients who receive treatment in Member States other than their own, and the resulting case law could take the place of the democratic decisions that our institutions should be taking on this matter."
"For this reason, I welcome the Commissioner's initiative."
"My fear, however, is that the rights established through the proposals you are able to make to us will not become effective in practice for want of adequate frameworks in the Member States."
"I am therefore going to ask you a few questions."
"How do you intend to realise in practice the universal right to health care to which you referred and equality of access within the European Union, given the well-known gulfs between the health levels and between the health-care structures in individual Member States?"
"We recently reviewed the breast-cancer situation and regrettably reached the collective conclusion that the recommendations made by the European Union on prevention had not been acted upon in some Member States, to the detriment of the patients concerned."
"As far as obesity is concerned, you indicated yourself a few days ago that, if self-regulation did not work, the European Union would take legislative action."
"There are also proposals from Members of this House on the question of mental health and on the possibility of legislation in that area."
"Do you not think that the European Union should take the lead today on health matters?"
"It must show greater ambition and, in particular, raise the general quality of health systems, though not neglecting, of course, the parallel issues, for we are well aware of the adverse effects that poor living conditions can have on people's health."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we are truly delighted that this important debate is taking place so promptly after a question on patients' rights was tabled by several ALDE Group members, which was in fact initiated by Dr Parvanova, a Bulgarian Observer colleague."
"We are also very grateful to Commissioner Kyprianou for the genuine interest and concern he has shown in speedily and efficiently dealing with the question on patients' rights in the EU."
"With regard to the Commission statement which is the subject of this debate, we take the view that it should cover areas like recognition that comparable standards of healthcare and a common set of patients' rights should be discussed at EU level in order to have the added value of the internal market on healthcare issues, and in order to empower patients to fully recognise and exercise their rights."
"Furthermore, we have always believed that in the discussions on patients' rights in Europe, the Commission should take into account previous work done by civil society organisations in respect of drafting the European Charter of Patients' Rights."
"(SK) I would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue."
"In the European Union the very notion of 'patients' rights' is purely theoretical, as there is considerable legal uncertainty in this area."
"With regard to transborder healthcare provision, patients' rights have been shaped exclusively by the rulings of the European Court of Justice, and that only since 1998, when the ECJ ruled in the Kohll vs. Decker case."
"We cannot expect the public to be familiar with the fact that on 16 May 2006 the Court of Justice ruled in the case of Yvonne Watts, clearly stating that where waiting times are exceedingly long and the patient's life is at risk, the patient has the right to receive treatment abroad and to have treatment-related costs reimbursed in the home country."
"The average citizen is often unaware of such rulings."
"We need legislation which is binding on the Member States, and which will communicate to patients all they need to know about how to find a medical specialist abroad, as well as details of healthcare reimbursement procedures."
"We can derive some hope from the health services directive referred to in the Commission's communication, although it is still premature to talk about when this directive might be adopted."
"I would like to point out that members of the public may submit comments on this communication up until 31 January 2007."
"At the same time, the quality of healthcare and the availability of up-to-the-minute techniques and theories vary among the Member States."
"We must offer patients the opportunity to choose where they want to be treated, as unduly long waiting lists may keep people waiting until they die."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this debate and to thank Mrs Parvanova, without whose question this debate would not have been possible."
"Commissioner, you have instituted a public consultation process on the issues surrounding patient mobility."
"That is the perfect way to clear up questions such as: what gaps in the legislation are there in an internal market for health services that is, in fact, not a real internal market at all?"
"What access do patients have to information, and not just information in relation to their rights, but also in relation to their medication?"
"At present, information of this nature is restricted in Europe, as we all know, and represents a fundamental obstacle to good health. What arrangements would health tourism bring about when correctly implemented, and what aid opportunities and productivity would it bring the European Union?"
"We should think of Europe as a single health area. That should be our vision."
"Perhaps the public consultation process could be the first step in the right direction."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the House for the debate."
"We have the opportunity to exchange views on different occasions, and this is a very important issue."
"I will be able to offer more specific replies after the end of the consultation process which, as I have already mentioned, is taking place now."
"However, all the issues mentioned by Mr Bowis and other colleagues - the right to treatment, patient safety, patient mobility - are not only part of this consultation process but also in different initiatives as well."
"As you know, we have these on patient safety for example or to deal with inequalities."
"Part of the debate in this consultation process will also deal with the issue of quality and standards and whether we should introduce European Union level standards on healthcare."
"Those are part of the questions that we will be discussing."
"This is also linked to the serious problem of inequalities that exist on health, not just between Member States, but even within Member States."
"To a certain extent, patient mobility can address some of these problems, but this is not always the solution."
"The target should always be to raise as much as possible the level and the standard in the Member States."
"Whatever we discuss we should always bear in mind that patients would rather be treated at home where their families and friends are and where they speak the language."
"As to the tools, I believe we will be using all possible and available instruments."
"It is a complex issue that will require a comprehensive approach and there will be a package of measures, some of which will be legislation - when it comes to creating and offering legal certainty we need to resort to legislation."
"As I have said, it is a big and complicated issue that will require a step-by-step approach, but I am optimistic enough to hope that we will be able to present the first proposal before the end of next year."
"That will be just the first step. Others will follow."
"Finally, an important aspect of this process will be to create informed and empowered patients - informed as to treatment, medicine, the possibilities of cross-border healthcare and how to choose a physician."
"All these are important aspects, otherwise, all the other rights, unless we have an informed patient, will not be taken advantage of and will not be of benefit to the patient."
"This is also an important part of our initiative and effort."
"As I have said, we are now in the middle of the consultation process."
"Today we have had our first ministerial reflection process specifically on this issue."
"We will continue the consultation process until the end of January and after that we will be able to discuss it in more detail with Parliament as well."
"I am also looking forward to receiving Parliament's views on this issue in the consultation process."
"I consider this to be just the beginning of the debate and I expect to be able to go into more detail next year."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(NL) Where patient rights within Europe are concerned, this House must try to retain, and strengthen, its leading role."
"Much progress remains to be made, though, in the area of information for patients."
"The European citizen has the right to be better informed; after all, the right to information for the patient is enshrined in the European Charter for hospital patient rights."
"Patients should be better informed about possible medicines and other treatments."
"Why should doctors have a monopoly on this information?"
"What the Liberals want to see is more information provided to the consumers, if I may call them that, and there have been major developments on the medicines front over recent years."
"Patients' attitudes have undergone radical change."
"More and more of them believe they are entitled to more information, and more and more of them actively look for information about the treatment of their disorder."
"Patients want to shoulder some of the responsibility for their own treatment."
"In many cases, they seek contact with other patients suffering from the same illness in order to exchange information."
"When citizens are fully informed, they probably make other choices, which is something they have every right to do."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"

"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.00 a.m.)"
"Documents received: see Minutes"

"AIDS"
"The next item is the Commission Statement on AIDS."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years considerable progress has been made, broadly speaking, in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including better access to effective treatment and to prevention programmes."
"Nevertheless, the number of people infected with HIV or dying of AIDS continues to grow."
"By the end of 2006, almost 40 million people will have been infected with HIV, 2.6 million more than at the end of 2004."
"It is estimated that in 2006 4.3 million people, both adults and children, have been newly infected with HIV, which is 400 000 more than two years ago."
"Sub-Saharan Africa remains at the forefront of this epidemic."
"More than 63% of all adults infected with HIV now live in Sub-Saharan African countries, and 33% in South Africa."
"The biggest increase in the past two years has been observed in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the number of people infected with HIV has risen by 21%."
"The continuing growth in the number of newly diagnosed infections in most EU Member States, together with the results of Eurobarometer surveys from 2005, indicate that levels of awareness on epidemics in the EU and in neighbouring countries must be raised as a matter of urgency and that prevention programmes in this field must be strengthened."
"The strategy set up by the Commission in 2005 was centred around the priority of strengthening prevention, treatment and care in certain regions."
"Despite these disturbing figures, there has been a reduction in the incidence of AIDS in some African and Caribbean countries and in some regions of southern Asia."
"It is possible to reverse the trend."
"There are more women around the world infected with HIV than ever before."
"In 2006, the number of infected women has reached 17.7 million, a million cases more than in the last two years."
"The situation in Sub-Saharan African countries is worse still."
"Women account for 60% of adults of 15 years and above infected with HIV."
"In addition to biological factors, and the fact that women and girls are much more susceptible to becoming infected with HIV, social and economic factors arising from gender inequality and the neglect of their rights also play a part."
"Equal rights for women is a key social challenge and an essential prerequisite for even-handed development and increased HIV prevention."
"In order that girls and women around the world can gain access to sexual and reproductive health, health services in developing countries must be strengthened so as to establish voluntary counselling, medical examinations, healthcare and support, as part of an all-round package."
"Access to medicines and healthcare has improved considerably in recent years, although in most countries it was starting from a very low base."
"Thanks to the increased provision of antiretroviral treatment, some 2 million lives have been saved in almost four years and even in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, some 8 000 people have received treatment."
"Nevertheless, despite this welcome progress, the situation gives cause for concern, and the international community needs to devote more attention to it."
"The Commission is setting up intensive assistance, for partner countries in Africa and elsewhere, geared towards combating epidemics by means of integrating prevention, treatment and care."
"HIV/AIDS cannot be viewed as an isolated problem because it highlights all of the major problems facing developing countries, namely restricted access to basic social services, gender inequality, unequal distribution of resources, ineffective public administration and low levels of economic and technological development."
"HIV/AIDS is closely linked with malaria and tuberculosis, which are also poverty-related infectious diseases."
"HIV/AIDS can only be combated successfully if the partner countries fight against it in the context of efforts to reduce poverty."
"The main principle underpinning the European political framework adopted in 2004, and the European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis adopted the following year, is an integrated approach to HIV."
"The European Programme for Action must be implemented and coordinated by the Commission, both at State and at worldwide level."
"It is indeed the partner countries that are in the best position to decide the most effective way of distributing resources effectively, fairly and transparently among the various initiatives."
"Over the course of the years, the Commission has continually increased its resources in the fight against HIV/AIDS in all developing countries, especially in Africa, where it is providing assistance to partner countries via budgetary support in their efforts to address the structural factors underlying the HIV epidemic, such as healthcare reforms and the crisis in the area of human resources in the heath sector."
"Among other initiatives, the Commission has also invested a considerable amount of money, EUR 522 million over five years, in the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries from the global fund for the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"During 2006, the Commission's role in the global fund was fully confirmed by the fact that the board elected a Member of the European Commission to the post of Vice-President of the fund."
"The Commission has traditionally taken the lead in efforts to improve access to antiretroviral drugs in developing countries and to ensuring the full availability of treatment and access to prevention for those who need them by 2010, and has played a central role in reducing the cost of pharmaceutical products."
"In some cases, there has been a reduction of up to 98%, which has been achieved by means of introducing a price varying mechanism that enables developing countries to pay less for patented medicines while protecting manufacturers from the re-import of these products into open markets where profits can be made."
"Also in the framework of the WTO, the Commission is helping the poorest countries, whose production capacity is limited, to exercise their rights to import cheap generic medicines produced with compulsory licences."
"The Commission has also increased investment in the research and development of vaccines and other means of prevention, such as microbicides, with a view to broadening the existing range of HIV prevention mechanisms."
"The Commission will continue with these efforts to make prevention and treatment fully available to all those who need it by 2010."
"As previous speakers have mentioned, the Commission has, in conjunction with the Member States, undertaken to fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic by means of a range of measures aimed at prevention, treatment, support and care."
"We are fully aware that the ultimate goal of a generation without AIDS is unattainable without firm political commitment, informed leadership and increased resources at global, national and local levels."
"We face a huge challenge: making further progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and ensuring that prevention and treatment will be fully available to all those who need them by 2010."
"We urgently need a more balanced strategy aimed at increasing prevention and treatment and ensuring access to affordable treatment, in particular as regards patented second-tier medicines."
"We must therefore mobilise the political will for this in Europe."
"We must work more closely with the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on developing new methods of prevention, in particular microbicides, which will provide better prevention for women and will ensure that new medicines are more affordable."
"The pharmaceutical industry must be encouraged to carry out research and to develop vaccines and other products to combat HIV/AIDS."
"Lastly, we must make sure that the partner countries receive long-term reliable funding to support them in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic."
"In this connection, the Commission will continue to work, on a broader scale, with the help of the financial instruments at both national and global levels, including the global fund for the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
"We need strong support and cooperation from all of the EU institutions, however, including Parliament, as they are responsible for the annual allocation of financial resources."
"In the fight against HIV/AIDS, we have the opportunity to achieve better results, but this requires political will."
"The Commission firmly believes that the ultimate aims, namely a generation without AIDS and making treatment and care available to all those who need it, are attainable."
"I look forward to working with Parliament to achieve those aims."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - As we again approach World AIDS Day, we commemorate, we remember friends and we resolve to do more."
"We are now commemorating 25 years of AIDS."
"We remember the 25 million fellow citizens who have died from AIDS and we think of the 40 million living with AIDS."
"Many of them live in Europe and many in neighbouring countries to the east, such as Russia, Kaliningrad and Central Asia, but two-thirds live in sub-Saharan Africa."
"We in the north have promised our support."
"We have earmarked money for this and then, all too often, lost it again."
"Science advances, but we have not yet delivered."
"Only 5% of HIV-positive children receive medical help."
"Fewer than 10% of the 15 million AIDS orphans receive financial support."
"Every year we have a resolution."
"A resolution is two things: a form of words and good intentions, or a determination to achieve those ends."
"We need to invest in research and trials for the development of AIDS vaccines."
"We need to invest in service delivery and education for drugs and therapies, in mothers and children, in preventative campaigns, in health and care professionals and in NGO support teams."
"We need to pull out all the stops to meet the UN target of universal access to services, to treatment and to care by 2010, as the Commissioner said."
"The year 2010 is not far away, but we are."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, our funding for HIV/AIDS prevention is still running well below target, falling behind by something like USD 12 billion."
"Therefore, as the Commissioner said, there is an urgent need for more public and private funding in order to address the shortcomings."
"There is no single panacea for HIV eradication, but there has to be more education and more funding for vaccine research and for microbicides, which the Commissioner mentioned."
"The development of a vaginal microbicide has to be our immediate priority, and it is predicted that it could be developed and used within five years."
"It is the only way for women to have real control over their own sexual health."
"It is a method that does not require the consent of a partner."
"In addition, AIDS treatments in the developing world will not, and cannot, be sustainable unless there is a supply of the newer versions of generic medicines, which are increasingly needed as drugs-resistant cases of HIV/AIDS become more frequent."
"That means we have to be much more audacious in the way we confront the patents that pharmaceutical companies continue to hide behind, making the price of treatment impossible to meet in many developing countries and under the kind of health systems my colleague, Mr Bowis, mentioned."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mr Špidla, I am pleased that the Commission has devoted the first section of this communication to the need to involve civil society in all aspects of combating this epidemic."
"This complies with the requirement put forward in the Dublin and Vilnius declarations."
"Information and the appropriate services which are provided by easily accessed support centres managed by non-governmental organisations to risk groups in society affected by HIV can significantly slow down the spread of AIDS in a country."
"As rapporteur, I am troubled by the fact that in several new Member States the continued existence of such a support centre is currently directly under threat as a result of a lack of financial resources."
"It turns out that, prior to accession to the European Union, these centres received multilateral financial support from various existing funds and organisations, including some outside Europe, which now, following the countries' accession to the European Union, consider their charitable missions to be at an end."
"Despite the undertaking of the Minister of Health, expressed in the Vilnius declaration, to use national financial instruments as well as EU funds, including Structural Funds, in the struggle against AIDS, in practice this is not happening in several Member States."
"In relation to the Structural Funds, the leaders of civil-society organisations point to the impossibility of obtaining cofinancing."
"I think that both the Member States and the European Commission need to resolve this issue urgently."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that, in spite of the as yet minimal progress made when it comes to access to treatment, the disease is, unfortunately, not on the decline."
"On the contrary: in our own countries, in particular, the epidemic has, rather, gained ground."
"We are therefore delighted about the consensus taking shape in this House concerning the need definitely to review the TRIPS agreement on access to medicines, since the arrangements provided for within the framework of the Doha round do not, unfortunately, at present permit real access to inexpensive medicines."
"That being said, the problem of AIDS is not only a problem of funding and of access to medicines."
"It might even be said that the emphasis placed on access to medicines has no doubt eclipsed the need to go on ceaselessly promoting prevention, which is now in decline both in our own countries and everywhere else."
"It is therefore essential to resume the prevention and information campaigns via the media, enlisting the help of qualified personnel, as well as on the social and medical networks, with a view to raising people's awareness."
"Secondly - and this is something that you have pointed out and something that is no doubt the most difficult thing to achieve - we also need, if we are really to change the situation, to alter cultural practices when it comes to sexuality and, in particular, to protect women and enable women to protect themselves."
"Women now constitute 50% of patients, which was not the case at the beginning of the epidemic."
"They are also affected in an extremely brutal and violent way not only by cruel treatment and other practices that take place in time of war in conflict zones but also by rape, prostitution, trafficking in women and female sexual slavery - all scourges that help facilitate the growth of the epidemic."
"Consequently, the way in which the European Union promotes women's rights and equality also constitutes a very effective way of combating the epidemic and focusing on the transmission of the disease from mother to child - a mode of transmission that is rarely mentioned at present."
"Innovative solutions do exist in some countries - for example, Malawi - where, by proceeding on the basis of decentralisation so as to get closer to the people and by also arranging for an active role to be played by the patients themselves - those whose condition has been stabilised - extremely positive results are achieved."
"This even applies in extremely poverty-stricken countries."
"We must therefore make much further progress on all these levels."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner's speech sounds frankly rhetorical: it is full of fine statements, which are not matched by an equally positive role on the part of the European Commission."
"As the latest data from UNAIDS demonstrate, the number of HIV infections is continuing to grow and, in some countries, we are even seeing a fresh outbreak of the virus."
"Faced with all of this, patented drugs continue to be unaffordable, and the TRIPS agreements are creating an insurmountable obstacle to access to medicines, condemning almost three million people to death each year."
"The ones taking advantage of this situation are the multinational pharmaceutical companies, which recorded a 24% increase in their profits in 2005; these multinationals are protected by the US Administration, which has never stopped using its political and commercial weight to influence the negotiations on pharmaceutical patents."
"At multilateral level, the Bush administration's agenda is aimed at making the safeguard clauses laid down by the TRIPS agreements unenforceable, clauses which, in the event of a health crisis, would allow the member countries to bypass intellectual property rights and to have access to lifesaving drugs."
"However, while the United States can be rightly accused of attacking one of the most basic human rights, that of health care, Europe certainly cannot consider itself blameless."
"The inertia shown by the Commission and the Member States when it comes to equipping themselves with a Community regulation that is genuinely able to implement the Doha Declaration must be well and truly condemned."
"Commissioner, you said that a few thousand Africans were receiving treatment, but, in Africa, 30 million people are HIV-positive, 6.5 million of whom require treatment."
"Tomorrow is World AIDS Day: global civil society is asking once and for all for politics to shoulder its responsibilities, which concern not only the issue of access to medicines but also the funding allocated to prevention and research programmes."
"The creation of an international market in generic medicines, supported by a new system of medical research geared towards people's real needs, remains the crucial issue."
"For this reason, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that it is crucial for the resolution on which the House will vote to commit the Commission and the Council to: 1) acknowledge the failure of the decision of 30 August 2003; 2) propose within the WTO to amend the TRIPS agreements and the new procedures for granting compulsory licences, which must be able to respond swiftly to health emergencies caused by the HIV epidemic; 3) allocate EUR 1 billion to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as was already requested by Parliament on 2 December 2004 and ignored by the Commission and the Council; 4) dedicate more resources to research into medicines designed to treat diseases specifically affecting the south of the world and oblige the private sector, which has always benefited from public research, to set aside a reasonable amount of its own research for these neglected diseases."
"Too much time and energy has been wasted on making false promises; it is now time to act!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard many fine words and statements from the Commission, and a fair amount of demagogy from various Members."
"We are confronted here with actions that are not outlined in the Commission document, but that are nonetheless necessary."
"The fact is, we must take a decisive stand in fighting the spread of drug use, which means zero tolerance, help and rehabilitation for those who are, to all intents and purposes, sick and should be treated as such."
"We should not praise sexual promiscuity, which the mass media and opinion leaders today regard and portray as the path to follow."
"We need a policy that educates people but that also discourages high-risk behaviour, and a policy of informed parenthood for those affected."
"We also need to launch a serious fight against prostitution, which we are very far from doing in our Europe, and we certainly also need to do more in terms of monitoring, testing and, of course, treating and preventing infectious diseases, as described in the document."
"We are not on the right track, however, Mr President, when I still hear my fellow Members and when I read speeches preaching 'freedom', freedom that, for society, means inertia and, for civilisation, in this case, means regression."
"(PL) Like malaria and other diseases, the current situation regarding AIDS presents a wide range of challenges involving education, prevention, research, care and treatments."
"Firstly, proper sexual health education is needed, especially in poor countries."
"The issue is promiscuity arising due to social and economic circumstances, which I learned about, for example, on sugar cane plantations in the Dominican Republic."
"Economic conditions need to be improved, and social values and rules changed."
"This would create the right circumstances for positive changes in sexual behaviour and there would then be an end to morally controversial procedures on human foetuses."
"Secondly, scientific research may be expensive and often a financial risk, but it must be carried out: both vaccines and treatment against the viruses need to be found."
"For this reason international research groups must be supported."
"Thirdly, society needs to care for those afflicted by the virus, and especially for AIDS orphans whose unfortunate situation is the result of other peoples' sexual behaviour."
"Fourthly, only a minute percentage of the 40 million individuals infected with the HIV virus currently has access to medication and medical aid."
"This is where we have the most opportunities to act."
"Medication can be made available to many more carriers if suitable policies are put in place."
"(NL) Mr President, the World Fund is already the biggest fund in the worldwide fight against the diseases in question, and I take pride in the fact that the EU accounts for 65% of the contributions to it."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has made out a case for the World Fund and has committed to it, which is enormously laudable."
"Europe has a responsibility in respect of the rest of the world, and this Fund fleshes out this responsibility."
"Let me let you in on a big scandal, though."
"Next year, it looks like Mr Barroso will be unable to deliver on his promise to the World Fund."
"It appears that the money from the European Development Fund that was earmarked for the World Fund in 2007 has already been spent on other things."
"The Commission wants to plug this hole by extracting funds from the general development budget, which means removing funds from the budget for education, gender equality, the fight against poverty and hunger and the fight against child labour."
"Surely, Mr President, this cannot be justified to all those people who rely on our support and on the undertakings we have given."
"How can the Commission ask us to choose between the fight against deadly diseases and all other things we stand for, which we have made provision for in the budget, on the one hand and the contributions to achieving the Millennium Objectives on the other?"
"In matters of life and death, it should not be a case of having to make choices."
"If you manage to set aside 1 billion for infrastructure and 3 billion for good governance from the European Development Fund for the next few years, then you may be able to scrape together 100 million annually for the World Health Fund."
"Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, should free up this 100 million, not at the expense of education, child labour or care for women, but from the European Development Fund."
"Maybe we should allocate a little less for infrastructure and these other items."
"If you get your priorities right, you are on the right track; if not, you have neglected to do any sound forward planning and have, as a result, caused quite a bit of damage."
"I would call on the Commission to have another close look at this."
"The availability of antiretroviral therapy does not just bring hope to AIDS sufferers themselves."
"It also transforms attitudes to AIDS in the wider population."
"The knowledge that effective treatment is available is a key factor in encouraging people to be tested for HIV."
"The more people are aware of their HIV status, the easier it is to control the spread of the disease."
"That is why it is particularly worrying that the price of new, improved and second-line AIDS medicines remains prohibitively high."
"It is good news that the price of some established first-line AIDS drugs has come right down, but figures from South Africa and Malawi indicate that up to one in six patients will need to switch to newer drug combinations within three to five years."
"What can the Commission do to persuade pharmaceutical companies to register their newer drugs in developing countries and make those newer drugs available at affordable prices?"
"Failing that, we will soon be back to square one."
"The drugs that still work will be unaffordable and donors, including the EU, will effectively be donating to the pharmaceutical industry."
"(ES) Mr President, we are still a long way from winning the fight against HIV-AIDS; all we need is political will, however."
"The numbers are clear: the vast majority of new infections occur in the developing countries, which means that HIV is one of the main factors slowing down the progress of thousands of settlements and communities."
"We are therefore talking about a global emergency, from both health and from social and economic points of view."
"We know what the problem is and we know how to prevent it and treat it."
"In order to do so, however, we need resources, political responsibility, responsibility on the part of economic sectors and social and cultural responsibility."
"For example, amongst other measures, we must guarantee universal access to vital medicines, something which is still not possible due to the greed of certain economic sectors, especially the pharmaceuticals sector, which has no scruples in this regard, and it therefore clearly shares responsibility for mass murder on a global scale."
"Furthermore, certain arguments from ultra-conservative sectors against sexual and reproductive health share responsibility for this situation."
"For example, given the information we have, to oppose appropriate sex education for everybody, particularly the youngest people, in this day and age, is, however you look at it, an affront against life and dignity, and is quite frankly immoral."
"This year once again, therefore, we must call for actions, for commitment, and above all we must demand that promises be kept."
"(HU) Mr President, we all know of the importance of the struggle against AIDS, and should be aware of our responsibility in this regard as well."
"It is to this that I attribute the fact that my opinion, submitted last week, has received so many proposed amendments."
"Last year there were nearly 40 million people on record living with AIDS, and the illness has truly reached every corner of the world."
"There are several reasons for its spread."
"Lack of information is first among these, but other important factors have been drug use and the lack of preparation on the part of some countries' health care systems."
"In my own country, testing was introduced 20 years ago, and it is to this that we owe the fact that the situation is not bad, yet problems are nonetheless present."
"The virus is spread 90% through sexual contact and 10% through drug use."
"Two further experiences: untreated sexually transmitted infections increase exponentially the risk of AIDS."
"People with HIV and AIDS find it much more difficult to obtain suitable medical care, if they are able to get any at all."
"The importance of prevention cannot be emphasised enough, and this includes information."
"This is especially important among highly vulnerable social groups and for secondary school students."
"We must take action."
"We have to help countries outside the Union as well, especially in neighbouring areas."
"The number of those diagnosed with the infection is constantly growing in some neighbouring countries."
"Reciprocal action is in the interests of us all."
"An integrated approach is needed, as the Commissioner has also stated, and we must take action."
"We all need to be partners in this effort."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution is a step in the right direction."
"I should like to add that the fight against AIDS is also an issue of governance, which must be dealt with at local level."
"I would remind you that in 2007, that is to say at present, 50% of the world's population live in cities."
"In many African cities, prevention and health care require local authorities to be involved in making those same cities more responsive to local needs and in removing social taboos, which are often very powerful."
"We must cooperate directly with the cities in order to help them manage their health services and in order to provide them with increased funding."
"I should have liked our resolution to have put forward a larger number of practical solutions to be employed on the ground."
"We could have asked the Commission to make it easier to offer combined treatments in the form of medicines combining three types of remedy in one and the same capsule - an arrangement that would have greatly simplified the treatment of patients living in areas in which hospitals, medicines and laboratories are few in number."
"We must promote the use of such treatments, ladies and gentlemen, as we have a pressing duty: to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shed light on this serious, worldwide problem from a number of perspectives."
"I think I can say that no objections have emerged in the debate that would undermine the broad strategic value of this document, in terms of either the ideas in the statement or the definition of the areas for action and the goals we need to achieve."
"I should like to emphasise the fundamental idea that the only way to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic is with the kind of coordinated, holistic approach that is currently deployed in the fight against poverty, in other words, preventative mechanisms that incorporate cultural norms, education, common sense, screening and care for the sick, including appropriate treatment."
"I think it is safe to say that the current results cannot be regarded as a success."
"Neither can we view them as empty words, since the progress that has been made is not inconsiderable."
"As for the fund, there has been a significant amount of financing."
"The EU is also providing significant resources to finance a range of projects in all countries and there have been some successes."
"The TRIPS agreement has been mentioned."
"As of this year, medicines can be produced more cheaply."
"I mentioned the fact that there have been times when prices have fallen by 98%."
"This is indeed noteworthy progress, but in no way could it be called a success."
"There is no doubt that we need to redouble our efforts."
"I should now like to turn to two specific issues, which I feel require a particular response."
"It was mentioned - though I am not sure I have understood correctly - that in the new Member States there are no suitable centres monitoring this epidemic."
"This observation is untrue; these centres are everywhere."
"If we compared their quality of course, we might find that some are better than others."
"Under the European Treaty there are not many possibilities for direct control, but the idea that these centres do not exist has no basis in reality."
"A further problem that was mentioned is the financing of the Fund against AIDS."
"The Commission has responded to the fact that the Member States are not contributing anything in 2007 by restructuring the resources."
"I think that one could debate whether this restructuring process has been carried out in the best possible manner, and whether different approaches might be considered, but I also think that the idea of restructuring was in essence a good one, because AIDS is a problem of massive proportions."
"In spite of this I believe that if Member States have undertaken to make certain contributions, which would not be significant amounts in relation to their GDP, they should fulfil that commitment."
"The overall amount of money is very significant, but in relation to GDP it is an amount that can be released in the context of national budgets."
"It is up to us to channel our efforts into reversing this unacceptable situation, because failure to do so would be unjustifiable and indefensible."
"I should also like to emphasise the importance of equal opportunities, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to overcoming this phenomenon and improving the situation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a strange quirk of human nature that we push some things into the background and bring others to the foreground."
"Take avian flu, for example, and the attention devoted to it."
"I do not wish, in any way, to underplay that tragedy, but HIV/AIDS is obviously a vastly more significant problem and yet we are unfortunately not devoting the same level of attention to it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this debate, which I feel has enabled us to advance further down this path."
"We must of course be aware that however much we channel all our efforts into resolving the problem, it is a worldwide problem and the chances of our making progress are thus limited."
"However, as the debate has clearly demonstrated, we must do all that we can to make use of those chances."
"To conclude the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Situation of people with disabilities"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-2007."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to be Parliament's rapporteur on the disability action plan."
"I worked closely with disabled people's organisations, the Commission and fellow MEPs, and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for their cooperation."
"I should also like to thank the Secretariat and I extend my special thanks to the European Disability Forum."
"I also sought advice from another 100 disability organisations across the European Union."
"I sincerely hope the report reflects the fact that it was produced not just by me but by the whole committee."
"I welcomed the Commission communication, but I felt there were some areas that could be strengthened."
"With regard to employment in particular, it is essential first and foremost to implement existing legislation, particularly the 2000 Employment Directive."
"I know the Commission is monitoring that closely."
"However, certain grey areas need to be clarified, such as reasonable accommodation or reasonable adjustment."
"It is also vital that trade unions inform people of their rights under anti-discrimination legislation."
"However, whatever we do in terms of employment, it is of little use to disabled people unless they have access to the built environment or to transport facilities."
"That is why one of my demands is further legislation on bus and coach travel, similar to that for air travel."
"I know the Commission is looking at that as well."
"Education and training are also the key to integration."
"I have always said that Member States should work towards including children in mainstream education wherever possible, but, at the same time, recognising that some children may not thrive in that atmosphere, especially if there is no proper back-up."
"Children's needs must come first."
"We also have to address access to information technology."
"That means accessible websites."
"At the moment, 80% of public websites are not accessible and we must ensure all documents are in accessible formats, particularly Commission and EU documents."
"We must also ensure that disabled children and adults have access to sporting facilities."
"However, one of the most important areas is the deinstitutionalisation of disabled people, but this needs a sufficient level of Community-based quality services."
"We must also destigmatise people with mental health problems."
"When we talk about disability, we must remember that we are talking about all forms of disability: people with mobility problems, hearing impairments, visual impairments, mental health problems, learning disabilities, chronic illnesses and other, hidden, disabilities."
"That is why I called in my report for a definition of disability."
"I welcome the Court of Justice ruling of 11 July, but we must take this forward."
"Another milestone was agreement earlier this year on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, for which I was Parliament's rapporteur."
"However, we must campaign now for the swift signing and ratification of the Convention."
"We must also continue our campaign for a specific disability directive under Article 13 to outlaw discrimination on access to goods and services."
"I make no apology for mentioning this repeatedly, and I have called for it in my report yet again."
"There is no point in paying lip service to disabled people's rights."
"We have to continue the fight for all EU citizens, disabled or non-disabled, to be treated equally."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for including this important issue on the agenda of today's plenary session."
"I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission have very similar opinions on the issue of disability."
"I should especially like to thank Parliament for its support in developing and implementing the European strategy for the disabled."
"This is not solely about providing disabled people with the opportunity to exercise their rights, the right to human dignity, to equal treatment, to freedom from dependence on others and to full integration in the community."
"Disabled people must be given the chance to develop their skills, to take part in the life of the community and to be economically active."
"The Commission action plan for equal opportunities for the disabled provides a strategic framework for establishing current priorities."
"As Mrs Lynne's report emphasises, the Community's policies and activities influence the situation of the disabled in a variety of ways."
"In 2003 the Council therefore recommended to the Member States that they comply in full with the action plan when drawing up their policies."
"At the end of 2005, I attended a meeting on equal opportunities for the disabled, which launched the second phase of the EU action plan for the disabled 2006-7 and which is addressed in the Lynne report."
"First let us look at where things currently stand."
"The figures available to the Commission tell their own story."
"There are 44.6 million people of working age - that is to say, every sixth EU citizen - with a long-term health problem or disability, according to their own assessment."
"Employment among the disabled is no more than 40%, as opposed to 64.2% among those without a disability."
"Even among those with disabilities that are relatively less serious, the employment rate is less than 50%."
"It has been established that the 43.7% of disabled people could work if they were given adequate assistance."
"The Commission's programme for 2006-7 seeks to address this situation."
"On a practical level, resources must be created to enable the disabled to exercise their rights, to have the same chances to vote as those without a disability, to make decisions on their own lives, to take part in the economic activities of life, to fulfil their potential in their personal and working life and to perform their duties just like any other citizen."
"Against this backdrop, four priority areas have been established for 2006-7."
"In its spring 2006 meeting, the Council also prioritised higher rates of employment and working activities for the disabled."
"The key point of next year's European Action Plan must be access for the disabled to high-quality, affordable services."
"Disabled access to material values and services is absolutely vital to ensuring that they exercise their rights as citizens and to guaranteeing their independence."
"The Union must be capable of better analysing and identifying the development of factors influencing the situation of the disabled."
"This Action Plan has already yielded positive results."
"The first European legislation specifically relating to the disabled has been adopted."
"This law on the rights and obligations of the disabled in the area of air transport has been mentioned by the rapporteur."
"Legislation relating to the new structural funds guarantees the rights of the disabled to access to Community-funded projects and lays down that the principle of access must be upheld at all stages of the fund's activity."
"The adoption of the UN Convention on the rights of the disabled is an event of historical significance."
"The European Community has for the first time in history signed up to the Convention."
"With this Convention the fundamental principles of the EU's strategy on the disabled - namely, non-discrimination, equal opportunities and active measures aimed at social integration - have gained solid foundations."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - I will speak on this item, as our chairman, Mr Sifunakis, has other duties today."
"However, we and every member of the PSE working party in the Committee on Culture and Education agree on the subject's importance."
"The year 2007 will be the European Year of Equal Opportunities, as part of which we must also give attention to disability in education and culture programmes."
"The new digital technologies, especially relating to the media, can provide equal opportunities for the disabled."
"It is crucial to use these tools for the advantage of disabled people."
"The European Union has important multiannual cultural programmes between 2007 and 2013."
"Our group wants to increase the involvement of people with disabilities in these programmes."
"Some weeks ago, I welcomed a group of visitors that included some disabled people."
"We, Members of this European Parliament, can also act at a personal level."
"Our possibilities may be modest, but we can invite more disabled visitors to Parliament."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European action plan 2006-2007 for people with disabilities identifies a strategy based on the principle of equal access to goods and services for every European citizen."
"This is a culture that is no longer associated with the idea of passive welfare but with the objective of integration, of active participation in economic and social life and of recognition for the safeguarding of these people's rights."
"The theme of quality of life takes centre stage, such that people with disabilities may fulfil their expectations while keeping their human dignity."
"That is why we emphasise the importance, too, of the relationship between the state of people's health and the environment in which they live."
"We support the formulation of the following three objectives: to finish implementing the directive on equal treatment in employment and working conditions; to do more to integrate disability-related issues in relevant Community polices; and to improve access for all."
"Our amendments have highlighted the need for a basically uniform approach in all of the Member States, in terms of transport and mobility, one that ensures that disabled people receive adequate support from the school and education system and within the home, and that also promotes sign language."
"It is also crucial to highlight the need to establish and enforce high European standards on quality in the social services, because the quality and fullness of people's lives in the future will depend on the quality of service that they receive."
"We therefore hope that ever more concrete, practical acts will follow on from the statement of principle."
"Finally, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her work."
"Mr President, the report by my honourable friend Mrs Lynne, whom I should like to congratulate on a cohesive and integrated piece of work, lays down the basic principles which the policy of the European Union and of the Member States needs to follow as far as disability is concerned."
"I should like to refer in particular to the safeguarding of accessibility for people with disabilities to the built environment."
"We need to remove the obstacles which prevent people with disabilities from participating in economic, social and cultural life."
"In precluding their natural access to goods and services, we are not only marginalising an important section of the populace, but also, at the same time, we are causing significant economic damage, as we are excluding them from the labour market and economic life in general, pushing them into a life on benefits, which cannot but be harmful."
"In addition, although I consider that mainstream education is a fundamental right of people with disabilities and makes a decisive contribution to their unimpeded integration into society and towards combating stigma and discrimination, we must not overlook the need to support special education structures as and where necessary."
"Similarly, I should like to stress the importance of the problems of mental health and the handicaps it causes and to underline the need to promote the mental health of the populace."
"I also wish to mention and to add that the adoption of a common definition of disability at European level will greatly facilitate the recognition of the common issues of people with disabilities for the purpose of adopting policies at European level which will give greater added value to national social policies in a sector which still - to a significant degree - comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"Finally, I wish to convey two points on behalf of my honourable friend, Mr Sifunakis, who drafted the opinion: firstly, the Commission must increase the involvement of people with disabilities in the new multi-annual programmes for the next budgetary period and, secondly, there must be a corresponding improvement in sports facilities."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, who have thoroughly studied and presented recommendations on one of today's most pressing social issues - the full integration into our society of people with disabilities."
"I support the numerous recommendations of those who prepared the report, which show that today there are still quite a few problems in this area."
"I would like to draw attention to some of them."
"Modern information technologies, the Internet and digital television open entirely new possibilities for adapting information to each user, with regard to his/her needs and potentials."
"These include wider use of subtitles and sign language on television, specially adapted workstations for disabled people and suitably adapted Internet interfaces, especially for public websites."
"We must encourage and ensure that all these possibilities are implemented."
"When new buildings are being designed, appropriate attention should be paid to the disabled."
"In future, improved transport systems will increase the mobility of these people."
"It is essential that these specialised needs be considered each time, especially when European Regional Development Fund and Structural Fund grants are being put to use."
"National law should be improved in parallel, removing all discriminatory provisions that are not in keeping with Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Further efforts should be made to renounce the medical model of disability and to replace it with a social model."
"It is most important that, in educating the public, all means adopted be accompanied by common efforts to eliminate stereotypes and preconceived notions in regard to the disabled."
"Only the coordinated and all-embracing efforts mentioned in the report will enable improved results to be obtained more rapidly."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) It is crucial that the noble promises of the Commission and the Member States to defend the rights of the disabled do not remain just rhetoric."
"More effective action must be taken, the existing legislation in this area must be effectively complied with and human rights for all must be guaranteed."
"We commend the rapporteur Mrs Lynne on her work and wish to underline the importance of the recommendations contained in her report, to which we contributed some proposals."
"We would like to highlight the effective application of the legal framework for equal treatment in employment, access for all to public transport and to new information technology, and the elimination of architectural barriers."
"We once again call for a specific directive on disability to be drawn up, based on Article 13 of the Treaty, and for the UN Convention in this area to be ratified and signed."
"I also wish to call for the Member States to focus more on disabled children and young people and their education, as well as the inclusion, wherever possible, of disabled students in mainstream education, taking account of the specific support required to meet the special educational needs of the pupils."
"Lastly, I should like to call for special focus on severely disabled people and their families."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I should like to thank Mrs Lynne for her excellent work."
"We are today dealing with an issue that is a measure of our humanity."
"Every time a disabled person is discriminated against, it is an attack on human rights and dignity."
"The concept of the disabled being able to enjoy their full rights as citizens must become more than fine-sounding words."
"It must be recognised that much has been achieved in this area over recent years."
"Nonetheless, it is still far too often the case that disabled people feel they are second class citizens."
"Integrating the world of disabled people with the rest of society represents a considerable challenge for the Member States."
"All kinds of barriers have to be removed."
"I mean here not only to the built environment and transport facilities, but also to access to work, medical care, social care, education, culture and sport for example."
"The issue of disability amongst children and young people is especially important."
"Disabilities can be physical, mental, acquired, or congenital."
"But I would also like to draw attention to the situation of those individuals who have become less able because of their advancing years."
"I am confident that the action taken by this House on this matter will lead to improved living conditions."
"This is not charity."
"It is our duty."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, the report on the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged European Union is actually more of a wish list for improving the quality of life of the disabled than a factual account and analysis of their present situation."
"In addition to the obvious issues relating to the built environment and transport, action is urgently needed to provide financial support for employers and compensate them for the losses they incur by employing disabled people who are less productive in the workplace."
"The issue of ongoing support of the educational process for the disabled and their carers is both a tremendous opportunity and a problem for families with disabled members."
"Making it possible for parents to stay at home for the necessary time and awarding them financial support so that they can live with dignity would be a step in the right direction."
"The European Union ought to make a commitment in this regard and ensure that the necessary resources are available."
"An order of priority for activities should be assigned to all guidelines aimed at improving the situation of the disabled, so that our aid and efforts do not become empty political declarations."
"In addition, the disabled need the certainty that the Member States of the Union are supporting them by imposing harsher punishments for offences against the disabled."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important day for this House and I would therefore like to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her report, because we are taking a further step in our task of building a Europe of opportunities."
"By means of a broad agreement, we shall approve new measures today that will represent progress in terms of equal opportunities for people with any kind of disability."
"I believe that this new European Action Plan 2006-2007 is a great challenge in terms of eliminating any kind of discrimination and, furthermore, it tackles the needs of people with disabilities throughout Europe."
"I shall highlight several issues."
"Firstly, it intends to establish a general framework for equal treatment in work, not just in terms of education and access, but also promotion and lifelong learning."
"Secondly, it undoubtedly improves the conditions and rights for passengers with disabilities using air, sea and land transport."
"I must warn you, however - as I have done in the report - of the need not to create a new and so far non-existent barrier: the economic barrier."
"To oblige people with disabilities to be accompanied is positive in terms of improving the quality of their journey, but it would not be a positive thing for the disabled person to have to pay for the ticket of the person accompanying them, since that would mean those people having to pay for two tickets, while the rest of us would only have to pay for one."
"Thirdly, the improvement in access to new technologies."
"There is no question that new technologies should break down many barriers for people with disabilities, provided that we achieve universal access to them and provided that technological advances take these people into account from the outset of their design stage."
"Fourthly, we need integrated and coordinated responses to disability amongst children and amongst people who are already suffering other forms of discrimination, such as women and the elderly."
"Finally, the prevention of work risks."
"We have opted for a broad agreement on work-related risks, which has already been presented in this House, and which the Commission has not yet taken up - and I would remind you of this, Mr Špidla - and in which particular attention will have to be paid to the possible risks faced by people in the workplace."
"I would also like to stress the extremely important role played by disabled people's associations."
"There is no question that this is a great challenge and that it represents progress towards achieving the Europe of opportunities that we all want to see."
"I join with the rapporteur in reiterating Parliament's support for a comprehensive non-discrimination directive on disability under Article 13."
"The Portuguese Presidency promised it to us in 2000, as did the former Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs in 2003."
"Four years later and unless there is action, the Commission will continue saying that there is a hierarchy of discrimination, which none of us can accept."
"Secondly, I welcome the action plan's emphasis on moving beyond employment rights to social care."
"I call on the Commission to undertake this work with a genuine spirit and commitment towards an independent lifestyle for people with disabilities, to the right to personal assistance and to the right for disabled people and disabled children and their parents to choose mainstream provision, whether that is education or housing, not only employment."
"Thirdly, we can do much more on the international front in external assistance."
"We claim to adopt a human rights approach to disability."
"Let us do more within our human rights programmes worldwide."
"We have not done enough regarding the human rights of disabled people in assessing candidate countries for accession to the European Union."
"We can do better in that area."
"We should not only move swiftly to ratify and sign the draft UN Convention on People with Disabilities but work with third-country governments to make sure they do too."
"Finally on PPE-DE Group's Amendment 5, I am outraged that the Conservatives should try to withdraw the part of my text suggesting that the Commission should be required to monitor the participation of people with disabilities in their programmes."
"We should not just talk about participation, we should make it happen."
"The PPE-DE Group should withdraw that amendment."
"Madam President, the European Union is a society of shared values."
"One way by which we judge our success as a society is how we address the issues facing the most vulnerable members of our society."
"Last year, as rapporteur on the Commission paper on demographic change, I was invited to speak at a special conference on disability in Graz during the Austrian Presidency."
"The banner on the platform behind me said simply: Leben wie andere auch - to live the same as other people."
"In English the translation of the word 'leben' is not just 'to live' but 'to have a life', and it should be the aim of our society to help all members of society to live and to have a life like every other member of society."
"UK Conservatives are not persuaded that we need more EU legislation to secure this aim, but we do believe that we need the whole of society to embrace it."
"We need not just a welfare state, but a welfare society, in which communities recognise their responsibilities for the support of all members of those communities."
"Governments cannot do everything, but they can become enablers of individual choice, helping people with disabilities to do what they themselves want to do by removing the barriers that stand in their way - barriers in education, employment or simply in getting from A to B. Governments can also promote and enable a culture of independence rather than dependence."
"Support for people with disabilities is not just about care: it is about support for their desires to fulfil their lives and to live in the same way as other people."
"We welcome this thoughtful own-initiative report on this important subject, we shall of course be supporting it, and we congratulate the rapporteur."
"(Beginning of speech off-microphone) ... particularly what the Commissioner was just saying about how close together the Parliament and the Commission are in terms of disabled people's rights."
"Commissioner, you talked about the accessibility of services."
"Of course, we can only have accessibility of services if we have a specific disability directive."
"I am pleased that Richard Howitt and many other Members brought that up as well."
"I would like some sort of commitment today as regards a timescale of when you might be bringing that forward, Commissioner."
"I welcome what you were saying about structural funds."
"It is very important that we have a disability criterion in the structural funds."
"I am very pleased that it is in there now."
"One of the Members here also talked about mainstreaming."
"It is very important that we should have that."
"Mrs Tzampazi, thank you very much for all your support and work."
"We have worked very closely on this."
"It is very right to talk about the European Year of People with Disabilities and to build on that."
"Unfortunately, I have not had enough time to talk about education and training."
"There are so many points that I would like to mention, but really the bottom line is a specific disability directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the debate, which I have followed with interest."
"I feel that Mrs Lynne's conclusion corresponds to the situation on the ground and I was delighted to learn of the committee's view that the opinions of Parliament and the Commission are very close to one another."
"The most important principles, namely those of non-discrimination and active inclusion, were raised and some issues were clarified or followed from a number of different perspectives in the debate."
"As several speakers have mentioned changes to the European legal framework, I should like to point out that a feasibility study will be completed this year on how to improve the EU legal framework on the disabled."
"Honourable Members, perhaps it is also appropriate to mention that 2007 is the Year of Equal Opportunities, which in my view provides a good opportunity to mobilise the Community."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(IT) I give my full support to the Lynne report, insofar as it has succeeded in addressing a broad range of the problems affecting the world of disabilities, as diverse as it is, and has proposed actions and instruments that are sufficiently appropriate to meet the associated requirements in terms of people's lives, relationships and place in society."
"I should also like to express the hope, in this House, that the statements of principle, which I support, will pave the way for ever more concrete, practical acts on the part of the Commission and that 'people with disabilities' (or, if one prefers, 'people with different abilities') might achieve their life goals while keeping their human dignity."
"With the work done by the rapporteur in our parliamentary committee, the text on which we are preparing to vote successfully summarises, among other things, the social needs arising from the various national situations."
"I would stress, in this respect, that it is advisable for the Member States of the European Community to adopt a basically uniform approach, so as to prevent unjustified inequalities from materialising among Europeans in this regard just because they come from different parts of Europe."
"(HU) People with disabilities in Europe today face particular difficulties and discrimination at several levels."
"In most places even basic, unobstructed mobility has not been made possible, not to mention social integration."
"It is important for this to be made known: independent living does not only mean that one is simply a member of society, but that one is just as much a member of society as anyone else."
"Every policymaker and decision-maker should give this matter due consideration."
"People living with disabilities make up 10% of Europe's population, and therefore their integration and ability to function is not merely a social question but a mutual interest, since the creation of workplaces for disabled people, and their involvement in lifelong education and vocational training contributes not only to improving their living conditions, but to the development of the economy of Europe as well."
"Finding an approach to the question is problematic as well, and not only because statistical data in this area are inadequate."
"People with disabilities certainly constitute a diverse, far from homogeneous group, and therefore the numerous challenges in this area require an integrated, gender-based approach; this point must be taken into consideration at every level of policymaking."
"What is more, as in many other areas, the situation of women living with disabilities is often more disadvantaged than that of men with disabilities, and women are more often the victims of poverty and social exclusion."
"This must be taken into consideration in the wide range of programmes and measures."
"(SV) The June List believes that it is completely unacceptable for people with disabilities to encounter prejudices, unhelpful special treatment and limited opportunities."
"Such experiences are not in accordance with our view of the EU as a union of values."
"The European Parliament's and the Council's Regulation of 5 July 2006 constitutes progress, then, and clarifies something that should be self-evident, especially since we have a common internal market: namely, that people with disabilities should have the same rights as other citizens where flying is concerned."
"Sweden is a pioneering country when it comes to the rights of people with disabilities."
"Far-reaching EU legislation, involving detailed perspectives on how people with disabilities are to be treated, might have placed a question mark over the successful Swedish reforms of the Seventies and Eighties."
"Let us, then, do without detailed regulation and instead state clearly and unambiguously that society, trade and industry and the rest of us as individuals should treat people with disabilities exactly the same as other people."
"Let us, in conclusion, practise some self-criticism."
"The EU institutions present reports on the rights of people with disabilities but cannot, at the same time, ensure that all EU buildings are fully adapted for their purposes."
"Nor are the European Union's websites and documents accessible in suitable formats to people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired."
"When do the Quaestors in the European Parliament and the relevant EU authorities intend to take action on these urgent issues of such close concern?"
"Time to move up a gear Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth"
"The next item is the report by Mrs del Castillo Vera, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Time to move up a gear - Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently debating a report that is going to be voted on this morning and which deals jointly with a number of reports presented by the Commission with one fundamental and very well defined objective, which is no less than to establish a range of measures enabling us to develop a knowledge-based society and economy in Europe, which is ultimately the fundamental instrument for generating employment and growth and therefore prosperity for all Europeans."
"In this report, like other reports by experts, such as the Aho report, which is an extremely complete and precise report dealing with the same issues, or other previous Commission reports, we are being presented with a situation in which we have a very good diagnosis - I would say - of where we are, why we are in this situation and what we need."
"There is probably no other area in which we have such precise knowledge as in this one, allowing us to promote growth in Europe."
"We have a diagnosis and we also have the solutions."
"We all know that in order to promote a knowledge-based society we need to promote innovation."
"We all know that we need to promote training so that people can adapt to all the changing situations in employment and can recycle themselves and find new kinds of work."
"We all know that innovation is necessary so that the social welfare system does not lose its capacity to meet the citizens' needs in terms of health, training, etc."
"We all know, too, that companies need a favourable framework, a framework that helps them, that encourages them to develop innovation and that prevents them from having to deal with bureaucratic problems, with difficulties in a whole range of fields of action."
"This is not the time to list each of the aspects of the report, because they are there and you all know about them."
"I would like to take this opportunity to place as much emphasis as I can on the need to stop all the talk once and for all and to stop giving reports and analyses wonderful titles, while there is still a degree of paralysis in the national States' actions."
"The step that has been taken in relation to the 25 national reform programmes is important, but I believe that we should place extremely great emphasis on a very thorough assessment of the progress made with those national programmes."
"As time passes, we are being left further and further behind."
"When the Lisbon Agenda was drawn up, there were expectations in terms of how things would develop."
"At the half-way point in the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda, the European average - the situations vary from country to country, of course - was worse than when the Lisbon Agenda was drawn up."
"We may find that in 2010 we have still failed to make any progress and that we have therefore got further and further behind."
"I truly believe that if we were to hire an external auditor, they would be amazed to see what a good diagnosis we have, and what good remedies and solutions we have, but that, in spite of that, there has been such a complete lack of action in their application."
"Like life itself, societies are created by means of cooperation amongst different generations."
"One generation carries the baton; it is like a relay race, but it is our foundations that are being passed on."
"Many Europeans are currently growing up and being born."
"Others, like ourselves, will be retired before too long."
"All of us need a society in which Europe can continue to have that capacity to compete, to have the leadership and sense of future that it has had in the past, because Europeans used to be determined, with their hearts and souls, to leave a better legacy for the future of their countries and, in our case, for the future of all of the countries making up European society."
"That is our responsibility, therefore, and we must put our hearts and souls into it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity to participate in this debate on growth and employment policy and we are quite clear in welcoming the present report."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, most warmly for her thorough and objective consideration of the issues involved."
"We are having this debate a few days before the Commission's decision on the progress report on growth and employment policy in 2006."
"I share Mrs del Castillo Vera's analysis that we, in Europe, do in fact know perfectly well where our problems are."
"We also know exactly what needs to be done."
"We have the right answers to the problems but - and this is where Mrs del Castillo Vera got it quite right - there is a problem with the implementation of the measures deemed correct, in particular at the national level."
"It is also easy to explain why."
"The long-term needs for reform that we have identified for European growth and employment policy always come up against the short-term interests of national politics."
"There are always elections somewhere. The machinery always grinds to a halt somewhere."
"Even so, I am in a position to tell you today that the progress report that we will be adopting in a fortnight will be sending out two uncommonly positive signals."
"The first signal is that, for the first time, we actually have a functioning mechanism in Europe to coordinate the economic policies of the Member States and the EU itself."
"That, of course, was the big problem with the Lisbon Strategy, as you identified, in that while its aims were very ambitious, its implementation mechanism was practically non-existent."
"The second positive answer is that the priorities of the Member States have changed to a noticeable degree."
"We will be able to show in our reports, which cover every single country and every single sector of the economy, that the issues in our strategy are now on the agenda all over Europe. These issues are education and training, research and development, innovation, better conditions for businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, and improving the employability of those social groups denied access to the labour market."
"These issues are all the hottest topics on the political agenda in every Member State, and so I am very pleased that the report under discussion today has very clear things to say on precisely these subjects."
"I would like to emphasise in the clearest possible way how much I welcome the fact that this report so clearly endorses Commission policy in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises and to innovation."
"I would like to state very clearly that the future of our growth and our jobs depends on our success in bolstering the innovation potential in small and medium-sized enterprises such that they are able to contribute more and more to growth and employment in Europe."
"It is from this sector that the extra jobs that we need will come, and so it is important that all of our policies are assessed in respect of whether or not they allow Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises the leeway they need."
"We will very soon be in a position to debate the state of growth and employment policy on the basis of the Commission's progress report."
"I am fairly sure, Mrs del Castillo Vera, that, when that happens, you will share my opinion that Europe is not in a state of stagnation. We are, rather, clearly moving in the right direction."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union definitely needs renewed impetus in order to bridge that gap, that divide that exists in relation to the world's other strong, dynamic, competitive economies: I am not just referring to the traditional ones, but to the new ones, too, which have made an appearance on the international stage."
"Europe is therefore risking a great deal if it is unable to keep pace and to modernise by giving itself that impetus and that extra something that is being requested of it, not least through this debate."
"It is in danger of losing that compatibility that it has always been able to demonstrate between economic, productive and industrial growth and, at the same time, social cohesion and the ability to promote employment and a more inclusive kind of growth."
"I believe that this 'extra something' requires two elements."
"Firstly, we need to take action regarding new factors of economic and employment growth: human capital, the training of human capital, the enhancement of people's abilities and skills, and technological innovation, which is also understood to mean the ability to transfer the results of research and of what knowledge today places at our disposal into production processes."
"There is a second element, however, which I should like to mention in closing, and which is key to overcoming this challenge: Europe needs to work together more!"
"Europe needs to provide itself with this strategic ability that is a common outlook."
"Twenty-five national plans are weakening our ability to grow together: we need one outlook, a more univocal outlook."
"We need, in short, more harmonised policies in the fields of taxation, of employment and of industrial policies."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Madam President, in olden times young people learned their professions in the workshops of older masters."
"In Hungary, before the World Wars and the Iron Curtain, many young people went to western Europe for some years to extend their vocational training by working in the workshops of foreign masters."
"In this way, they learned both their profession and one or two foreign languages."
"We should not invent new things, we should just remember the old traditions."
"Of course, times have changed and the state has an important role in vocational training."
"However, as with the individual masters or guilds in the old times, small and medium-sized companies should be involved in providing practical experience for students."
"Our projects in the field of vocational training are rather modest."
"We must provide more financial resources for programmes that provide foreign experience and possibly the exchange of students."
"Vocational training should also provide language courses, including business technology phrases."
"It is nice to learn the Hamlet monologues by heart, but carpenters or computer operators should know their professional terms in foreign languages as well."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, and thank her for all the work undertaken on an issue of such great importance for the future of the European economy."
"We are unfortunately bound to recognise that the European Community's economic results are consistently disappointing, particularly when we take into account the opportunities offered by the single European market."
"Particular attention should be paid to the difficulties experienced by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"After all, SMEs are among the powerhouses of the European economy."
"Better regulation and simplification are crucial to increasing the cohesion and clarity of Community legislation and would help to reduce the administrative burden weighing so heavily on SMEs."
"Future legislative proposals should adopt a broad and comprehensive approach based on detailed consideration of current legislation and an in-depth assessment of the implications."
"There should be regular contact with SMEs and the organisations representing them so that they can be involved in the implementation and further development of Community programmes."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, first of all, allow me to thank our rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, and to congratulate her on her excellent report, especially since it is structured around clear sets of themes designed to improve monitoring of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I think, moreover, that one issue in particular ought to get us moving: that of reviewing the Community Patent."
"For too long, we have been saying, as Mrs del Castillo Vera said just now, that it is crucial for innovation to be promoted via harmonisation at European level."
"Now, what we are saying needs to be heard."
"We talk about producing better legislation, and the scope of such legislation is vast."
"There is also, however, cause to be surprised that Europe is so far behind in terms of innovation."
"Bearing in mind, however, that a patent costs on average EUR 46 700 in Europe compared with EUR 10 250 in the United States, I think that we know, unfortunately, why this is so."
"Charging as much as that is the best way of stifling innovation in Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This cost is utterly prohibitive."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency to get the Council to think again and help extricate our companies from this unfortunate situation."
"I should now also like to emphasise another important point that we ought to have taken up in this report, namely the Agreement on Public Procurement."
"In the process of being reorganised under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, this Agreement offers the 36 signatories, including our 25 Member States, access to their partners' public procurement markets."
"Nonetheless, a number of these partners are not playing by the rules."
"One has only to look at what the United States and Canada do."
"By means of national provisions, they exclude from the scope of the Agreement those public procurement markets that they reserve for their SMEs, even though these countries can put themselves forward in the public procurement markets of the 25 Member States."
"I find it unacceptable that the progress made in transatlantic relations is all in the same direction."
"We therefore have a duty to promote a European Small Business Act on the model of that in place in the United States since 1953."
"We might be said to be 50 years behind."
"You will agree that enough is enough."
"It remains for us to come up with better legislation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we keep on reminding ourselves, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of Europe's economy, employing most of Europe's workers, yet still not without their problems."
"I want to point out that the first communication from the Commission in which many problems were addressed reached us in July 1994, followed by recommendations in December of the same year, a second communication in 1998, and then, in 2000, experts found out that not even half of the measures were being put into effect in the Member States."
"It is necessary to note that, even today, only 55% of them have been, so the Member States have to back up their words with actions."
"I would like to say something about the transfer of undertakings, which is an important matter to which too little attention is given when considering the problem as a whole, not only on the part of the authorities responsible for Member States' tax laws but also by the enterprises themselves, which have to start work in good time on the business of transferring their enterprise to a new owner."
"There is work to be done by all parties involved."
"Not least in the Seventh Research Programme, this House has taken action in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises; enough words have been bandied back and forth, so now is the time for some action."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the preparation of her speech."
"Essentially I agree with her."
"This is yet one more document among a multitude of others that should encourage entrepreneurship in Europe - starting with the expansion of small and medium-size enterprises."
"Indeed the Community's policy on this question is consistent and, I would say, fair."
"The problem is that in real life it is often not observed."
"Laws are frequently ignored and bureaucratic obstacles are created."
"I would like to point out two problems: I think the success of small and medium-size enterprises depends on their solution."
"Firstly, there is a problem with business registration procedures."
"The Commission has promised that by the end of 2007 the so-called One-Window Principle would be implemented in the entire Community."
"At the Summit Meeting in March, the Member States also agreed to simplify registration procedures for new enterprises."
"It was agreed that they should not take longer than one week."
"However, in reality business registration in some Community countries now takes from one day to several weeks."
"Registration costs also differ markedly."
"In certain countries it does not cost anything, yet elsewhere the cost can amount to hundreds of euros."
"The second problem - control over the activities of enterprises, overseen by various State institutions."
"In Lithuania at the present time, 152 controlling bodies are in operation."
"Business people mention this as one of the biggest problems and sources of corruption."
"Recently 300 Commission employees made a commitment that by 2009 they would work for at least one week in small and medium-size enterprises."
"That way they will attempt to understand the problems."
"This is a welcome and concrete step."
"Perhaps similar initiatives should be extended to other parts of Europe, but would the Community endorse them?"
"I am certain that we will have to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to business expansion."
"Then we will be able to say that we are creating Europe through business and that we are encouraging its growth."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you."
"I have no doubt that achievements in innovation, the skill to make use of them and the capacity to revive the entrepreneurial environment, particularly in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, will establish Europe's place in global economic competition."
"Europe must adopt a proactive and leading position on global economic and social regulation."
"Thus, for example, if we wish to catch up with the USA in the sphere of innovation where, according to an assessment by the European Commission, we are currently lagging behind by 50 years, it is vital to change existing relations between science and business, and between business and the regulatory role of the state, as well as the models for funding science."
"Restrictions, not lack of enterprise, are the reason why the majority of Europe's residents want to be employees and not employers."
"We welcome the report's emphasis on the role of the common market in fostering entrepreneurial activity."
"The spheres in which the common market is not functioning properly are services and the free movement of labour."
"A task that is behind schedule in the promotion of the free movement of labour is achieving comparability between Member States' degrees and qualifications, which has become particularly topical following the 2004 enlargement and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"I hope that the report will stimulate MEPs to rethink and understand the errors that have crept in, not least in the recently adopted services directive, and in rejecting the introduction of the European patent."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, just for a moment I should like to test our wonderful interpreters."
"'European Union entrepreneurship' is an oxymoron, is it not?"
"The whole raison d'être - if I may lapse into the vernacular of this place - is to stifle small business."
"Rule upon rule, regulation upon regulation are generally made by people with no commercial experience at all."
"I went through the list of over 700 MEPs just yesterday, and I could not find more than about 5 people who had bona fide business experience."
"The Commissioners go on the Microsoft yacht for their holidays, the British Prime Minister has close relations with Lord Browne of BP, and so on and so forth, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with business."
"Business in Western Europe is millions upon millions of small businessmen and women living a life of quiet desperation, trying to put their livelihoods together."
"Small businesses account for over 52% of the UK's GDP."
"You tell us in this place what age we may recruit at; you tell us what colour they may be; you tell us how much leave they must have; you tell us how much their pensions will be."
"It goes on and on."
"If we really wanted to get this place sorted out and we really wanted entrepreneurship, I would suggest that we only have Commissioners and MEPs who have actually done an honest day's work in their lives."
"There are none!"
"(Applause from the public gallery)"
"While I can indeed understand that some of the speeches made in this House meet with the approval or disapproval of visitors, I really must ask those in the galleries to refrain from expressing their views."
"Madam President, I wonder how many people in this Chamber have had an idea for a new business, raised the money themselves at their own risk and successfully run that business for 20 more years and generated jobs and wealth."
"I see that not a hand goes up, and yet here we have a Commission talking about authorising entrepreneurs and about level playing fields - which is the most fundamental contradiction of the word 'entrepreneur' you could possibly imagine."
"The whole point about entrepreneurship is creating something that nobody has ever thought of before."
"There sits the Commissioner talking about criminalising the use of imperial measurements on exports from the UK after 2009."
"As a consequence of that, the manufacturers of tyres, bicycles, clothing, medical equipment, dairy products, frozen foods, specialist papers, domestic appliances, hand tools, computer components and oil and gas components will all suffer, every single one of them."
"One of them in my constituency will be faced with going out of business because there is no way he will be able to sell his components to the oil and gas industry in the United States."
"They are not going to pull their drill up thousands of feet just to check a measurement - no way!"
"He will either become a criminal to stay in business or he will go out of business."
"Years ago I walked into the office of one of the biggest industrialists in the United States and behind him was a notice that said: 'If you are not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, so get out of the way!'"
"That is a message I commend to this House."
"(PL) Madam President, there are many reasons why the European Union loses out when competing with other countries."
"It does badly against both highly industrialised and developing countries."
"I cannot run through all the factors involved, but the main ones are inadequate support for SMEs and inadequate investment in science and education."
"I would, however, like to focus on a different aspect today, namely the very marked differences in development within the European Union, at both national and regional level."
"If we are to create a genuine European scientific and technological area, we will first have to bridge the gap between the richer and poorer Member States."
"This obviously calls for additional resources, by which I mean not just the structural funds or funds allocated to agriculture, but also to resources for research and development, science and education."
"Unfortunately, the richer countries have managed to secure almost all the funding set aside for such purposes, arguing that they are more effective in these areas."
"It should therefore come as no surprise that the differences between the rich and poor parts of the Union are becoming more rather than less marked, and that the European Union is developing at a significantly lower rate than the United States or the Asian countries."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two more things I should like to say."
"The first is that, however much one might wish to go along with the criticism of the conditions - and the Commission, as you know, does not hold back when criticism is merited - there is one thing that should not be overlooked, and that is that Europe's economic statistics show an upward trend."
"Growth this year has surpassed expectations by far; a fall in unemployment is making itself very definitely felt; European firms are producing more, and we are becoming very much aware that the Member States' priorities are changing as they become keener to improve the conditions for entrepreneurship."
"Secondly, when compared with - for example - the United States, it is indeed the case that there are fewer people in Europe who are prepared to set up a business themselves or to run one, or - to put it in the way a Member did a moment ago - to take upon themselves the risk of using their own money to create jobs for others."
"The causes underlying this are very interesting, and are to be found in our culture."
"It is for that reason too that the Commission has been such an energetic advocate of coupling together entrepreneurship and education; as early as at school and university, it must be possible to guide young people towards entrepreneurial activity."
"Remarkable successes are making themselves visible in the countries in which this is being done, while, in those where it is not, there are quite simply too few enterprises, and the plain and simple fact is that no jobs will be created in the absence of a business to create them."
"What we are currently learning - and it is a matter of considerable interest - is that 'learning by doing' is still the best way to go about it."
"Reference has already been made in this debate to the 'Enterprise Experience' project, which I started with the aim of getting all the senior civil servants from my own offices to work in a small or medium-sized enterprise for at least a week."
"The first fifty to do so have now got back, and the results are fascinating."
"Every one of them - and yes, I really do mean every one of them - has come back with important proposals for improvements, for ways in which we can make life easier for small and medium-sized businesses, and these deserve to be the subject of serious discussion."
"On the other hand, though, the firms that took our official on and enabled these to work for them say that they learned a great deal from it and now have a far better idea of what is feasible at the European level and of what is not."
"I really do want to encourage the Member States to take similar initiatives."
"Businesses change so quickly that it is absolutely necessary that those who create the conditions under which they operate should have a real knowledge, derived from their own observations, of what actually goes on in them and of what effect what they do has on them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs del Castillo Vera on the subject of entrepreneurship and growth."
"This report is an essential contribution to achieving the objectives laid down in the relaunched Lisbon Strategy, designed to make Europe the most competitive region in the world by refocusing on growth and employment while maintaining the balance between the three pillars of the process: the economy, the social dimension and the environment."
"If the EU wants successfully to meet this enormous challenge to bring about growth and employment, it needs to take account of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which, let us not forget, account for 70% of the total number of jobs in Europe, with 75 million workers."
"Having constructed the internal market by taking an interest in consumers at the same time as relying on competition, the EU must from now on take an interest in producers and, while protecting us from the harmful aspects of globalisation, ensure that European creativity is given full rein."
"Finally, I deplore the fact that the disastrous monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has not been criticised, as monetary policy is not being put sufficiently at the service of economic growth."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed for voting time at 11.00 a.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to invoke the Rules of Procedure."
"A number of Members, including myself, are concerned."
"It seems that additional security measures have been taken in this House."
"Have you any information to give us, or are these simply about scaring employees intending to take union action?"
"I am not aware of any particular reason why there should be additional security measures, but we shall check and inform the House."
"Thank you for that observation, Mr Henin."

"European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, on 12 October, when Parliament last voted on the report on the regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, we asked for it to be referred back to committee under Rule 53(2)."
"Since then, the Council and the Commission have decided to add political declarations to complement the legal document."
"This was accepted by Parliament in a round of trialogue discussions."
"I would therefore ask the House to vote in favour in the final vote on these issues and not block the process any more."
"7."
"Fundamental Rights Agency - activities under Title VI of the EU Treaty (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, my report called for extending the competence of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to the third pillar."
"I ask my fellow Members to continue to support this recommendation, and to vote for Parliament's original proposal."
"For my part, I have taken note that the political declaration contains this proposal to a slightly limited degree."
"8."
"Accession of Bulgaria (vote)"
"- Before the vote on amendment 2:"
"Mr President, with regard to amendment 2 by my group, I should like to tell you that the Van Orden report brings this Parliament away from the legal basis of the accession protocol."
"(DE) We have stipulated in the accession protocol that the Kosloduj nuclear power station must be shut down."
"Contrary to what the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has asserted, nothing has been said by the Council or by Euratom to alter this view, which has to do with safety, and I therefore call on the Members of this House to agree to our amendment in order that we may not be in breach of the accession protocol."
"Thank you, Mrs Harms."
"We take the point, but I do not want to reopen the debate now."
"- After the vote on amendment 2:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I tried to take the floor before we voted on that last vote."
"You gave the floor to someone that was opposing the position which the rapporteur had taken on this particular issue."
"It was quite wrong to say that there was anything here going against the Accession Treaty."
"All we were asking for was more flexibility on this issue."
"In view of that, I would ask that we do indeed vote on amendment nine."
"I know the vote was very close, Mr Van Orden, but I do not think what Mrs Harms had to say affected the outcome of the vote."
"I think the reaction of the House to her remarks indicates that everybody knew what she was going to say."
"I do not propose to reopen the vote, though."
"That would be wrong."
"I am sorry about that, and I apologise for not having seen your hand up."
"However, on the other hand I do not think we can change the vote."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, we are not asking to reopen the vote, we are asking to vote on the text that we have in front of us."
"I am afraid that the intervention did in fact influence things as regards that particular amendment."
"The difference was only three or four votes."
"I really think that we should give the House the opportunity to vote on the other amendments as put forward there."
"I take the point, Mr Van Orden, but I am afraid we cannot reopen it."
"It was a roll-call vote and it was a clear result, even though it was close."
"Even if the Chair has some flexibility when it is a show of hands, I am afraid in these circumstances it is not possible to reopen it."
"(Applause)"
"9."
"Accession of Romania (vote)"
"10."
"Research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013, FP7) (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - I just wish to inform the House that the compromise package of amendments, which is in the first block, and amendment 15 represent a hard-negotiated compromise with the Council and the Commission."
"I would urge colleagues to vote for the package and against any other amendment, irrespective of its content or merits, because we have an agreement that will enable the Framework Programme to go forward and be implemented in January."
"Adopting any other amendment might put that at risk by reopening the procedure, which would be a matter of great concern to the research community."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tabled two amendments: numbers 47 and 48."
"However, with regard to the second one, number 48, the common position has been corrected in line with the aim of this amendment."
"I am therefore satisfied, since there is no sense in voting on an amendment that has already been accepted."
"The second part of the other amendment has been declared inadmissible, that is to say the part that specifies today's date, 30 November, as the deadline for destroying embryos used for the procurement of stem cells."
"I do not agree with the declaration of inadmissibility, against which I can unfortunately do nothing."
"What remains of the article is the replacement of the word 'extraction', as it features in the common position, with the word 'use', as Parliament was proposing back at the stage of first reading."
"This is an issue of secondary importance, although, with the Commissioner having stated last night that, throughout the entire development phase of the programme, the Commission would accept the word 'use' and not the word 'extraction' - which, in practice, means that it will not fund any research into the destruction of embryos - I feel that this is a proposal that deserves to be endorsed."
"Therefore, on this point, I would say that we should not insist on the vote if the Members that have signed the amendment agree."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the speech made by my fellow Member, Mr Casini, and to the amendment tabled by myself and others, Amendment 49."
"Last night, Mr Potočnik gave ample reassurances regarding the Commission statement, with which I, for my part, am already satisfied, and I do not think it necessary to insist on the amendment in question."
"Of course, that is my view on the matter, but if there are others affected, they can obviously insist on it."
"(FR) Mr President, I think that it is necessary to return to Mr Chichester's proposal."
"The package as a whole has to be voted on, and some people's interpretations of the Commission's reply are incorrect."
"The Commission has been very clear."
"It said that it was going to apply the Agreement Protocol - an annexed statement aimed at ensuring that research on spare embryonic stem cells takes place in very strict conditions governed by ethical considerations."
"It is not, therefore, a question of reopening a debate."
"It is the same thing each time, and I think that Mr Chichester's proposal needs to be adhered to."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, now that Mr Busquin has spoken, we really do have a problem."
"Yesterday, the Commission took up a clear position;"
"Mr Casini and Mr Prodi have commented on it, and Mr Busquin has just now cast doubt on it."
"Mr Prodi and Mr Casini have hinted that they are going to withdraw their amendments, but we do appear to need another confirmation before this vote goes ahead, and so I would ask that Mr Potočnik be again given the floor in order to repeat the statement he made yesterday."
"(Protest)"
"We are being told different things, and yet we must be in a position to proceed with the vote with it being clear to everyone what we are voting on."
"Thank you, Mrs Breyer."
"The position is simple."
"Mr Casini has withdrawn his amendments; he has made his political statement."
"Mr Prodi and Mr Busquin have made their positions clear."
"Everybody understands that it is the wish of the House to proceed on the basis of the block votes, and that is what we shall now do."

"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I am the shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group."
"Yesterday we had a vote based on information regarding Amendments 22 and 23."
"We knew that the different fusion associations held different views."
"I should therefore like to tell my group that we have received a letter from the Fusion Association stating it is unanimously in favour of the way in which we voted in committee."
"Therefore, I should like to ask colleagues to change their vote on Article 2(2) and vote against those amendments."
"22."
"Area of freedom, security and justice (vote)"
"23."
"AIDS (vote)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 19:"
"Mr President, as sometimes happens, a few words get lost in the negotiations or between them and the printed word, and with the support of all the groups involved, I should like to move the addition after paragraph 19 of the following new paragraph: 'Calls for greater investment in the development and provision of paediatric formulations for children;'."
"- The oral amendment was accepted."
"24."
"Situation of people with disabilities (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the English version of paragraph 40 should apply."
"Apparently there were problems with the French and Spanish translations of 'moving away from the institutionalisation of people with disabilities'."
"In English 'moving away' does not mean 'abandon' but a gradual approach."
"In paragraph 47, 'Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS)' should be replaced with 'instrument for accession (ISPA).'"
"25."
"Time to move up a gear - Creating a Europe of entrepreneurship and growth (vote)"
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"I have had a request from a number of Members, who have unavoidable commitments that will prevent them from being here for the whole of the vote, that the votes on Mr Van Orden's report on Bulgaria and Mr Moscovici's report on Romania be moved up the list."
"I therefore propose that we take the votes on the Bulgaria and Romania reports after the simplified procedure votes."
"Are there any objections to that change in the voting order?"
"(DE) Mr President, there is, essentially, of course, no reason to move reports up the list simply because a few Members cannot be here, but Bulgaria, Romania, and their accession are of such importance that we can, by way of exception, agree to this."
"(Parliament agreed to the change in the voting order)"

"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 30 November 2006."
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 30 November 2006 have been distributed."
"Are there are any comments?"
"(NL) Mr President, as you will remember and as is also evident from the Minutes, we held the debate on World AIDS Day and Europe's measures in this field on Thursday, which featured the issue of the Global Health Fund and funding."
"In the debate with the Commission, it became apparent that Parliament was extremely anxious about the lack of funding; the reason why it quizzed the Commission about the development instrument - which will be the subject of tomorrow's debate - was that this instrument was at risk of being looted in favour of the Global Health Fund, with the risk of the same mistake being made twice."
"I can inform you that we in the Committee on Development received a letter from the Commission on 3 December in which it still pledges to get the funds for the Global Health Fund from the European Development Fund and to leave the programming of the thematic section of the development instrument alone."
"We will continue this debate tomorrow, but it is good to make a mental note of this."
"I am sorry, Mr Van den Berg, but I do not understand how what you have said relates to the Minutes of the sitting."
"Are you suggesting any amendment of the Minutes?"
"(NL) No, Mr President, I have no comments regarding the content of the Minutes."
"You have indulged in a little parliamentary filibustering, but what is done is done, there is nothing we can do about it now."
"It will be recorded in the Minutes, of course."

"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Many Members are listed, but they will not all be able to speak."
"I shall have to be strict about speaking times and I would remind you that Members who have spoken in either, or both, of the previous two sittings will not have priority."
"Members that did not speak in either the sitting of 13 November or the sitting of 29 November will have priority."
"(SK) As soon as the Commission announced last October that the free movement of citizens from the new Member States would be postponed until 2009, we voiced our objections in the European Parliament."
"We also launched several initiatives, including questions to the Council and Commission, and we subsequently drafted Declaration No 72, which is still pending."
"This declaration is designed to ensure compliance with the original deadline for accession to the Schengen area."
"For this reason I regard the decision taken last week on St. Nicolas Day by EU interior ministers, enabling citizens from the nine new Member States to travel freely within the European Union from 1 January 2008, as a great success of the European Union and a consequence of the intervention by the MEPs."
"Colleagues, I would like to thank you for your support."
"I am convinced that all countries, including Slovakia, will soon agree upon the strict security requirements involved in temporarily deploying an enhanced version of the current system as proposed by Portugal."
"(EL) Mr President, last week Turkey made a 'Diplomatic move' by agreeing to open a port and an airport for trade with the Republic of Cyprus."
"Their timing was a bit odd, considering that their move was made during the COREPER meeting."
"However, the Turkish proposal is nothing more than a clumsy, unacceptable and provocative manoeuvre, whose sole objective is to bypass the obligations undertaken by Ankara towards the European Union and its Member States."
"Not only is Ankara persisting on essentially denying its obligations, but also is arrogantly setting conditions aimed at gaining favours in Cyprus."
"Turkey's obligations towards the European Union are very specific and are not subject to bargaining."
"Given these facts, the European Union should reject without further consideration these so called Turkish proposals."
"I believe that the European Union should unanimously reject this inappropriately provocative offer."
"(FR) Mr President, as I speak, the trial of Mr Vojislav Seselj, the chairman of Serbia's main party, the Serbian Radical Party, is getting under way."
"Mr Seselj surrendered voluntarily in January 2003, four years ago, when the indictment against him was published."
"The indictment referred only to speeches and a political plan to bring all Serbs together in a single country; that may be questionable of course, but we know what very painful circumstances that country has been through."
"Mr Seselj has been held in solitary confinement since December 2004 for granting interviews to Serbian newspapers, but the prosecutor, Mrs Uertz-Retzlaff, speaks against him in the press freely."
"Mr Seselj is demanding to see his family; he should be entitled to do so and to appear freely."
"He is demanding to correspond with the Tribunal in Serbian, his native language, which he is also entitled to do, but is being denied that right."
"As a doctor and professor of law, he wishes to conduct his own defence, which is a fundamental right."
"He is refusing to accept lawyers appointed by the tribunal, whom experience has shown to favour the prosecution."
"What does Alphons Orie, the presiding judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have to say about this?"
"I quote: the court finds that the accused's self-representation ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Igor Smirnov, who, 15 years ago seized power with the help of the Russian forces in Transnistria, had himself elected for another five years as the president of an illegitimate country."
"The dictator, who holds a Russian passport and was trained by the KGB, claimed 80% of the vote."
"The election was organised by an illegitimate government on territory controlled by foreign military forces; its result is null and void in terms of international law."
"The Smirnov regime will not be made any more legal by the permission given to three weak opponents to take part in a contest the result of which was known in advance, having been decided in Moscow during the summer."
"Smirnov's only serious rival, Mr Shevchuk, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of Transnistria, withdrew his candidacy at the urgent request of the Kremlin."
"The European Union must continue to support Moldova's territorial integrity."
"Our border assistance mission has proved successful where Russia's de facto veto has paralysed the OSCE's effectiveness."
"The greatest obstacle to the self-determination of the inhabitants of Transnistria is the presence of Russian forces."
"We must urgently demand their departure."
"(EL) Mr President, Article 49 of the European Union Treaty, which contains the accession clause to the European Union, specifies the role of the Union's institutions."
"According to the said article, the Council is the body which decides on negotiations."
"I direct two questions to this Body and the present European Commission: First, on what legal grounds does the European Commission carry out European Union accession negotiations with candidate countries on behalf of the European Union?"
"Second, is the European Commission authorised to express political opinions on critical issues for the selection or non-selection of a candidate country during interim, nonetheless, decisive stages of the negotiation procedure?"
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring to your attention the tragic development in the Middle East and the immediate need for swift and effective intervention."
"We need to stabilise the region or at least prevent any deterioration which would have unforeseen consequences."
"Europe is not absent from that region."
"It is present: with its diplomatic action, its development and humanitarian aid, its corporate relations in the Mediterranean and its participation in peace-keeping forces."
"However, it did not manage to play an effective role and so we must look into it immediately, because our hopes that military interventions will create a new Middle East with democracy and stability are not coming true."
"Therefore, we must look into a new intervention plan; moreover I believe that the European Parliament can promote the relevant talks, demanding results, which will positively affect the prosperity of both the people living in the region and ourselves of course, because whatever is happening in our neighbourhood should concern us."
"Mr President, I rise to speak because of my concern about the interference by Commissioner McCreevy in Irish politics last week, where he made a public statement challenging the Irish Government's policy with regard to health insurance on the Irish market."
"The area he is interfering in is not his responsibility: he has responsibility for the internal market, not for competition."
"In addition to that, the policy being pursued by the Government has been approved by the Commission and has recently been approved by the Irish courts."
"My only conclusion is that Commissioner McCreevy is assisting his former Cabinet colleague and friend, Minister Harney, in shifting her policy on health insurance and blaming Brussels for that shift in policy."
"That is an unacceptable direct interference by a Commissioner in Irish political decision-making."
"I would appeal to you, Mr President, to make those concerns known to President Barroso."
"I will pass on to you the correspondence I have had on that matter with the President and with Commissioner McCreevy."
"I shall communicate your points to Mr Barroso so that he can take the action he deems appropriate, Mr De Rossa."
"Mr President, I apologise for not being here when you first called me."
"A number of years ago, I, along with other Members of this Parliament, was involved when Europe provided funds for a study into having a ferry service between Ballycastle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, and Campbeltown in Scotland."
"The study was dutifully carried out, proved to be good, and the ferry service started and ran for a short time."
"The Scottish Parliament agreed to provide GBP 700 000, with the Northern Ireland Executive being prepared to provide GBP 300 000, making a total of GPB 1 million as a seedling grant to get the service up and going."
"Now we find that, while the Scottish Executive is prepared to honour its position and to pay the money up front, the direct-rule minister, Maria Eagle, is refusing to honour her side of the agreement."
"That is totally unacceptable and wrong."
"I have raised this with the Secretary of State and with Commissioner Barrot and I want to pursue it as far as possible."
"I see that the Irish bench is waking up."
"Mr President, I want to bring to the attention of the Commission - and, if possible, try to get a resolution about - a difficulty that Irish fishermen are facing at present because of an inflexible interpretation of the '100 kilometre rule', which means that fish must be landed and processed within a 100-kilometre range."
"The difficulty is that a lot of the processing capacity in Ireland is not exactly on the shore or on the docks, but further inland."
"This creates difficulties in terms of transportation, since road transport counts as part of the 100-kilometre range."
"I ask Commissioner Borg to look very carefully at that issue and give us a more flexible interpretation of the rule: both to allow what is a very successful Irish fishing industry to continue, and because it has an impact not only on Irish catches but also on the ability of other boats operating in Irish waters to land their catches in Ireland."
"This means they have to travel further, use more fuel, and are being forced to land their catches in other markets, which may not necessarily benefit the European Union as a whole."
"(PL) Mr President, Turkey is under the mistaken impression that last Thursday it took an important step towards continuing negotiations with the European Union."
"Opening one single airport and one single port to Greek Cypriots for a year is a joke and yet another example of Prime Minister Erdogan's arrogant attitude towards Europe."
"Turkey is behaving as if the Union were wanting to join Turkey."
"In fact it is the other way around, Turkey is asking to join the Union."
"If Turkey is doing the asking, it must be because it considers our European civilisation based mainly on Christianity to be superior to its own, or at least to be in some way desirable."
"That being the case, Turkey should comply with our conditions and not impose its own."
"Given this state of affairs, something more than partial suspension of accession negotiations with Turkey is needed."
"The negotiations should be completely halted."
"Mr President, I rise to draw attention to the continuing plight of the West Papuan people."
"Just a week or so ago was West Papua Independence Day, which is traditionally held on 1 December to mark the anniversary of the Dutch promise to grant independence to West Papua, a promise originally made in December 1961."
"Of course, that independence never came and instead there has been a continuing military occupation by Indonesia for over 40 years, with torture, disappearance, detention without trial and murder of West Papuans at the hands of the military being commonplace."
"I am calling on you, President, as well as the Commission and Council, to raise the issue of West Papua's self-determination with the relevant Indonesian authorities, and for them to do all they can to ensure the withdrawal of the Indonesian military from West Papua and the holding of a free and democratic referendum on self-determination, including all the indigenous West Papuans."
"A number of colleagues have put down a written declaration for this session to coincide with Independence Day for West Papua, and I urge my colleagues here to co-sign that written declaration."
"Mr President, as colleagues may be aware, the Irish peace process is continuing to inch forward towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including the restoration of the power-sharing and all-Ireland institutions."
"The significance of the DUP's Ian Paisley's conditional 'yes' to power-sharing with Irish nationalists and republicans should not be underestimated."
"However, there is still a long way to go and many challenges lie ahead."
"It is now important that we get down to the very serious business of re-establishing the political institutions so that local people can make local decisions, free from interference from unelected and unaccountable British Government ministers."
"It is also important that the DUP begin the process of engagement with Sinn Féin to resolve other outstanding issues, including that of policing."
"I would encourage the EU to continue to show support for the process at this crucial time."
"(PL) Mr President, 25 years ago, on 13 December 1981, martial law was imposed in Poland."
"This led to the outlawing of the Solidarity trade union."
"Essentially, martial law involved the use of force, repression and persecution against trade union activists, scientists, artists and indeed all those who refused to be enslaved by totalitarianism in Poland."
"Under martial law, when Poland was ruled by General Jaruzelski, violations of human, civil and political rights were commonplace."
"Over ten thousand individuals were either imprisoned or sent to internment camps during that period."
"Many people laid down their lives in defence of Solidarity."
"On 16 December, nine miners were killed as a result of the brutal dispersal of demonstrators at the Wujek mine by special units of the ZOMO Motorised Reserves of the Citizens Militia, and 21 others were injured."
"I call on the European Parliament to pay tribute today to all those who fell in the cause of freedom and justice."
"I refer to all the victims of persecution under martial law and to all those who refused to be subdued by the use of force and continued their independent activity, thus contributing to the advent of freedom and democracy in Poland."
"Mr President, my constituent David Wilson was jailed in 2003 because illegal migrants had hidden in the back of his lorry at a Greek port."
"He was charged and sentenced within 24 hours under a fast-track procedure, without sufficient legal advice, with a local shopkeeper as an interpreter, and without advice from the British Embassy."
"As he was totally innocent he was acquitted on appeal, but not before suffering the horrendous ordeal of months in prison far from his family and the permanent loss of his job."
"He never recovered from that and tragically took his own life last month."
"That tragedy would never have happened if the EU's framework decision on procedural rights and criminal proceedings for people charged in other Member States had already been in force."
"That proposal would guarantee that anyone facing criminal charges abroad has access to their country's consular services and is given qualified legal advice."
"That was all lacking in his case."
"I would urge the Council to get a move on and adopt that proposal as a matter of urgency."
"(FR) Mr President, I want to express my disapproval at what Mr Kyprianou, European Commissioner responsible for health and consumer protection, said at a press conference on 9 November."
"The Commissioner warmly congratulated four food-sector multinationals - which I will not name - on what they are doing to help fight obesity; he also allowed them to promote themselves by setting up stands at the entrance to the room where the press conference was held."
"We must bear in mind that one child in five in Europe is obese and that this number is growing every year because of poor eating habits encouraged by the fast food, fizzy drinks and chocolate bars marketed mainly by those four multinationals."
"Binding legislation to provide European consumers with nutritional information would do them more good than eulogies addressed to companies that have contributed to the obesity explosion for decades."
"There are other ways of fighting obesity: eating more fruit and vegetables and taking part in sporting activities, which ought to be better promoted."
"I can therefore only advise Mr Kyprianou to get together with his fellow Commissioner Mrs Fischer-Boel to assist in reforming the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables in the interests of a healthy and balanced diet."
"Mr President, comparing your recent statements on visits to Italy and Ireland, confusion has arisen over your position on the Constitutional Treaty."
"Addressing the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate on 9 November 2006, you stated that there appear to be four possible scenarios for the Constitutional Treaty: retaining the text with an addition here or there; salvaging the main elements and drafting a shorter Treaty; re-opening negotiations on certain points; or abandoning the Treaty and waiting for a better time to renegotiate it."
"You also stated categorically that there is no doubt that the text will not be implemented as it stands."
"Yet, at Dublin Castle on 30 November, you urged Ireland to ratify the current text of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Surely this will be a pointless exercise if, as you said in Italy, there is no chance of the current text being implemented!"
"Mr President, you leave yourself open, at best, to the accusation of sending out mixed messages or of tailoring your message to suit the audience you are addressing."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we have the right to be informed of the clear position of our President on this most important of issues."
"As a representative of a small Member State, I feel particularly strongly that all Member States should be involved in the reflection process."
"I do not want to see a situation where the larger Member States, such as Italy, are consulted and decide on the future of the Constitution - and indeed Europe - while the smaller Member States are simply told to ratify the text as presented to them."
"I would love to hear your views on this, Mr President."
"Thank you very much."
"I believe that it was made very clear during an interesting debate that took place in Ireland, which you were unable to attend, for very important reasons I am sure."
"I am talking about the European Forum on Ireland, at which I had the opportunity to reply to questions similar to yours."
"I believe that it was made very clear and that all of the Members in attendance understood, but we all know that it is very difficult to get people who do not want to understand to understand."
"I said to the European Council on several occasions on behalf of the European Parliament that every country should try to ratify the Treaty."
"That is the European Parliament's position: to call upon all of the governments to try to ratify the Treaty."
"As far as I know, that is also your group's position, as its leader has often explained."
"That, and only that, is what I have said: that every country must try to ratify the Treaty."
"Are you still in any doubt, Mrs Doyle?"
"(PT) As the Commission is aware, the air transport service on the Atlantic islands of Madeira and Porto Santo is a public service, with the Portuguese Government subsidising the company that exclusively runs the service."
"Recently, however, ticket prices for flights between these islands and the Portuguese mainland rose dramatically, on account of the increase in the price of oil."
"This decision by the Portuguese Government is, in our view, a questionable one, as it runs counter to the spirit of the Council regulation governing this form of public service obligation, which is why I have brought the matter to Parliament's attention."
"How come passengers on these flights are being made to pay for the increase in the price of fuel, thereby hampering their mobility, especially now that the price of oil is falling and the euro is becoming stronger?"
"What is more, the Portuguese Government and the Community bodies know that passengers on Madeira and Porto Santo have no alternative sea link with the mainland."
"This is ample reason for Parliament and the Commission to look into and monitor this measure, which penalises the citizens of one of the EU's outermost regions."
"We should like this matter to be clarified and the situation changed, which is why we have brought it to the Commissioner's attention."
"Mr President, I seek your assistance."
"On 17 October I tabled a priority written question to the Commission on the subject of animal testing under REACH."
"I did not ask the question for the good of my health; I asked it so that we could have information, before the vote this coming week, about the number of animals likely to die as a result of the REACH testing process."
"I should have had a reply, I believe, by 18 November."
"I am told that it is held up somehow in the Commission's services, which some might regard as convenient for the Commission and an exercise in news management."
"These figures are likely to be distressing to those concerned about the testing of animals."
"I would seek your assistance in obtaining a response to that question before Wednesday's vote."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 2 May 2006, Canada's annual budget was introduced to Parliament, which recommends 100% tax reduction on all Canadian produced wines and beers."
"This budget is under discussion."
"However, such a budget will create unfair competition to European Union wines and beers."
"This goes against WTO principles."
"Exports to Canada are of particular importance to the European Union."
"In particular, in 2005 the European Union exported wines worth EUR 446 million and beers worth EUR 110 million."
"The Commission must assume an active role and take the necessary actions to force the Canadian Government to implement its commitments to the WTO."
"We have always adhered to the commitments we have made to the World Trade Organisation."
"The other nations should do the same."
"(ES) Mr President, on 2 July, more than five months ago now, the presidential elections were held in Mexico."
"As you all know, the winner was Felipe Calderón, the current Mexican President."
"Since those elections, the opposition candidate of the Left, López Obrador, has failed to acknowledge or accept his defeat and, worse still, the Left has tried to sabotage President Calderón's inauguration and is still threatening the legitimate government and instigating disturbances, demonstrations and sabotage against it."
"I therefore wish to condemn this anti-democratic attitude on the part of the Left led by Mr López Obrador and I also wish to condemn the Mexican Left's unprecedented and unjustifiable boycott."
"The European institutions cannot look the other way, and this European Parliament in particular must support President Calderón's legitimate government in Mexico."
"We in this Parliament must take initiatives to ensure that democracy is respected in Mexico and that the Left acknowledge its defeat and form a democratic and constructive opposition rather than an anti-democratic opposition."
"(SK) I welcomed the report in which the US President, George Bush, announced that he would seek to relax visa requirements for the new EU Member States of Central Europe."
"President Bush's decision to launch this programme is, among other things, a result of long-term pressure exerted by the new Member States."
"Their leaders took every opportunity to remind President Bush of the fact that they would like to see the visa requirements simplified or cancelled altogether, thus, enabling their citizens to travel to the USA under the visa waiver programme, just like the nationals of western European countries."
"Regarding Slovakia, it should be pointed out that, as a result of reforms conducted by the government of Mikuláš Dzurinda, the country has made substantial economic progress."
"There are no longer such pressing economic reasons for Slovaks to violate their visa status and immigrate illegally to the USA."
"The facilitation of travel and the cancellation of visa requirements for citizens of the new Member States will have to be accompanied by, among other things, compliance with new, stricter, security requirements."
"I believe that President Bush will manage to persuade Congress to accept this programme."
"(PL) Mr President, much has been said in this Chamber about achieving the Lisbon objectives and enabling the European Union to compete with the largest economies in the world such as those of the United States, China or India."
"Our discussions have still not had any practical impact, however, and our dreams of high economic growth may never come true as there may be nobody around to help achieve the desired growth."
"According to a recent UN report, by 2050 there will be one hundred million fewer European citizens than there are today."
"Few children are being born, European society is ageing, and an ever-smaller number of workers is supporting an ever-increasing number of pensioners."
"The Lisbon objectives must go hand in hand with an appropriate demographic policy for the Union."
"Such a policy could perhaps be modelled on the measures taken by Finland, France and Latvia."
"These countries are currently experiencing a baby boom, due to the provision of appropriate incentives and facilities for parents who wish to have children but also wish to be able to support them, and who have been enabled to combine their parental responsibilities with paid employment."
"Europe must look to the quality and quantity of its workforce if it is to achieve economic growth."
"It is therefore vital to develop a Community policy for the development of European society, encompassing both the demographic aspect and the immigration of qualified workers from outside the Union."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot of talk lately on whether Brussels or Strasbourg should be the seat of the European Parliament and the European Union."
"Both of these are wrong."
"The seat of Europe should be in the city where decisions are taken, and lately the decisions regarding the European Union's future are being taken in Ankara."
"This is the truth."
"When great countries, such as England were joining Europe, the terms were set by Europe."
"Nowadays, Turkey is the one setting the terms to Europe in order for Turkey to join."
"This is unacceptable."
"Turkey does not recognise the 25th state, wants one port, then two ports and all of us are just watching, passively."
"When shall we finally understand that this policy supports Ankara's arrogance?"
"Can we not understand that this is a rotten apple even before it joins?"
"Just imagine how things will be when, tomorrow morning, Erdogan's Turkey joins Europe with our vote."
"Then Turkey will just push us aside from day one."
"(PL) Mr President, the Seventh Congress of the Party of European Socialists was held in Porto from 7-9 December, under the slogan 'A New Social Europe'."
"Many key issues for the future of Europe and the European Union were raised during the congress."
"It was recognised that the provision of appropriate and accessible child care was a priority matter, so as to allow young parents to continue in paid employment."
"Investing in our children's future is an investment in our own future."
"A great many documents were adopted. Chief amongst them were a resolution laying down ten principles for a New Social Europe, a resolution on the Middle East, a resolution on Belarus and a resolution on a new social democratic energy policy."
"The latter seems to me to be entirely relevant and particularly important because of Europe's increasing dependence on a small number of suppliers of sources of energy."
"Mr President, this congress proved once again that the Socialists are the most important political force in Europe."
"It is they who are the driving force working to secure Europe's future."
"(PL) Mr President, 25 years ago, on the night of 12 December, martial law was imposed in Poland."
"Tanks rolled onto the streets, the nation was deprived of its freedom, and innocent Poles were beaten and killed."
"All this was done by people in authority who were convinced that they knew better than the nation itself what the nation needed."
"They believed that maintaining an alliance with a foreign regime or rather, remaining subservient to it, took precedence over the will of the people."
"Essentially, what they were concerned about was hanging on to power and all the benefits deriving from it."
"These evil individuals were supported by foreigners pursuing their own imperialist ambitions at the expense of an enslaved nation."
"I trust the anniversary of this event will be an occasion for Europe to examine its conscience."
"Do we really believe that there are no self-styled sages amongst us who think they know what other nations need better than those nations themselves?"
"Is it not the case that leaders still reach agreements detrimental to the good of their countries and that the desire for leadership and its associated benefits often takes priority over the good of the nations politicians are meant to serve?"
"The life, freedom and dignity of every individual must be sacrosanct for us."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a European citizen and a European politician, there are two things that bother me."
"The first is the fact of structural deficiencies in the European Union's energy policy, of the consequences of which we were once more reminded as recently as the beginning of November."
"Secondly, there is the quality of Europe's relations with Russia."
"It is quite obviously negligent to deny our current dependence on energy providers that are not merely foreign but owned by foreign states."
"The sad fact is that the next thing to happen is that economic and political interests merge and start to influence what happens on the political level playing field."
"We make the claim to adhere, in all our dealings, to the principle that European values must never take second place to economic interests, and that principle is a core element in our Community."
"In our dealings with Russia, the expectation of our dialogues on energy being fruitful must not be contingent on our keeping silent about our misgivings concerning the violations of human rights and of freedom of the press."
"What must be quite clear to us is that either there will be a Europe founded upon values, or there will soon be no Europe left."
"(PL) Mr President, this is a British Airways frequent flyer card."
"I tried to do something with it when recently 100 Members of the British House of Commons protested in connection with the discriminatory treatment meted out to a British Airways employee wearing a small cross."
"In my view, action of this kind is unacceptable in Europe, which is founded on a Christian heritage dating back centuries."
"I would therefore like to express my solidarity with all our British fellow Members and with all the British politicians and journalists protesting against this situation."
"Mr President, F-type isolation prisons for political detainees were introduced in Turkey at the end of 2000 with the aim of psychologically breaking, and subsequently re-educating, the prisoners."
"In the last 6 years, 28 people have been killed, 122 have died on hunger strike and there have been thousands of protests from within, as well outside, Turkey."
"Mr Behiç Aşçı, an Istanbul lawyer representing F-type prisoners, has been on hunger strike for 251 days."
"Mr President, you yourself, much to your credit, took some protest actions a few weeks ago, but the Turkish authorities have been stubbornly deaf."
"Mr Aşçı is now very near to death."
"I plead with you to communicate directly and urgently with the Turkish Prime Minister and request that he deal with the case of Mr Aşçı personally in a last effort to save the life of a European-minded Turkish idealist."
"Mr President, this summer the Russian State Duma introduced two laws allowing action to be taken against Russian and non-Russian citizens abroad."
"Authorised by a decision of the President of the Russian Federation, euphemistically named 'special assignment units' of the federal security services may be used against so-called terrorists or those who have allegedly libelled the state."
"Those laws are a licence to kill, and the first public execution of a British citizen was carried out last month when Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned and died in London."
"However, the murder was bungled and a radioactive evidence trail stretches from London to Moscow."
"Tony Blair's reaction was to say that nothing must come between Britain's relations with Russia."
"The Russians' reaction was to say that no suspect, whatever the evidence, will be extradited to Britain."
"But the reaction of the world must be to exclude Russia from the civilised community of nations until its international murder squads are no longer operational."
"(EL) Mr President, today is the only day suitable for my speech."
"Today, 11 December, marks 60 years from the foundation of Unicef and we are celebrating the International Children's Day."
"The Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child have been signed - even though some states have not yet signed - and the Commission has already presented its Strategy on the Rights of the Child on a European level."
"Therefore, we hope for coordinated action throughout the European Union's external and internal policies, and an effort from every Member State for the protection of the rights of the child, which from what we see is not only threatened by poverty, illiteracy and armed conflicts in countries outside the Union, but is equally in danger within our own civilised countries from malicious attacks by people who do not have collective responsibility."
"(FR) Mr President, on 22 June 2006 the Commission presented a communication in response to the crisis of overproduction in the European winegrowing sector, recommending the grubbing-up of 400 000 hectares of vines in the next five years, that is, almost 12% of the European Union's 3.4 million hectares."
"I want to draw your attention today to the existence of illegal vine plantations in Europe, which are thought to cover an area of 150 000 hectares in the European Union as a whole."
"According to the Commission's own figures in a March 2004 report, these illegal vine plantations are equivalent to an output of 5 to 8 million hectolitres at a time when European overproduction is put at 12 million hectolitres."
"The permanent grubbing-up of these illegal vines would allow a measure of balance to be restored."
"Before any decision on grubbing-up is taken, I therefore call on the Commission to determine the precise scale of these illegal plantations."
"(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most important item on the European Union agenda is still energy security and the common energy policy."
"However, the formulation and implementation of such a policy is a long-term project."
"Germany and Russia have entered into a bilateral agreement to lay a gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, a pipeline that is anything but safe from an ecological viewpoint, bearing in mind the debris from World War II on the sea bed which threatens the Baltic States with dreadful consequences."
"In the meantime, the EU is demanding that safe, modernised atomic energy reactors be closed."
"Scientists estimate that by the year 2010 there will be a shortage of 3.5 billion kilowatts of electrical energy in the Baltic region."
"Where will we get it, how much will we pay for it and will we feel safe?"
"Has anyone calculated to what extent the shortage of electrical energy will affect EU competitiveness?"
"I invite all Member States, after considering the changes in the energy market, to support Lithuania's application of Article 37 of the Treaty of Accession to the EU in considering the possibility of extending the operational life of the Ignalina Atomic Energy Plant."
"Mr President, I hope you had time to enjoy some hill walking while you were in Ireland."
"One of the issues you may not have been aware of during your visit is the deep unease in the countryside about how the Commission is applying on-farm inspections in relation to the common agricultural policy and cross-compliance."
"There is a huge gap between what the Commission says it is doing in relation to simplification initiatives and what is happening on the ground in relation to cross-compliance inspections."
"The checklist with which farmers are required to comply is very long and confusing."
"Allied to that, there is real fear that if you breach one of these regulations, you will face a penalty on your payment."
"Consumers deserve to know that farmers meet high standards of food safety and production; but I would ask whether these unannounced spot-checks of the detailed sort I have outlined are the way to meet that objective."
"The Irish Government itself is to blame for the long delay in implementing the Nitrates Directive, with the result that we are now forced to have all the on-farm inspections catapulted into the latter end of 2006."
"Could I ask the Commission to specify exactly what it wants from farmers, and to ensure that all Member States are complying with the rules?"
"(LT) I would like to draw your attention to the work of our fine translators, to the quality of their work."
"Lately one hears many discontented voices saying that the quality of translations is declining."
"You are no doubt aware, Mr President, that we allot large sums of money for translations and we rightly take pride in the possibility of speaking various languages in European institutions."
"I think that one of the problems causing an increase in the amount of complaints about the quality of translations is the fact that in our Parliament the translation quality control system is not appropriately set up and does not function adequately."
"Indeed, the quality of translations is usually checked by colleagues, that is, they check each other's work, which is probably not very objective."
"Queries from Members of Parliament are not often responded to by Translation Service staff."
"At least I have never received any replies."
"I hope that the Parliamentary Bureau will bring this to their attention."
"(PL) Mr President, we should remain constantly alert to the situation beyond Europe's Eastern border, that is to say, in Russia and Ukraine."
"We have focused a great deal of attention on negotiations with Russia recently, but I urge the House not to neglect events in Ukraine."
"I would like the House to send out a clear message that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and support its progress towards democracy."
"In other words, we do not wish anti-democratic processes to develop and gather strength."
"Ukraine is a large neighbour of ours and we have an interest in it."
"It must not be sidelined."
"Accordingly, I believe that every message sent out by this House or by members of other institutions to the Government of Ukraine and, in particular, to Ukrainian society is extremely important."
"(PL) Mr President, next year we shall celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome."
"I believe that this will provide an ideal opportunity for considered reflection and debate on the future of the European Union."
"As we recall the fundamental principles underpinning the concept of integration we should be able to find the answer to key questions such as where Europe is headed and what the possibilities for future enlargement are."
"Our policy towards the Balkan states, Ukraine, Turkey and also Georgia and Moldova needs to be clearly defined."
"The Union should cooperate more closely with these countries and provide stronger support for the changes taking place within them."
"The most important issue we have to deal with at present is internal reform of the Union, which involves strengthening the role of the European Parliament and improving the decision-making system."
"During the next six months under German Presidency we should also work on a solution to the future of the Constitutional Treaty and the issue of energy security."
"Well, that is the last word and it is also the last time that I will have the honour of presiding over the one-minute speeches."
"That is why we have been more generous with speaking time, and I would ask the Commission and the Council for their understanding."
"I thank you for your patience, but during the final moments of the party there is a free bar, and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to those people who have wished to speak on previous occasions but have not been able to."
"That concludes this item."
"European Chemicals Agency - Amendment of Directive 67/548/EEC on dangerous substances (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the recommendation for second reading, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC [07524/8/2006 C6-0267/2006 (Rapporteur: Guido Sacconi), and"
"the recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances in order to adapt it to Regulation (EC) No .../2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and establishing a European Chemicals Agency [07525/3/2006 C6-0268/2006 (Rapporteur: Guido Sacconi)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the days since we reached our understanding with the Council - which was made possible in part by the Commission's support - I have been wondering what might be an appropriate comparison for this long journey, which, for me, has lasted three and a half years, and which has brought us to this point."
"To answer that question, I have had to resort to my passion for mountain climbing: perhaps the most fitting comparison is to say that we have climbed a high mountain - probably, and without any exaggeration, an 8 000-metre peak in the Himalayas."
"I have never been that high and I doubt if I ever will, because I am only a moderate climber, but I do know what happens when you reach the top: at that point the exhaustion and the dangers you have experienced no longer count, nor, perhaps, does the disappointment you often feel when you get to the top and the view is restricted because of mist."
"It has happened to me so many times: I get up there and I cannot see a thing!"
"Nevertheless, the sense of achievement is enormous just the same."
"It is important to be quite clear about two things: the first is to realise whether you have actually got to the top, and the second is to prepare properly for the descent, which is often no easier than the climb up."
"As the lead climber, I should like to give my opinion on these two points."
"Have we actually got to the top?"
"I really think we have."
"We have done so with the package of chapters that we agreed upon in the final stage of the negotiations: duty of care; animal welfare and, above all, the compulsory promotion of alternatives to animal testing; the agency; communication of information; and adjustment to the new interinstitutional agreement on comitology, thus safeguarding Parliament's role."
"We have had to give up one thing, which is extending the chemical safety report to small tonnages; that, however, was not a victim of this ascent, but rather an early retreat to base camp, since we have established a review clause that may possibly allow us to reintroduce this obligation in seven years' time, once appropriate checks have been performed along the whole supply chain."
"The reason why I can say that we have reached the top is that, with this agreement, we have above all arrived at a successful solution to that most controversial topic, the purpose of REACH, which is to regulate the substances of highest concern by means of the authorisation procedure."
"To check whether we really have got to the top, we have to remember where we started from: a deep and very distant valley."
"The Commission's original proposal in fact stated that all substances subject to authorisation could be authorised on the basis of the principle of adequate control."
"We have come a long way since then."
"The Council's common position, which was positively influenced by Parliament, had already cut back the range of these substances, and then, with the 30 November agreement, we took a further step forwards and reduced the number of substances that could be approved under this quicker and easier procedure and, on top of that, we included all substances - even those that will be authorised on the basis of adequate control - in a substitution process."
"Where an alternative exists, a substitution plan must necessarily be submitted; if no alternatives exist at the time of authorisation, the company must in all cases declare the lines of research and development that it intends to pursue."
"On this basis, therefore, the duration of the authorisation will be established case by case, and it must be duly justified by the Commission where an alternative exists."
"If an alternative should appear during the term of the authorisation, the obligation to submit a substitution plan will come into effect."
"What I should like to emphasise is that the Commission will make its decisions case by case on the basis of the agency's report, which must take account of the opinions of the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis and the Committee for Risk Assessment, which must also take account of third-party contributions."
"It is therefore a highly transparent process that does not depend solely on the applicant's own declarations."
"As for the descent from the summit, I think it is important to choose the best route, since the same grade of climbing difficulty may be a much greater challenge on the way down than on the ascent."
"What I mean by this metaphor is that we should adopt the compromise that we have reached, because in that way we can have the regulation published by the end of the year and thus meet the deadline for starting the process to implement REACH by 1 June 2007."
"This is a complex issue, which cannot be resolved by rushing it through: REACH is so complicated that it would be wrong to expect to solve all the problems at the approval stage."
"The important thing now is to start implementing it: we have provided for a number of what we might call self-regulating mechanisms and deadlines, which will allow for adjustments to be made as work progresses, on the basis of the practical experience that we have gained."
"We have been improving the balance at all stages in this procedure: I could mention the solutions we have found for the problems of small enterprises, or the strengthened health and environmental protection measures, particularly as regards the risks to which workers are exposed."
"Overall, I think we can be very pleased with this end product."
"I have noticed that my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have tabled a package of amendments, which are on the whole admirable and are very similar to those that I tabled during the negotiations with the Council and the Commission in order to arrive at the point where we are now."
"How useful are these amendments?"
"Where will they take us?"
"Which peak will we be able to reach in an unlikely conciliation procedure?"
"We all know what the real alternatives are: either to adopt the compromise package that we have set out, improving on the common position, or in fact to accept the common position."
"Let us be quite open about this: maybe that would be better."
"These are the real alternatives that we have, and I am sure that Parliament will make the right choice in Wednesday's vote."
"Mr President, my speech today means that my work is done."
"Even the voting list will be short - there is not a lot to do, just two pages, which is a record for REACH, considering that some 5 000 amendments were examined at first reading."
"My work therefore finishes here, and it just remains for me to thank all those who, in their many different ways, have taken part in this Himalayan expedition."
"A great many have taken part: I have known six presidencies and countless committee chairmen and commissioners, and I was always there as the lead climber, even though there were times when someone tried to pull me down instead of acting as my safety person."
"Even so, we have got this far."
"Joking apart, I am grateful to everyone, from the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Florenz, to all the shadow rapporteurs, including those who have voiced their disagreement with this result, to the presidencies, especially the Finnish Presidency, which has really been a crucial interlocutor, to the Commission, which may not have imparted any great bursts of speed but which played a decisive role in the final stages to achieve this result."
"Above all, however, I thank the staff who have worked with me: two Italian ladies - one of whom is my assistant, Sabina Magnano - who have played a very important role in this project."
"If I could change the name of the report, I would name it after them and all those who have worked with me."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sacconi, the Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is one of the most significant legislative projects in the EU's history."
"It will be a giant leap forward from the current control system for chemicals, which is roughly 40 years old."
"It will make Europe a global pioneer and forerunner in this area."
"For almost exactly three years, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been working painstakingly together to have the REACH Regulation adopted."
"The negotiating process has seen difficult phases."
"It is with no exaggeration that I can say that, but for the keen commitment of all parties to this, we would not be here today."
"The drafting of the Regulation by the Council has been a challenge for no fewer than seven presidencies."
"I would like to thank all the presidencies that have prepared a basis in the Council for the decision that is now before us. The political consensus achieved in the Council during the UK Presidency paved the way excellently for the conclusion of talks during the Finnish presidential term."
"I am very pleased that the Member States have given their staunch support to the negotiated compromise package."
"I also sincerely hope that the various groups in the European Parliament will support the compromise solution as broadly as possible in the vote on Wednesday."
"I would, in this connection, like to thank the European Parliament for their splendid levels of cooperation during the autumn negotiations."
"In particular, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and numerous other Members, who have been actively involved in finding common solutions."
"I also want to thank Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas, whose personal input in the talks was considerable."
"At this stage it is a good time to evaluate the process regarding how the objectives set for the REACH Regulation are to be realised overall."
"The regulation will do much to improve the protection of human health and the environment."
"The REACH system will improve our knowledge of the properties of substances, make the control of risks from chemicals more effective, and make it necessary to have an authorisation to use the most hazardous substances of all."
"The new safety requirements will be the most stringent in the world."
"It is in the common interests of European consumers and industry alike to promote the product development of new and safer chemicals."
"It is for this purpose that the current notification procedure has been reworked in the proposal."
"The REACH system will also mean that companies will have greater responsibility and more duties to discharge, and it will present companies with an opportunity to attend to their obligations under chemical safety more independently than they used to."
"There will be a significant increase in the transparency of the control of chemicals with the creation of up-to-date information systems and registers for the European Chemicals Agency, from which the public too will be able to obtain information on substances and their properties more easily."
"There will be no other information systems of the kind in the world."
"If the effects of substances are to be examined properly better information on their properties will be needed."
"The REACH Regulation will put this on a new level by making it possible to use alternative research methods and programmes on a broad basis."
"These new research methods are also likely to influence chemicals testing at global level."
"Consumers too will be able to obtain more information on the hazardous substances contained in goods and articles."
"With REACH a system will also be established which will oblige businesses to give details, if so requested by consumers, on substances of high concern contained in articles."
"The matter of the authorisation procedure and substitutions were the last questions that remained unanswered in the negotiations."
"The Presidency's proposal is that the applicant or holder of an authorisation should submit a substitution plan, while an analysis of the alternatives shows that there are suitable alternative options."
"The substitution plan should be submitted regardless of whether the authorisation is to be granted on the basis of appropriate risk management or socio-economic benefits."
"What is more, the appropriate risk management route was made narrower in scope than the version in the common position adopted, in that it will not apply to PBT or vPvB substances."
"With regard to substances that interfere with hormone function, it was agreed that this should be looked at again within the next six years."
"I believe that this solution takes balanced and realistic account of the concerns voiced by the European Parliament about the most hazardous substances being substituted."
"It is with pleasure that the Finnish Presidency can confirm that there is a package of amendments to be voted on which is based on the outcome of the tripartite negotiations."
"I can also confirm the Council's approval of these amendments."
"Regarding other amendments, I hope that the outcome of the talks will remain unchanged."
"I hope that at its sitting on Wednesday Parliament will adopt the compromise package on the Regulation as negotiated with the Council."
"Then a legislative project of importance both to the public and industry would be one major step closer to its realisation."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate marks the last stage on a long road, a road leading ultimately to a great leap forward for health, for the environment, and - let me specifically add - for the competitiveness of European industry."
"I do indeed hope that this great project will set standards for the whole world in terms of environmental and health policy."
"We owe our having got so far not least to your House's great dedication and influence, and we are particularly indebted to Mr Sacconi, who has shown himself to be a great negotiator and to have a tremendous knowledge of the subject."
"I would also like to thank Mr Florenz, the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who has guided us through the trilogue, which was an extremely difficult and sometimes laborious process, as well as Mrs Ek, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for her valuable contribution and Mr Nassauer, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection; both of them played a key role."
"Your House has left its unmistakable mark on the results put before us today, and I would be the first to say that they represent an improvement over that which went before."
"That has mainly been accomplished through the strengthening of the approval systems and the offering of bigger incentives for the replacement of those substances for which suitable alternatives exist."
"I should also like to reiterate that the use of substitutes for substances where suitable alternatives are available is economically advantageous."
"Doing so is not to our detriment but to our benefit."
"I am also very happy to see that it has proved possible, in the course of deliberations, to take greater account of the need to protect animals, for one of the aspects of REACH that I really did find problematic was that it would lead to much more use being made of tests on animals, when quite enough of this is being done already, but I can here and now take up Mr Davies' question from the previous debate and say that the way in which REACH will be implemented will certainly be determined by the end objective of bringing about a really substantial reduction in experiments on animals."
"We have improved the information with which consumers are provided, while your House was, at the same time, aware of the need for consideration to be given to the concerns and interests of those on the other side, namely the hundreds and thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that will be obliged to apply REACH."
"The belief that REACH would be a problem for large-scale industry in Europe was always a misconception, albeit one propagated by some environmental organisations."
"European heavy industry has no problem whatever with REACH, whether with the form in which it was produced then, or with the form in which it exists now, but it has always been problematic for small and medium-sized enterprises, whose ability to compete - indeed, whose ability to survive at all - will be jeopardised if we are not very careful indeed to consider what they can take and what not."
"It is for that reason that the changes made are extremely significant, not only as regards the verification requirements for substances produced in small quantities, but also the enhanced incentives for the shared use of data for the purposes of registration and the improved protection of intellectual property rights."
"The Commission believes that a balance between competitiveness on the one hand and necessary advances on the health and environment front, on the other, has been achieved, and it is for that reason that it endorses the proposal that is before you today."
"It follows that the Commission also endorses the amendments on which Mr Sacconi's proposal is based."
"Permit me to conclude by saying that there is something else on which I am in agreement with Mr Sacconi."
"We may well be about to achieve our objective, that being the adoption of this law, but that does not mean - far from it, indeed - that the difficulties have been overcome; it may well be that we have yet to come up against most of them, for this will be an act, the implementation of which will still demand a great deal of attention, creativity and energy."
"I would like to point out that we now have to ensure that the Agency in Helsinki is got up and running without delay, and the main problem with that has to do with the processing of data."
"It must be ensured that the implementing regulations are brought into effect soon and that the parties affected should be made aware without delay of what they have to do; above all, we have to ensure that those who will have to be guided by REACH know how this is to work in practice."
"The Commission has already started to do more to prepare small and medium-sized enterprises by supplying them with more extensive information, so that they know just what is going to happen."
"Ultimately - since what we are dealing with here is a directive - we must take care that no new problems and complications result from it being implemented in different ways in different Member States, and I ask for your House's help also in that which now has to be done."
"If we continue to work together on this in future, I am convinced that we will surely succeed in creating a model for the realisation of our European concept, combining a strong, high-performing and job-maintaining industrial base with high standards - the highest possible standards for the environment and the health of our fellow citizens."
"Member of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a long-term legislative procedure is reaching its completion and REACH is taking its final form."
"The Commission, as mentioned by the Vice-President Mr Verheugen, congratulates the Council and Parliament on reaching an agreement."
"With this agreement we will achieve better health and environmental protection as well as promotion of industrial innovation and competitiveness."
"The Commission supports this set of compromise proposals that were agreed between the Council and Parliament on 30 November 2006."
"I would like to thank the Presidency and Minister Mr Pekkarinen, and of course the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and its president Mr Florenz, and especially its rapporteur Mr Guido Sacconi, for their significant efforts and determination, because of which this proposal had a happy end."
"REACH is one of the most comprehensive, inspired and ambitious legislations that have been drafted in the European Union, so far."
"It will affect all industry sectors, but also simple citizens in direct or indirect ways considering that chemical products are so widespread in everyday life."
"For citizens and consumers, REACH means better information regarding the substances contained in everyday products, but foremost it means that the dangerous substances will be gradually replaced by safer ones."
"Moreover, risk assessments will take into consideration vulnerable groups, such as children, pregnant women and the elderly."
"Therefore, citizens' health will improve and environmental damage will be avoided which not only cost a lot to be rectified and managed, but in many cases cannot be restored."
"REACH signifies broad responsibility on the part of industry to prevent adverse effects to health and the environment from the production, use and sale of chemical products."
"Furthermore, it means that the flow of information to the production chain will be improved so that future users will have better and full knowledge regarding the features and properties of the substances they use."
"Therefore, it will be possible to specify more precise objectives for risk management measures, a prospect that will boost workforce protection and reduce health and business problems."
"Even though there will be some increase in cost, this expenditure and investment will be distributed over a long-term period, that is, 11 years in the event of registration or longer in the event of a loan."
"With the new system, we expect to regain consumer confidence in chemical products and the chemical industry, and moreover REACH will boost competition and innovation, a fact that will both offset and cover the larger part of the initial expenses and investments."
"REACH aims at reducing animal testing to a bare minimum."
"The agreement between Parliament and the Council on this point is satisfactory."
"It emphasises the importance of alternative methods and provides for a 45-day period for public consultation on each test proposal."
"Wednesday's vote will be the final stage of a procedure that aims at achieving the goal set out by the Heads of State or Government during the 2006 Spring Convention, namely the completion of REACH by the end of 2006."
"I hope that we complete the procedure as planned, and the regulation is put into effect so that we can begin to face this big challenge, namely to gradually collect information on thousands of substances that are being used today and so that we can adopt enhanced risk management measures."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we must begin, and soon, our efforts for the gradual replacement of dangerous substances."
"If alternative products exist, replacement must be our first choice."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, REACH has been one of the most important, most extensive and also most complex pieces of legislation to have been discussed in this House in recent years."
"I should like to be the first to congratulate Mr Sacconi on the result achieved."
"In recent weeks, he has spoken a great deal about his dog, who desperately wanted him to do a little less 'REACHing' and spend a bit more at home with him instead."
"Your dog, Mr Sacconi, must be a terrier, given the tenacity with which you got your teeth into this issue, which meant that it was not always easy for the shadow rapporteurs to get what they wanted."
"Thanks to REACH legislation, the 30 000 chemical substances that are available within the European market are once again being mapped out; the relevant information will be verified and applications will, where necessary, be regulated."
"This involves all substances that are produced in quantities of 1 tonne or more annually."
"Others give us a different account."
"Moreover, REACH replaces a set of very impenetrable legislation that has eventually made the European market unworkable."
"What we need to do is to let REACH do what it is supposed to do."
"It has proven its worth: 1.3 million people are working in the chemical industry, 27 000 mainly small, but also large, companies work with REACH, or will do so in future; the turnover involved is EUR 440 billion."
"That is what makes it important that we should make this legislative package sound."
"The compromise that is now before us is, as I see it, the best compromise we could get after many long and difficult negotiations where extreme views were required to find the middle ground."
"The compromise is very precarious, because on the one hand it protects man, the environment and the consumer, and limits animal testing, while on the other, it also offers an opportunity for creating the best possible climate for European industry."
"We can tell the Finnish minister that, whilst we are pioneers, we must ensure that our position also bears fruit."
"REACH ensures that the responsibility is shifted from the Member States to the companies themselves, which is the most important improvement in respect of the common position."
"Other key points to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are the fact that confidential company data is protected more effectively, registration is better tailored to the Nassauer/Sacconi package - it is just unfortunate that nothing more came of this - and red tape is being reduced to a minimum."
"A sound balance has also been struck in the areas of authorisation and substitution."
"It is now up to the Commission to ensure that this piece of legislation will also be viable."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my supposition is that 99.9% of my group will vote in favour of this compromise put together by Mr Sacconi;"
"If anyone could negotiate this difficult path between Scylla and Charybdis it was probably he - he who was always available for dialogue, who tried to achieve compromise even though he always had his own ideas in his mind, and that compromise is one that is acceptable to large sections of this House and of the European public."
"What are we talking about?"
"We are talking about learning something about chemicals of which we are at present ignorant."
"We are talking about our desire to protect nature, and, above all, the health of those people who use chemicals, whether as consumers or as workers with them."
"With that end in mind, the compromise is a good one."
"A compromise remains, of course, a compromise and nothing more."
"The best proof of its being a good one is probably that nobody ends up being really satisfied."
"Mr Sacconi is certainly not one hundred percent happy with it, and nor, as a whole, are we, but, even so, I am persuaded that this is the best that we could have achieved."
"It is, at any rate, better than many other proposals that I have had sight of, and so, on Wednesday, I too shall be voting in favour and will be doing so out of conviction."
"What, though, do we have here in black and white?"
"Many describe it as a monster. Of course, it is not one."
"The description of 'monstrous' is far better applied to the forty pieces of legislation that we had before."
"This is a compact package, and not one that is easily read by all, but those who make the effort can manage it."
"It is also a good thing that we have agreed to review its scope in five years' time, but what will happen to medical apparatus or other individual products then?"
"Does this have to cover them, or would we be better advised to exclude them?"
"That would make sense; it is also right that we have made improvements where the protection of data is concerned."
"Whatever the demands of transparency and people's entitlement to information, data must be protected; we also have to ensure that there is active support for research projects and that research can still be carried out at universities and other facilities."
"All these things are good."
"So what is not good?"
"What is not good is what is going to happen to small and medium-sized businesses."
"Commissioner Verheugen said so, and I am grateful to him for so doing; if we are not watchful, it is the small and medium-sized enterprises who could end up picking up the tab for our ambitious legislation, and it is time we gave some thought to them."
"What I urge Commissioners Dimas and Verheugen to do is to amend the definition for small and medium-sized businesses; that is long overdue and will help some of them, but I also urge them to set up a helpdesk that will help such firms, translate for them, and actually ensure that they get help, for the ones this legislation will affect do not know to which transition period they are subject, when - and for what - they have to register, or when this or that will start to apply to them."
"Let me conclude by saying that, if we are serious about this - and to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten as much as to anyone else, I emphasise the 'if' - then we will make sure that a good and effective agency is in place without delay."
"That will involve money."
"That is something that the Council Presidency will have to deal with; let it tell the Council's members that that is what we need the money for."
"We in this House must do likewise."
"My apologies to Mr Ouzký; normally I stay until the end of any debate in which I have spoken, but I now have a meeting of this House's Bureau to go to."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it seems such a calm conclusion to such a tempestuous debate."
"It is some seven years since REACH was first announced to ministers at the Environment Council."
"Remember the fears about all the impact assessments and the wild figures about how much REACH was going to cost and the risk that this would lead to the European chemical industry disappearing from the shores of this continent and relocating in China."
"Within this Chamber there have been all sorts of parliamentary tactics to delay and destroy REACH over the years, and here we are with a remarkable measure of agreement all round."
"Perhaps in practice we have made some modifications."
"We are on the right track."
"I have high hopes for REACH."
"I hope it will enable us to identify, control and replace chemicals that are detrimental to our health and environment."
"I hope it will be implemented without excessive difficulty, particularly for SMEs, at a cost that will not threaten the competitiveness of our industry."
"I hope it will stimulate the validation and development of alternative non-animal testing methods."
"I hope it will promote innovation within the industry and give Europe a cutting edge in the world."
"I hope it will not lead to a transfer of jobs but instead will increase consumers' confidence, here in Europe and across the world, in the chemicals our industry produces."
"I hope that enough scientists will want to brave the dark winters of Finland in order to ensure the European Chemicals Agency is the success we hope it will prove."
"I hope this is going to set a lead for the entire world, a regulatory regime that will be a benchmark for governments elsewhere."
"I hope the package we have agreed between us, with much assistance from the Finnish Presidency over recent months and of course with the guidance of Mr Sacconi, will firmly steer the industry towards substituting chemicals of high concern by safer alternatives and promote the development of such alternatives."
"I hope for all those things, but probably a lot of water still has to flow under the bridge before my hopes will be realised."
"There are a lot of imponderables."
"How will the European Chemicals Agency really interpret its remit and how will REACH be defined in practice?"
"Only time will tell."
"I am not ecstatic about the result."
"I have accepted compromises that I would have preferred to have avoided."
"I would have preferred stronger emphasis on substitution."
"It was a terrible mistake that, right at the end of the negotiations, the Council actually offered us the chance to incorporate hormone disruptors - endocrine disruptors - within the socio-economic categories - the substitution categories - and we as a Parliament declined and settled for a review in six years' time."
"That is astonishing!"
"However, I do not agree with one spokesman for WWF, who recently denounced the final outcome of REACH as a disgrace."
"On the contrary, it is very much a step in the right direction and, if our hopes are realised, it may prove to be one of the most significant measures this Union has ever taken, of real long-term advantage both to our economy and our environment."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, the original purpose of REACH was to protect people and the environment."
"The beneficial effects of increased knowledge and of developing better ways of using chemicals should include economic advantages."
"In November, The Lancet published a report showing that 200 common chemicals cause brain damage, difficulties in concentrating, behavioural disorders and lower intelligence."
"How are we to obtain a society based on knowledge, innovation and development when we needlessly allow chemicals that reduce intelligence and make it difficult to concentrate?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have had many long meetings."
"Again and again, it has been confirmed that a qualified majority here in Parliament thinks it self-evident that consumer products containing dangerous substances should always be replaced with less dangerous alternatives when these are available."
"Again and again, we have agreed that chemical safety reports should be introduced for all low-volume chemicals."
"Again and again, we have emphasised the importance of transparency and openness and laughed at how absurd it is that the board that is to take important decisions about the future of chemicals should be secret and have secret financial interests."
"We have thought it self-evident that companies should be responsible for their products and have also taken decisions that would give small companies fair conditions."
"Now, at the eleventh hour when things are getting serious, a majority of you have chosen not to care about these objectives and, instead, to leap into the German chemicals industry's unsafe embrace."
"In spite of the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety demanded substantial improvements in REACH, the last trialogue only made things worse."
"It was the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that played the chemical industry's game, but why did the others join in?"
"REACH should now instead be called RISK, standing for the registration but inadequate substitution of chemicals."
"The last time we voted on REACH, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe came to an agreement with the Right on the registration aspect."
"This time, you have come to an agreement on the whole of REACH."
"On the previous occasion, Mr Sacconi said that an agreement is like an apple: it must be picked when it is ripe."
"After the debate, you gave me the apple."
"A year later, it is now a perfectly disgusting and soggy lump."
"I have therefore brought a new apple with me to give to you."
"Keep it for a few years until the overhaul of REACH, when it will smell putrid and remind you to come to an agreement with another majority."
"What would be better by far is if you were to come to an agreement with ourselves on the alternative compromise, symbolised by the core of this apple."
"Let us regard this apple core as symbolising a REACH that grows and takes root, a REACH from which we shall be able to reap environmental and public health benefits in decades to come, instead of selling windfalls to the nations of Europe."
"It is you who must choose."
"Do you want a REACH apple that turns rotten or a core that grows?"
"In politics, nothing is won unless risks are taken."
"You should dare to take this last opportunity now, obtain a clear majority in Parliament and negotiate openly with the Council."
"We can never obtain anything worse than the Council's common position, but we can obtain something so much better."
"One of the advantages of conciliation is that there would, at any rate, be more democracy than is afforded by this rotten agreement reached behind closed doors."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I will not go into the details of the analysis of the REACH compromise that will be put before us."
"My colleague Mr Holm will do that in a few moments. For my part, I would like to dwell on just one idea: REACH is both a fine illustration of what Europe could be and a sad confirmation of its contradictions today."
"Only a few weeks ago, REACH promised to be the sign of a real ambition for Europe."
"The European Union was going to adopt legislation that at last put public health and the environment above short-term economic calculation; it was at last requiring undertakings to take account of the social cost of their headlong pursuit of competitiveness; it was at last learning the lessons of the asbestos scandal and, given that the new legislation would also cover products imported in considerable quantities, Europe was forcing world industry to adapt to its new standards."
"Europe therefore had a great opportunity, in an area that very much strikes a chord among our citizens, to forge itself an identity of progress by changing conditions here and in the world."
"With this in view, many non-governmental organisations, trade unions and elected representatives have worked actively to make this fine project a success."
"Many of them are now very disillusioned at the excessive concessions made to the big European groups."
"Admittedly, and this is an important point to make, the reversal of the burden of proof remains."
"It is no longer up to the authorities to prove that the chemicals used are toxic, but for industry to show that they are safe."
"That being the case, what justification can there be for allowing undertakings to continue, even if under supervision, to use substances that are acknowledged to be very dangerous even though less harmful alternatives are available on the market?"
"After the terrible precedent of asbestos, this is ethically unacceptable, as is the right given to company managements to keep secret the information they hold on the possible toxicity of chemical substances less than 10 tonnes of which are produced in a year, as is the case of the great majority of them."
"Please stop using the financial weakness of small and medium-sized enterprises as a pretext!"
"My group tabled an amendment requiring large companies to provide SMEs with the information they possess on the substances in question in order to save them pointless expenditure."
"That amendment was rejected by the authors of the majority compromise."
"One last comment worth thinking about."
"This second-rate compromise is not the result of economic weakness in the face of an unequal balance of power; the bad example comes from the top."
"The REACH legislation is too ambitious."
"It is not the kind of project that the Commission will be presenting in future, Mr Verheugen, the Commission Vice-President responsible for industry, said back in mid-September."
"The most worrying thing is that he made that announcement during a speech on the 'Better Regulation' initiative, which says a lot about the strategic direction that pernicious slogan indicates."
"We have seen its effects in the social field, with the 'Services' Directive and the Green Paper on labour law, for example."
"Now it is the turn of public health and the environment to be affected."
"The debate on what has got to change in European integration is decidedly more topical than ever."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I joined the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety just after the last election almost two and a half years ago and saw at first hand the divisions and differences of opinion in relation to REACH."
"I must say that I have been highly impressed by the efforts of so many people, and in particular I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, the shadow rapporteurs, the chairman of our group, Mr Florenz, the Commission and the Council, and all who have compromised to bring about this package."
"I think it shows the ability of the European Union and its institutions to come together in matters of common interest - it shows that we can compromise and have debate."
"If our constituents saw us in this light they would be very impressed."
"There is no doubt about the existence of a growing cocktail of chemicals in our daily lives."
"Under the current patchwork of legislation, without sufficient information on the majority of existing chemicals, we are unsure of the quantity of chemicals used and the effect on our health and our environment."
"This agreement is groundbreaking in terms of regulation which will clearly benefit consumers and our environment through tighter safety controls."
"We will be better informed."
"There will be growing impetus for companies to invest and evolve in terms of research and development and substitution plans."
"In addition to the fine balance attained, I am very satisfied to see the increased assistance for SMEs, the promotion of alternatives to animal testing, community-wide labelling, and creation of an EU agency to manage the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system at Community level."
"We must be mindful, however, that the aim of this legislation is also to improve the competitiveness of the chemical industry, one that is very important in my own country and creates quite a number of jobs directly and indirectly."
"The institutions have worked hard to ensure that the burden for industry, and particularly SMEs, is not too costly, will protect confidential business information, reduce red tape and will not threaten jobs, whilst still delivering a win-win situation for citizens, workers and our ecosystem."
"Our big challenge now is to implement the REACH regulation in our respective countries to ensure that it gets proper representation for those who send us here."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation for Mr Sacconi."
"It is his guidance that has enabled this House to secure the best possible result from the negotiations, which was difficult enough with a divided Parliament and a Council that held onto its common position for dear life."
"The fact that eventually, following tough negotiations, results that we can live with have been achieved in different areas deserves credit."
"I can easily see why the environmental movement and the chemical industry are dissatisfied with the compromise, but it is certainly true that in this case, the better is the enemy of the good."
"The lack of compromise at second reading would have either led to adoption of a virtually unchanged common position or to a long-drawn out conciliation, with the possible consequence of the entire proposal being withdrawn or rejected."
"In this case, something is better than nothing."
"I should like to draw your attention to one final point, namely that I think that the Member States should be able to adopt stricter environmental policy than is currently laid down; this is certainly true if countries such as Sweden and Denmark are set to apply such stricter legislation."
"This is why I will be voting for the amendment that was tabled, by myself and others, on this subject."
"I should like to apologise, not least to the Commissioner and Mr Sacconi, for my inability to be present for the rest of the debate, a fact occasioned by a vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this compromise bears Parliament's imprint."
"This is the second time - the first being when we dealt with the Services Directive - that this House has made the decisive contribution to achieving a solution in an important piece of legislation."
"It is good that the solution was found here in Parliament."
"Nevertheless, it is a compromise - no other solution was possible at the time, and even mediation would have undoubtedly proved very problematic."
"For this reason, the right course of action is to endorse this compromise - although I do so only with considerable reservations."
"This REACH regime signifies revolutionary progress with regard to knowledge about approximately 30 000 substances used in trade and industry."
"This means dramatic progress for health and the environment in Europe, as the President-in-Office rightly pointed out."
"Why, however, I ask him, did he fail to say a single word about the fact that we are not only transferring responsibility for substances to enterprises, but also imposing considerable costs on them?"
"Why did he not mention that we are introducing new bureaucratic procedures in Europe, and thus doing the exact opposite of what we proclaim in our soapbox speeches about cutting red tape and achieving the Lisbon objectives?"
"I think that honesty requires us to admit that we want this environmental progress but are imposing considerable costs on the business and industrial community in the process."
"Time will tell whether, as Mr Verheugen and I hope, the competitiveness of this community can withstand that."
"The fact is that, first of all, costs are being mentioned that could have been lower."
"The Finnish Council Presidency rejected a relaxation of testing requirements for low tonnages. Firstly, these tests are expensive, secondly, they are not very useful, and thirdly, they require enormous amounts of animal testing."
"It would have been better to revert to the solution found at first reading by Parliament, together with Mr Sacconi - to whom I am obliged for his work."
"What comes next?"
"The next step is the implementation of this massive piece of work, this Regulation, which takes effect immediately - that is to say, does not first need to be transposed into national law."
"A decisive factor in this regard will be the way that the Commission and the Agency deal with those concerned."
"I would ask the two Commissioners, in particular, namely Messrs Dimas and Verheugen - who are more acutely aware than others that the organisation of REACH tends to put small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage - to work together with SMEs on implementation in a spirit of partnership, and also to ensure that the European economy can withstand this strain."
"(FI) Mr President, after long and involved discussions, negotiations, committee votes and compromises we are witnessing the shape that REACH is to assume."
"The situation that has prevailed hitherto, as has been said here, is one where we simply know too little about almost all the chemicals in the internal market."
"Over the decades, tens of thousands of chemicals have come onto the market, and their effect on the environment and human health is unknown."
"Our current legislation on chemicals prevents new and better chemicals from coming onto the market, because it supports a situation where it is possible and cheaper to use old chemicals."
"This is therefore a barrier to innovation under the Lisbon Strategy."
"REACH's main instrument is the obligation of industries that use chemicals and importers regarding registration."
"In recent weeks we have discussed in particular the authorisation procedure and the related substitution procedure."
"The European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, have worked their hardest to improve the Commission's original proposal and the Council's common position on the possibility of substituting chemicals that are better for the environment and people's health for hazardous chemicals and chemicals of concern."
"This work has been consistent and we have to acknowledge that it has produced an excellent outcome."
"After the vote at first reading not many believed that we would be able actually to achieve a result."
"Now we have a good one."
"According to the compromise now being discussed, all hazardous substances will be covered by the substitution procedure and the most hazardous chemicals must always be replaced if a substitute chemical is available and its use is financially and technically feasible."
"In addition, a substitution plan or research plans must be produced for other substances of concern as a condition of access to the market."
"I would just like to comment on the apple comparison."
"I myself at least would sooner pick and eat an apple while it was ripe, and I would not wait for it to go rotten."
"Similarly, I think it is important to realise when decisions need to be made and when the best moment is to pick this ripe apple."
"(SV) Mr President, the vote on Thursday is the end of a long process with important contributions from many quarters."
"I think that we should pay attention to Commissioner Wallström, who put forward the proposal, and to her democratic innovation involving major consultation through the Internet, which did an incredible amount to improve the REACH proposal itself."
"We must pay attention to those Members who have spent many nights labouring over this matter and with whom we have had some tough discussions: Mr Langen in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy; the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer; and a number of others, particularly the main rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and the Commissioners - both Mr Verheugen and Mr Dimas - who have done a lot of work to prepare this proposal for voting on."
"Nonetheless, I stand here with very mixed feelings."
"If I had to summarise the way I feel, I would say I felt proud but dissatisfied, to use an expression that has been current in Sweden for the last few years."
"For my part, I am proud to have had a part in this work in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, when I took three themes as my starting point."
"Firstly, the environmental aspects of the proposal need to be enhanced, especially when it comes to substitution."
"Secondly, the proposal needs to be clarified."
"There were an incredible number of ambiguities and instances of overlapping with other legislation, and we have now removed 'paper and pulp' and 'minerals and ores', these being important areas that do not, however, belong in this proposal."
"We have also simplified REACH - a move that has been very advantageous to small companies."
"I believe that the 'one substance, one registration' proposal will be very significant in the future."
"My point of departure was, then, that enhancement, clarification and simplification were good for European industry, European consumers and European citizens."
"I believe that the quest for a strong policy that takes account of both the market and the environment is a very important success factor."
"I am disappointed on three counts."
"Firstly, I think that we could have taken the opportunity to have given consumers clearer information and, in that way, met increasing environmental and consumer demands."
"It would have been possible, as we had done the job and assumed the costs."
"The compromise before us is not as advantageous as it might have been, and that, I think, is very sad."
"I should like to know how the Commission and the Council are to respond to the demand for a 0.1% limit. Is it the car that is to be regarded as being in some degree dangerous, or the dangerous component in the car that is to be regarded as being to some extent dangerous?"
"It is important to clarify these matters."
"The demand for substitution is a further issue."
"Why could we not have gone a step further when it comes to what we call CMR substances, which cause cancer, are mutagenic and affect reproduction?"
"My third question concerns duty of care."
"This has existed in European law on damages since Roman times and is not by any means an innovation."
"I think it would have been helpful to have had duty of care not merely explained as a principle in the recitals, but incorporated into the legislative text."
"Unfortunately, we have not brought these matters to a conclusion."
"I have a fourth issue to raise, namely that it is important for the developing countries now to be given the opportunity to use this information, so that no obstacle to trade is created."
"To summarise, then: I am proud but dissatisfied."
"The main job is still to be done and, to quote something said by an American a couple of weeks ago: 'We did not cross the Rubicon in order to sit there fishing'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the real work starts after the vote."
"Mr President, Christmas has come early for the German chemicals industry because, by supporting this incredibly watered-down compromise, Parliament will be giving the industry an early and unexpectedly large Christmas present, rewarding them for the relentless lobbying which has successfully torn the guts out of this proposal."
"Thanks to that lobbying and to compliant politicians, both from the Council and among members of the PPE-DE Group in particular, dangerous substances will remain on the market for many years to come, even when safer alternatives already exist."
"I think that is going to be hard to explain to European citizens."
"It is a scandal that they will have waited 20 years in total for rules that will continue to allow hazardous chemicals to be used in everyday products, even when substitutes are readily available."
"It is also completely unnecessary: the second reading in the Environment Committee gave the rapporteur a clear mandate to push for mandatory substitution for all chemical substances of high concern when safer alternatives exist."
"And yet that was given away, negotiated out of existence."
"Not only that, but the whole legislation will be shrouded in secrecy."
"It is completely unacceptable for key personnel in the agency that will implement this legislation to be able to keep their names and their declarations of interest confidential."
"That is outrageous, and it is extraordinarily ironic, too, that it comes at precisely the time when we are supposed to be convincing European citizens that the EU is open, transparent and accountable."
"How can we possibly be claiming that, and yet agree to confidentiality here?"
"In the view of my group, Parliament should have rejected the compromise deal and continued to press for a deal via a full second reading and conciliation."
"There is nothing in this package that we could not have achieved through conciliation, and much that we could have won."
"Instead, we have had a process that is untransparent, undemocratic and very easily manipulated."
"My group has put forward two alternative compromise packages."
"That is not unrealistic, as some have said."
"In fact, what we are proposing is weaker than what Parliament adopted in first reading, but it is still stronger than the pale and weak compromise on the table now."
"It is based precisely on the bottom lines that a majority in Parliament have supported all through this process until the very last moment, but then chose to give up as a concession to the rest of the PPE."
"So, when you, Mr Sacconi, ask us what other mountain we want to climb, the answer is: the one that has been on all of our maps from the very beginning of this process, the one that you told us we were climbing, which you were leading us up so well and so masterfully, until at the very last minute you lost your step, you lost your footing, you took a wrong turn and now we are all put in peril."
"One final point on animal welfare."
"During the first reading in the Environment Committee, I tabled a completely non-animal test strategy, which was adopted."
"It did not survive the subsequent plenary vote, but it did send a very strong signal that we want much greater emphasis on non-animal alternatives."
"The promotion of non-animal tests is now one of the objectives of the REACH regulation, and that is hugely important."
"It must not just be a gesture; it must be turned into a legal commitment to replace animal tests much faster than we have been doing."
"Animal tests are not only cruel, they are inefficient, they are outdated and they are frequently misleading."
"Replacing them as fast as possible is not just an issue of animal rights: it is an issue of human health and of human rights as well."
"(SV) Mr President, my father worked for more than 20 years in the heavy chemicals industry in Sundsvall in northern Sweden."
"Sometimes, he came home in the evenings with pain in his arms and legs."
"Sometimes, he was almost completely paralysed and had difficulty moving them."
"According to the doctor, he was suffering from acute metal poisoning."
"My father is now retired, and a number of the heavy metals by which he was affected are now banned. However, millions of workers are still affected by chemicals in European workplaces."
"According to a Finnish study, 32 million EU citizens are exposed every day to carcinogenic chemicals in their workplaces."
"It is for all these workers that we need a strong REACH."
"As has already been mentioned in quite a few very good speeches made earlier in this House, we also need a strong REACH for the environment and for all those of us who are consumers."
"That, however, is precisely why I am so disappointed that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and also the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have caved in to the chemicals industry and to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"This proposal fails workers, consumers and the environment."
"Mr Sacconi, you probably know better than any of us what workers are calling for."
"Workers want to see a strong REACH in which dangerous chemicals are substituted when there are better alternatives, to give just one example."
"Yet you have abandoned the basic principle."
"Is that because power and loyalty to the PPE-DE Group are more important?"
"I do not know."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot support this proposal."
"Why?"
"Let me give some concrete examples. This compromise contains no chemical safety report for low volume substances."
"This means that thousands of chemicals will continue to be distributed without our knowing what real risks they present."
"There is no legally binding duty of care and, in the light of this, we need to remember that the basic idea behind REACH was precisely that there should be such a duty and that, specifically, the burden of proof in connection with chemicals should lie with companies and not with the authorities."
"Big companies will be able to keep the facts about the chemicals they use secret once the PPE-DE Group has had its demands accepted for an enhanced intellectual property law."
"Small companies, which will not be able to benefit from increased transparency, will be the big losers."
"The obviously legitimate demand that the Member States should be able to have more far-reaching legislation has not been approved, either."
"Above all, what should have been a gain in terms of public health and the environment now rings hollow, namely the substitution principle."
"This principle, which states that dangerous chemicals must be replaced when there are less dangerous alternatives, is now so restricted that it is only a very small number of chemicals that will be phased out."
"As a result, we shall still be surrounded by thousands of dangerous chemicals that are carcinogenic or toxic for reproduction or that have endocrine disruptive effects."
"We in the GUE/NGL Group want to save REACH."
"We have therefore, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, submitted a common REACH package involving amendments requiring stronger wording in all these areas."
"In order to minimise the number of animal experiments, we also call for efforts to implement completely new animal-free methods involving 'toxigenomics'."
"The demands we are making are not unreasonable, since a good deal of them were supported by a majority of this House a year ago."
"In conclusion, we shall, on Wednesday, be voting on what is to be the world's most comprehensive chemicals law."
"There is still a chance of saving REACH, and I would call on you - especially you Socialists who claim to protect workers and the environment - to throw this PPE-DE Group agreement in the waste paper bin and to vote in favour of saving REACH."
"(PL) Mr President, the debate on the REACH regulation has long been generating many emotions and disputes."
"Feelings have run even higher as a result of the outrageously long list of amendments tabled, in excess of 5 000, and also because the true aims of the REACH regulation have now become clear, namely to promote the interests of the large chemical concerns that can draw on huge financial potential and the support of scientific research, which has simply become a tool enabling these globalised concerns to make even greater profits."
"Behind the façade of fine-sounding slogans about protecting health and the environment, the big players are trying to do away with small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They are focusing in particular on those from the new Member States of the Union that have so far been the driving force of Europe's economy."
"We are sceptical, too, about compromises that only postpone the elimination of smaller enterprises, thus depriving many people of jobs and the opportunity to better themselves."
"(DE) Mr President, rapporteur, Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am very grateful that we can now say that a compromise has been reached in the end."
"The kind of things I have had to listen to over the last week: 'Mr Florenz is an extension of the Chancellery; he is trying to enforce the will of the German chemicals industry; he even broke off the negotiations': all nonsense."
"I was simply aiming to generate the pressure needed to bring the various camps in Parliament closer together - namely the health and environment policy-makers on the one hand, who are rightly very committed, and the economic policy-makers on the other."
"That was the problem that was not so easily solved."
"I believe that we have reached a decent compromise on this."
"Everyone grumbles, everyone is dissatisfied, and, ultimately, that is the result of this compromise."
"Anyone who does not like that should not be participating in the parliamentary process."
"After all, things are not as simple as many of my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - whom I otherwise hold in high regard - may believe."
"There are various camps in this world, and that is why the debates we have held on the White Paper over the last three years have always been controversial."
"In my 18 years in this House, I have not experienced this as strongly with any other report as with the one on REACH."
"We have even seen some completely ridiculous proxy wars, and the atmosphere has not always been free of tension."
"One thing that has always been clear, however, is that we have a real pillar in the form of the fact that REACH has never been called into question by the industry."
"I am very pleased about that."
"I should like to remind the two Commissioners that they have announced their intention to withdraw 40 old directives and regulations that have now been superseded."
"I shall check that they do."
"This is the challenge they face, in addition to the implementing regulations - and it is something they do really have to do, in order to give us an advantage and to enable us to thin the jungle in this field."
"The three-step procedure - registration, evaluation and authorisation - is spot on."
"The industry will have to show that it looks upon the release and disclosure of data to the Agency as part and parcel of modern economic policy rather than an end in itself."
"I am convinced that, where there are better alternatives, these will also be joined by environmentally friendly ones in future, subject to economic viability."
"These are precisely what we want to promote."
"It is my belief and hope that this will not harm the industry but, quite on the contrary, will promote motivation."
"An important factor all along has been our focus on producer responsibility."
"This is not an end in itself, but is something that the industry must do in future."
"The matter of imports remains unresolved; this has not been sufficiently regulated, in my opinion."
"To conclude, one contentious issue is that of the disclosure of data."
"We need a political debate over how much of their know-how enterprises have to divulge."
"We obviously need consumer protection, but we also need to protect our enterprises, who provide our employment from Monday to Friday."
"Mr President, last month The Lancet, the leading UK medical journal, published a report which spoke about a silent pandemic amongst children developing neurological disorders from exposure to industrial chemicals."
"There needs to be a lot more research on that."
"But we now have a chance to act on chemicals, and we should seize that chance."
"The compromise package agreed by Parliament and the Council is a very good one."
"I want to pay tribute to the skill of Mr Sacconi, our chief negotiator, who worked in an extremely transparent and collaborative manner throughout these negotiations."
"I reject the accusation that it was untransparent."
"He always reported back to his shadows and to the committee, and people were kept informed, much more informed than on other pieces of legislation."
"People have said that the compromise does not go far enough, that it falls short of perfection."
"It is not a perfect compromise."
"The Greens and the GUE/NGL Group have said that they will not support the compromise, which does not surprise me."
"However, the point of politics is not to grandstand or to reject compromises and go down in glorious defeat and remain politically pure, but to make a difference and to bring about real change that affects real people."
"That is what this legislation will do."
"I heard people talking about mountains, but they are going to take us up mountains in the same way as Sisyphus pushing a great big rock up the mountain."
"We would never get agreement and therefore nothing would ever happen, and back down the mountain we would roll."
"I saw the majorities obtained in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and there was no majority to get anything better than what we have on the table this evening."
"I agree with Commissioner Verheugen, who spoke about the need to make this legislation implementable, and I look forward to hearing what he is going to be doing and how we are going to work with the chemical industry and governments to ensure it works properly."
"By voting 'yes' to REACH this week we can start to implement the legislation to get the agency up and running."
"I do not want to hang around waiting for miracle solutions some other day."
"I urge colleagues to vote 'yes' this week and make a difference, not just worry about making headlines."
"(FR) Mr President, on 20 September 2003, before we started our work here, Mr Chirac, Mr Blair and Mr Schroeder wrote to the European Commission asking it not to undermine the competitiveness of the chemical industry."
"Intervention, and of course pressure, at that level was unprecedented in our codecision history, and I have to say that at that moment the die was cast: REACH would fall short, far short of the aspirations set out in the White Paper, for example, back in 2001."
"It is of course out of the question for us to handicap this sector, which is one of the most competitive and dynamic in European industry."
"We have always, each one of us, listened to its concerns."
"REACH will be workable."
"Witness the less stringent registration procedure for substances produced in quantities of one to ten tonnes, the strengthening of the future Helsinki agency, the affirmation - it has been said many times - of the one substance, one registration (OSOR) principle to facilitate the exchange of information between undertakings."
"It is also important to limit data input costs."
"Indeed this is essential for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There is also this possibility of an opt-out, duly justified by the applicant."
"These are considerable steps forward and I would have been delighted with them today if we had not capitulated on the principle of substitution."
"What remains of it is not even a dilution;"
"I would say rather it is an illusion, a selective, case by case, gradual substitution, including for substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, if there are proper controls - and I am quoting the text here."
"In particular, REACH is also a blank cheque for endocrine disruptors - plasticisers, insecticides, flame retardants, all of which are among the most lethal chemical agents for human health - a blank cheque signed by our Parliament, whereas the Finnish Presidency was agreeable to making substitution mandatory here."
"I find this utterly astonishing."
"Europe has turned its back on its own people."
"Try explaining to them today that we are not withdrawing from the market a substance that is a health hazard, especially if a safer alternative exists."
"I am ashamed, too, of the European authorities' refusal to listen to the two million doctors, to the authorities and leading experts of the scientific world who are constantly drawing our attention to this silent pandemic created, among other things, by chemical pollution."
"I have read the same article in the Lancet as Mrs McAvan and Mr Schlyter."
"So our meeting with People's Europe this Wednesday 13 December will feel like a let-down, to put it mildly, and all those who, like me, are taking the risk of combining health and sustainable employment instead of continuing to treat them as incompatible in so sterile and obsolete a manner, now have only one or two minutes to express their disappointment."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the image of a mountain has been used many times today."
"All I can say in that regard is: the mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse."
"This is a shaky compromise - no amount of glossing over can hide that fact."
"Looking at the starting position at first reading, Parliament has quite clearly given way."
"This compromise is a Christmas gift to the European chemicals industry, and the imprint of the German chemicals-industry lobby is clearly visible."
"The European public is not being told why Parliament has given up the substitution requirement."
"REACH will offer no incentives for replacing chemicals of particular concern with safer alternatives."
"The heart of substitution has been sacrificed on the altar of the chemicals industry."
"This is indeed shameful, because human beings, nature and animals will continue to be test subjects in a large-scale experiment in future."
"It is particularly shameful because chemicals do not even need to be replaced when there are feasible alternatives."
"Not even catch phrases such as 'substitution plan' or 'appropriate controls' can hide this fact."
"This is a will-o'-the-wisp, an eyewash, as European industrial toxins are turning up where they have no business being, namely in the blood of babies and adults, in mothers' milk, in drinking water and in the fatty tissue of polar bears."
"We are also deceiving ourselves if, like one of the previous speakers, we believe that research is being carried out into the very neurotoxic substances that feature in the alarming brain study to which she refers."
"Nor will there be any compulsory testing in this connection."
"These substances will continue to circulate on the market, therefore, even where there are feasible alternatives; that is what is really shameful."
"This compromise also makes a mockery of transparency."
"The fact that members of the European Chemicals Agency can keep their names and financial interests secret is not only absurd but also signifies the disempowerment of consumers, who will continue to grope around in the dark."
"Not only are they exposed to the risks, they cannot protect themselves from them either."
"There is only a very small number of chemicals about which consumers can find out information - and only after going through a lengthy individual process."
"This is the age of the Internet, yet we have not managed to allow consumers to access this information online."
"We are talking about substances causing neurological and hepatic disorders, of all things, and they are not allowed to know anything."
"REACH is a sham, therefore."
"Parliament started out a tiger, but ended up a bedside rug."
"(EL) Mr President, the subject we are discussing has nothing to do with the primary objective of REACH."
"It is common knowledge that hundreds of chemical substances contribute to occupational diseases and deaths; however the only thing that was pushed forward after a series of amendments and anti-scientific criteria, were the interests of the businessmen of the chemical industry at the expense of employees' health and the environment."
"Essential provisions were removed, so that there would be no need to control or evaluate the effects of 90% of chemical substances."
"In essence, it allows the discretional implementation of the regulation depending on corporate requirements."
"The agreement between the PPE-DE Group, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Finnish Presidency takes one more step in the direction of bypassing any opposition and competition, in favour of the prosperity of big business."
"They increased the limits for not declaring substances."
"Long-term effects on employees and the environment are left uncontrolled and the Member States are prevented from enforcing stricter regulations."
"At the same time, any changes or replacements will be easier for the major companies, whereas small- to medium-sized enterprises will be unable to handle the cost and thus shrink in size."
"Therefore, it accommodates sector build-up in favour of the capitalists whose position as European Union type monopolies in the international market will be strengthened."
"(PL) Mr President, this decisive vote on the REACH regulation is taking place in December, when many parts of Europe are longing for snow and concern is being expressed about the current high temperatures."
"It is high time for us to take more measures aimed at protecting the environment and human health."
"The hard-fought compromise on REACH is a major step in that direction."
"Many concessions had to be made and many contradictory interests reconciled in order to attain it."
"For example, the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises had to be reconciled with those of large industrial concerns and the interests of poorer countries with those of richer ones."
"In addition, the interests of ardent defenders of the environment had to be reconciled with those of supporters of a more aggressive economy."
"It is worth noting that this debate is being held and this important regulation adopted in an enlarged Union including ten new countries."
"(SV) Mr President, the European Parliament could have chosen to follow a more environmentally friendly line and to have stood up to the Council in the negotiations on the Chemicals Directive."
"However, the big political groups have chosen to give way to the Council by accepting the very poor compromise that is on the table."
"The compromise cancels the substitution principle and, in practice, favours a single interest, namely that part of the European chemicals industry that is out of date and does not plan for the long term."
"That is unacceptable."
"What is most surprising is that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament chose to support this compromise."
"The truth is that the PSE Group has shown remarkable complaisance."
"It has caved in to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and to the short-term special interests of the chemicals industry."
"The compromise favours the out-of-date part of the European chemicals industry, while Europeans and Europe's modern industry are among the losers."
"The June List will therefore support what is proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Mr President, our rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, spent a lot of his speech, like a mountain goat, going up and down mountains, taking us with him and telling us that when you get to the top you feel exhilarated."
"I have to tell him that most of us feel exhausted."
"However, he has led us gamely through 140 articles, 17 annexes and nine appendices of the REACH proposals, and he can feel justifiably exhilarated to be bringing us towards a new, coherent system to identify and manage the risk of chemicals."
"It has been a long marathon."
"I am not sure whether you can have a marathon going up and down mountains, but if you could, it would probably take the nine years it is going to have taken once we come to April 2007 and put this in place."
"We have come a long way and we have had high ambitions, although not all of them have been met."
"That would explain some of the outbursts that he may have sensed behind him."
"However, what we have been seeking is to get the best possible ambition met."
"But we have to strike a balance - a balance between strong environmental and health protection, phased but comprehensive gathering of data on all chemicals, legal certainty, protection of intellectual property for businesses and minimising the need for animal testing through data sharing and the promotion and validation of non-animal test methods."
"That is a compromise, and that is where we are."
"At the heart of that compromise is substitution, and the authorisation procedures with their mandatory substitution plans will phase out chemicals of very high concern where safer, viable alternative substances and technologies exist."
"Research plans will be required where they do not exist."
"We have made progress."
"I congratulate the Finnish Presidency on helping towards that."
"I regret that the British Government pulled the rug from under the feet of the Finnish Presidency at one point, otherwise we might have achieved a little more."
"As has been said, the future is implementation."
"The future is what the market will do with this."
"I believe that the market will respond and lead the way as manufacturers, retailers and consumers push for safer alternatives."
"We will be looking to competitive business to provide those greener products that consumers want."
"We will also see movements towards non-animal testing through the three-year review that will come from the agency."
"It will soon be Christmas."
"The best possible Christmas present is a REACH-free 2007."
"It will not be REACH-free in the Commission, but we will have a REACH-free agenda in Parliament."
"All the runners in this marathon deserve at least that respite!"
"(FR) Mr President, we know that chemical products can be dangerous and have catastrophic effects on health and the environment."
"It therefore seemed obvious that this text ought to be exemplary, leaving behind economic pressures and political divides."
"That is why, today, I am dismayed that the long debates have resulted in a compromise that falls short of our expectations and of what was voted for in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Yes, I am dismayed, and what dismays me in particular is that the principle of substitution, where alternatives exist, has been weakened by the proposal for a substitution plan and a socio-economic report, both of which will delay the replacement of dangerous substances."
"I hope the Agency will be resolute on these matters."
"Likewise, I agree with the European Trade Union Confederation."
"It is very disappointing that the chemical safety report will be mandatory only where production exceeds 10 tonnes, as this will not make for transparency on thousands of substances and will not allow risk management plans to be adopted."
"Finally, the subtleties expressed over CMR substances, implying that they are less dangerous than might appear, leave me perplexed."
"I am also dismayed that part of European industry has not immediately wanted to rise to the challenge of innovation and improve its public image."
"I say part of European industry because I know that some have already anticipated REACH."
"That is why, today, I can only hope that if the consolidated version of this regulation is adopted on Wednesday it will be implemented with the utmost stringency and the utmost transparency."
"I will close by thanking Mr Sacconi, whose task was not an easy one."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, rapporteurs, I hear my fellow Members express their disappointment."
"However, the compromise that is before us this week is in my view an acceptable agreement, since it has been reached on the basis of reciprocal concessions."
"I would like to highlight the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in this regard."
"So far as substitution is concerned, this had to be included in the debate on authorisation, as it is ultimately aimed at eliminating highly dangerous substances."
"Mandatory substitution was a fine objective, but not a realistic solution from a technical point of view."
"I can see one consequence of the compromise that has been reached here: undertakings will have to compete to develop substances with safer properties."
"Those that discover such alternative substances will therefore occupy a more favourable position on the market and the search for alternative substances will therefore become a challenge for them."
"I believe Article 137 of the compromise, on review, is important."
"An evaluation of the application of this mammoth piece of legislation after the first few years is essential."
"We will in fact already be in a position to assess how far we have come."
"At the same time, I think it will give us an opportunity to clarify the treatment of certain products, the intrinsic properties and uses of which have been known for a long time, such as lime and batteries, on which we have just adopted legislation."
"I do not believe these products are dealt with adequately in the present text."
"The fact that substances present in the natural state are treated in the same way as substances that are entirely artificial is a matter of particular concern to me."
"Another thing that concerns me is how this legislation will be put into practice by SMEs."
"When I last spoke in this House, I said we would have succeeded the day we adopted a system that was balanced, simple, effective and that enterprises could use."
"I rather doubt that we have achieved that."
"For that reason, I would like the Member States, trade associations, and NGOs, too, to create a climate that will allow SMEs to meet the requirements of this legislation, thereby helping to achieve its objectives."
"Moreover, since this legislation applies to imported products, it will have to gain acceptance in third countries, which will also have to begin to design and develop chemical products that do not harm human health or the environment."
"I believe this is an extremely important point."
"Finally, I hope that, at the forthcoming round of World Trade Organisation talks, where it might be expected that the European Union will raise non-tariff customs barriers, the EU will promote REACH as legislation necessary for the survival of the human race and the natural world."
"(FI) Ladies and gentlemen, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, for his long and exhausting ascent to the top of the mountain."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled two different proposals on REACH."
"One is that which the Greens are actually promoting; the other is the amendment that we had kept up our sleeve, which contains the improvements now adopted by the Council, but not the things that actually made it worse that were done on the last night of the negotiations at the request of the Conservatives and against the wishes of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Our alternative compromise is thus the summit of the mountain without the fog that clouds Mr Sacconi's pleasure."
"Two weeks ago in the Council, Finland managed to make the first small move in the direction of hazardous substance substitution, as called for by Parliament, when agents that interfere with hormones was added to the list of chemicals for substitution."
"I was flabbergasted when this step was blocked by the Conservatives on the last night of talks."
"Moreover, information on the identification of chemicals was classified as a trade secret."
"Throughout the debate on the chemicals legislation the Conservatives have been acting brutally and unscrupulously like messenger boys and girls for the chemical industry."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I understand everyone who wants a final decision now."
"The content of the proposal tabled in my name has already been approved by the Council."
"It merely lacks the adverse amendments made on the last night."
"You who have already voted for the strict substitution procedure and wish to rid our living environment of the most hazardous chemicals, if you are to be consistent, you will support this proposal and dispel the fog at the summit of the mountain."
"Our citizens will be asking what you did to protect their health from hazardous chemicals."
"(EL) Mr President, these past days the lobby of the chemical industry is celebrating."
"It achieved at least 90% of its goals."
"It has changed REACH completely."
"From the Commission's initial proposal, only a few things have remained."
"Yesterday's opponents have become the most loyal supporters."
"The principle of substitution has essentially been undermined at the expense of public health, the environment and the employees of the chemical industry."
"Today's compromise essentially means the Socialists have adopted the views of the European Right and of the chemical industry."
"It is far behind the initial Commission proposal, but also far behind the things we voted for, both at first reading and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Even though I respect them, I honestly cannot understand why Commissioner Dimas and rapporteur Mr Sacconi were celebrating."
"Until yesterday they were supporting and promoting completely different things."
"Congratulations Commissioner Verheugen."
"You managed to kill REACH."
"(PL) Mr President, chronic malnutrition in the world has been reduced by half since 1945, despite the significant population increase."
"Average life expectancy has gone up."
"Energy is being produced and consumed more efficiently, enabling us to protect the environment."
"This is all due to the development of industry and science in the 19th and 20th centuries."
"It follows that we should not support unduly severe or expensive regulations in our search for solutions that are good for people and for the environment."
"Tightening up the provisions on registration and authorisation will burden industry with enormous costs."
"It will mean cutting expenditure on innovation."
"Less innovation will result in us and our children being exposed to more dangerous substances in our daily lives."
"That is how things stand."
"It is not rigid environmental bans and orders but technical and scientific advances that will guarantee a healthier and cleaner future."
"More widely available authorisation, assessment of the social and economic factors as part of the authorisation procedure, and a more flexible procedure are the great advantages of the compromise reached on 30 November."
"We shall therefore be voting for it to be retained."
"(CS) It appears, then, that REACH is a done deal."
"Instead of concentrating on innovation, our businesses will now have to wade through a dense, 600-page regulation."
"Europe as a whole has once again moved towards lower competitiveness, so that here in Parliament we can once again moan about the failure of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Any competitor from a country not covered by the ridiculously named REACH will now find it even easier to compete with regulation-burdened Europe."
"REACH is a gift to our competitors."
"It is also a gift - and a rather expensive one - within the EU for the large companies and for the larger, wealthier countries."
"Whereas the costs entailed by the regulation can be borne by giant German companies, they will wipe out medium-sized businesses in the Czech Republic, for which the costs will exceed their average profits."
"Even though SMEs employ some 80% of the population, they will be destroyed by REACH, especially in the new Member States."
"REACH will thus become a sophisticated weapon in the competitive struggle within the EU and an instrument with which the big and wealthy will be able to dominate the small and poor."
"Hence the sudden, oh-so touching agreement on this pathetic regulation."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioners, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, if we manage to approve the REACH compromise this week, this House will have proved for the second time during this term that it listens to the laments of the people and that it is capable of taking its responsibility in very extensive and complex technical matters and of helping bring those matters to a good end."
"The negotiators had a very difficult task to contend with and I should like to extend sincere congratulations on the agreement reached."
"I am delighted to note that an agreement was reached at second reading."
"Everything had, after all, been said and it was time to bring matters to a close and to let those who have to put these ideas into practice in the field go ahead and do just that."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have always been reluctant to unilaterally back one or the other lobby."
"We have continually endeavoured to strike a balance - a balance between the ambition to increase health and environmental protection, on the one hand, and to maintain a competitive edge and prevent unnecessary administrative burdens, on the other."
"As I see it, we have done a reasonable job of this."
"That nobody is 100% satisfied is inherent in the nature of a compromise such as this one."
"I take the view that, with the package on which we are to vote on Wednesday, we have improved on previous texts that we drafted and voted on during the course of this legislative procedure on many different fronts."
"In the area of licensing policy, we are certainly making progress, both in terms of conditions under which licences for dangerous substances are granted and in terms of the duration of these licences."
"The protection of intellectual property has been reinforced, which was necessary, and unnecessary tests on animals are being banned."
"I am persuaded that the large undertakings will know what to do with our compromise text, but am not so sure about the smaller ones, and in this respect, we in the Group of the European People's Party are relying on the implementing measures and the necessary accompanying measures; if the Commission has something up its sleeve in this respect, I should like to find out shortly."
"Having weighed everything up, we will endorse the package, because we know that in 11 years' time, we will have drastically renewed chemical substances policy and will have made it transparent."
"Europeans will live with fewer health risks, and we are relying on the fact that the competitiveness of industry will not be impaired but rather strengthened."
"Naturally, undertakings pay a price, and not a small one."
"Most people in society, however, are asking for more health information and more health protection, and this is something that is only set to increase."
"In time, a REACH tested label can become a commercial asset instead of an economic handicap, and, as has been said here before, our legislation will be able to become normative at a global level."
"We must in any event set down to work by, inter alia, launching sound information campaigns directed at the consumers."
"(NL) Mr President, after nearly four years and thousands of amendments, REACH is finally a reality."
"All credit, of course, to our rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, who has managed to bring all this to a very good end."
"The result is something we can be proud of."
"Replacement has become one of the REACH objectives."
"REACH is not just about knowledge of thousands of chemical substances, but also about the replacement of 2 500 dangerous substances."
"It is high time dangerous substances, over which there is much disquiet, were finally prohibited."
"The increase in the number of cancer patients, allergies and fertility problems in humans and animals are associated with dangerous substances."
"The vast majority of people working in the chemical industry are doing everything they can to exercise utmost care when dealing with dangerous substances, but it does not, unfortunately, go without saying that everyone will do so."
"Of course, I have sympathy for industry's view that replacement cannot be done overnight."
"It is a good thing that the new agreement allows for a little more flexibility."
"It is now being examined on a case-by-case basis how long a licence for a dangerous substance can last."
"This is progress for producers."
"A study plan must be drafted in order to develop safe alternatives that benefit the environment as well as innovation."
"It will be an enormous challenge, in the next few years, to remove the most dangerous substances from the production process and from products."
"REACH has brought about this innovation that benefits both our competitiveness and the environment."
"Everything, of course, now hinges on effective implementation and what matters is to ensure that the small and medium-sized companies can be part of the change."
"A first review is planned in seven years' time, at which point we will be able to examine whether it is still possible to include more substances within the scope of REACH, and we will be able to consider whether the hormone deregulating substances can still be included within the scope of replacement regimes."
"That is when, hopefully, care duty will also be given the necessary attention and when information duty to employees and consumers can be further improved."
"Until such time, this is what we will have to work with, and I think an excellent compromise has been brokered."
"(FR) Mr President, with REACH, together we, including Mr Sacconi, our rapporteur, have raised tremendous hopes that our environment can be rid of the persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic chemical substances that are poisoning our health and the natural environment."
"The plan to regulate chemical products awakened environmental and social consciences in Europe and even beyond our borders."
"As a result, the massive amount of dialogue with civil society - trade unions, NGOs, undertakings and manufacturers - will have brought some agreement on the necessity of improving public health and the quality of the environment and of providing the public and workers with information on the chemical products that surround us."
"Sadly, despite an encouraging message from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the current compromises will weaken this REACH project."
"How can we explain to our fellow citizens that we will not be holding manufacturers responsible for spreading toxic substances, but that it will be consumers and workers who handle dangerous substances who will have to bear that responsibility?"
"How are we to explain that Parliament advocates the substitution of carcinogenic and mutagenic molecules and endocrine disruptors but is not making it a systematic requirement?"
"And what are we to say about the lack of transparency of the information on the most dangerous substances?"
"We find that unacceptable and incomprehensible."
"Even if many small and medium-sized industries and enterprises have taken on board the added value of green chemicals, the heavyweights of the European chemical industry are refusing to change."
"They continue to influence our work despite the financial burden on our health system of the growth in pathologies, which Mr Nassauer, incidentally, completely overlooks."
"A great responsibility rests on us today and we must vote accordingly."
"The Greens' amendments will strengthen REACH, make it meaningful and prevent it delaying the substitution of the most dangerous products indefinitely;"
"Mr Sacconi recognises this."
"Finally, I will say that this compromise may be a great step for the chemical industry, but it will remain a climb-down for our Parliament."
"I noticed that some colleagues were signalling that there was no interpretation."
"It was not a mistake on the part of our interpreters."
"In her contributions Ms de Brún usually uses Irish, which is not yet an official language in this House."
"That situation will change next year."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the two Commissioners and Parliament for breaking an amazing record: with this report, I mean the draft law, they have managed to attract more lobbyists than any other time."
"A reporter, outside this room, told me that he has not seen so many lobbyists in Strasbourg before."
"I, for one, will not assist these lobbyists with my vote."
"They are preparing a party after Wednesday night's vote."
"It is true."
"Can we accept the lobbyists' product as a reality, which only serves their needs?"
"And in essence, who is to gain from this?"
"Only major industries of major countries."
"Can Greece or the Czech Republic cope with the terms set out by this draft law?"
"I am very upset by the letter that Mr Verheugen sent to Mr Barroso 25 days ago, in which he interfered with Mr Dimas' responsibilities."
"Ever since, I have been very suspicious as to whether this entire matter could stand up to any serious criticism."
"And it does not."
"(DE) Anyone who remembers the time when, on 13 February 2001, Commissioners Wallström and Liikanen presented the White Paper, will have an idea of how far we have now come."
"I should like to express my particular thanks to the two Commissioners for increasing the focus on our jobs and the competitiveness of our economy under their responsibility and in their time."
"I had always assumed that the Council President, too, was firmly bound by the Common Position."
"Mr Sacconi has done a marvellous job but, to listen to the speeches in this House, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Communist Group and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance were in the majority."
"What nonsense; they do not even have 100 votes in Parliament."
"Therefore, this compromise, which enjoys the support of several of the groups, is a good one - even though it does not meet my expectations in all respects."
"To Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas, I would say that it is important that the implementation of this Regulation does not turn into a huge bureaucratic monster, but instead really sets an example of better lawmaking. Ease of use is essential to this end, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt pointed out."
"If we ask ourselves today what we failed to achieve, I would say that the issue of how to deal with substances in imported articles is the most difficult."
"No one can offer a solution to this issue."
"What is the good of having extremely tough legislation if the substances enter the EU in imported articles and businesses relocate from the EU?"
"The compromise is responsible because of the way it has been constructed."
"Not all the tests for small and medium-sized enterprises were necessary, and it would also have made sense to simplify the system by setting exposure and use categories."
"It is regrettable that this did not happen."
"Nevertheless, we shall support the compromise, and I hope that this European chemicals legislation will become a guideline for chemicals legislation worldwide."
"That is the challenge facing us."
"If we succeed, we shall have secured jobs in the EU and improved rather than weakened the competitiveness of our industry."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to pay tribute to Mr Sacconi, who did his utmost to come up with this good legislation."
"I started following the REACH debate as an Observer three years ago."
"It is more than encouraging to see that there has been an acceptable outcome to this long process."
"Coming from a new Member State, I am satisfied to see that my amendments have been built into the text."
"The Hungarian-British initiative should also be mentioned here as a relative success for my compatriots."
"Hopefully, Parliament and the Council will approve the final version in December, but it is not the end of the process."
"In seven years' time the state of the legislation will be reviewed."
"It will be a good opportunity to involve the substances in the 1-10 tonne range in the chemical safety report in order to ensure the safe use of such substances, as I and other Socialist colleagues proposed earlier."
"(CS) Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin once said: 'We meant to do it better but it came out as always'."
"This is a case in point."
"These rules, which in their current form work against the Lisbon Strategy and in favour of the big corporations that have come to terms with them in the hope of market dominance, are damaging to SMEs."
"Furthermore, the principle of data sharing, which is a good thing, is curtailed by the fact that there are no sanctions whatsoever in this area."
"The rules will threaten jobs in countries like mine and will have a knock-on effect in other sectors."
"I believe there are some people in the Chamber who will be happy with these rules."
"Aldous Huxley once said that happiness is like coke - something you get as a by-product of the process of making something else."
"Something similar will happen in this case, in the sense that while our group, as Mr Langen said, appeared to have a majority, it will take only a few more rules of this kind before we actually do have a majority."
"Mr President, well, we are at it again."
"In my view, Mr Sacconi is not so much building a mountain as digging himself an enormous hole."
"May I say at this festive time that I hope he mixes his martinis as enthusiastically as he mixes his metaphors."
"Whatever he says, we are talking of the regulation of over 30 000 substances, policed by another army of self-important inspectors who already suck at the teat of the overtaxed and over-regulated taxpayer."
"The extent of the regulation is bound to take the focus off relatively few instances where serious action is needed."
"Yet again, we British see in this directive the advancement of the abandonment of the presumption of innocence, with no redress for damages for British businesses, not to mention the horrific experimentation on millions of animals, whatever you may try and persuade yourself."
"I certainly beg my British federalist colleagues, all of whom support this misguided legislation, for once to get up off their bellies and strike a blow for our own national civil law and against the sovietism of this place."
"We all know the effect of Russian sovietism on Russia's own and the global environment."
"(PL) Mr President, chemical substances are part of our environment and can be found all around us."
"Rapid industrial development in the 20th century has meant, however, that our daily use of these substances has become not only a necessity but also a pleasure."
"Many of these substances do not genuinely improve our quality of life, though, as they are hazardous and harmful to our health."
"It is difficult to imagine life without chemical substances."
"That is precisely why we must insist on greater transparency and information about the substances contained in products used by human beings."
"The REACH system should be based on the principle of prevention and precaution."
"The need for the consumer to be assured that a particular product is not harmful must be central to the new legislation, and the responsibility for providing that assurance must rest with industry."
"Any producer wishing to place a new product on the market or retain an existing concession must be able to prove that the products for which he or she is responsible are safe for human beings and the environment."
"The compromise reached goes a long way towards responding to these expectations and therefore deserves our support."
"Nonetheless, like all compromises, it gives some cause for concern."
"In particular, I have reservations about the provisions concerning sharing information, as this will significantly weaken the position of around twenty-five thousand small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union."
"The attempts to extend the patent period, initially to 15 years and eventually to 12, are detrimental to innovation as they strengthen the economic dominance of rich companies."
"The longer the periods, the less the pressure on companies to seek new solutions and undertake new research."
"In conclusion, despite its many positive features relating mainly to health issues, the REACH regulation does not treat economic entities on an equal footing."
"Nonetheless, this compromise does deserve our support."
"(SV) Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking our rapporteur and my colleague, Mr Sacconi."
"I think I have caused him a few problems throughout the whole process by constantly asking for more: more substitution, more information, the registration of a larger number of chemicals and more sheets guaranteeing the safety of chemical products."
"Guido, thank you for the work you have done and for not losing your sense of humour each time I came up with demands."
"I also want to thank everyone else with whom I have cooperated in the course of the work on REACH."
"Together, we have worked hard in order to obtain just such a strong REACH."
"However, there has been some extremely strong opposition, especially from the political Right here in Parliament and from the chemicals industry."
"The compromise that has now been reached must be judged a success in the light of this tough opposition, in spite of the fact that it does not live up to the demands that I really do think should be made in terms of substitution and information."
"That is because politics is the art of the possible, ladies and gentlemen."
"You cannot obtain everything you want. It is a question, rather, of getting as far as possible down the road you want to travel, and that is what we are doing by means of the compromise that is on the table."
"It is the best we can obtain, and it entails much better rules than the rules governing chemicals that exist in Sweden and the EU at present."
"REACH places the responsibility for testing chemicals on importers and manufacturers."
"We shall obtain more knowledge of, and information about, chemicals, and compliance with the call to replace dangerous substances would improve the current situation."
"There is nothing to suggest that we should obtain a stronger REACH by delaying the process."
"The fact that Germany will be donning the presidential mantle after the New Year and that the German Government, eagerly cheered on by the German chemicals industry, have been the great opponents of a strong REACH is one more reason for avoiding delay."
"We Swedish Social Democrats will therefore be accepting our share of responsibility tomorrow and voting in favour of the compromise."
"We have got as far as we can now, and we must not put what we have achieved at risk by delaying the process."
"In seven years' time, when REACH is up and running, we shall, however, be able to come back and demand that it be further tightened up."
"(DA) Mr President, the chemicals reform has now been designed in terms of total harmonisation, which prohibits the Member States from introducing better protection of people's health and of the environment."
"Thirty-eight Members have tabled amendments calling instead for a minimum directive to be proposed so that the Member States might provide people with the better protection that voters might wish for."
"We have asked for the roll call in order to see who is assuming responsibility for, for example, more cases of cancer and allergies."
"We now have a list of 150 unwanted substances in Denmark."
"They are substances that have harmful effects on health and the environment, and that list can scarcely be maintained in a system involving total harmonisation."
"Protecting the environment and people's health is viewed as distorting competition in the internal market."
"REACH prohibits us not only from banning dangerous substances, but also from warning against them, and REACH will entail further animal experiments on substances that we already know are dangerous or superfluous."
"What we shall thus be voting on on Thursday is a reform that also involves the killing of animals."
"The compromise can only be defended if its rules are minimum ones."
"Couched in terms of total harmonisation, the proposal is too feeble for us."
"Mr President, politics is the art of the possible."
"We should support this hard-won compromise package before us, which will need an open-minded and very honest appraisal at the seven-year review stage."
"After three and a half years, 700 pages of draft proposals and thousands of amendments, it was never going to be easy, with such a complex piece of legislation, to find the right balance between health and environmental objectives while maintaining the competitiveness of European industry."
"Current chemicals regulation is very confusing and inefficient, covering 40 different directives that are more or less independent of each other."
"Witness the saga of the zinc risk assessment that has taken 15 years, to date, and is still not complete."
"REACH will rationalise this system and will register, evaluate and authorise chemicals that were never previously tested for their impact on human health."
"While the legislative debate is coming to an end, the serious challenges of implementing REACH and setting up the agency are only just beginning."
"When it comes into force next year, companies will assume new and, in many cases, onerous responsibilities related to the substances that they manufacture, import, distribute or use."
"This will be particularly challenging for companies that do not already have the expertise to deal with chemicals legislation, especially downstream users of chemicals and the thousands of SMEs that will need to live and survive, Commissioner Verheugen - but I would also add 'thrive' to that list - under REACH."
"However, the Commission, the competent authorities and Member States, the agency and we here in the European Parliament have a role to play in ensuring that REACH is implemented smoothly and effectively."
"The Commission is still developing technical guidance and IT tools that will enable industry and authorities to implement the legislation effectively from the start."
"National helpdesks also need to be set up, either by the competent authorities on their own or in conjunction with industry."
"These preparatory tools must be in place well before the REACH implementation deadline in order to ensure all the necessary support structures are fully operational."
"I agree that this REACH directive will have a very positive influence on standards worldwide."
"Thank you to all concerned."
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Sacconi for his excellent work."
"Without doubt, REACH is by far the most difficult dossier in this parliamentary term."
"I am convinced that our rapporteur achieved the best possible result in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission. The negotiations within Parliament, too, were a very difficult task."
"Anyone who has been listening closely will have noticed that hardly any of the political groupings share the same opinion within their own ranks or represent a clear line."
"One can tell from the criticism that has been expressed how difficult it must be to push a compromise through, even within Parliament."
"Like Mr Sacconi and many other Members of this House, I have always advocated strong worker protection and also strong environmental and consumer protection."
"I would prefer a stricter compromise - incidentally, I made the same comment after the first reading and during the discussion at first reading."
"We now have to decide, however, whether to endorse the compromise - as my group and I shall be doing - or to adopt the Common Position."
"I do not believe that the amendments tabled with the aim of tightening up the Common Position stand a chance of achieving a qualified majority."
"We launched an attempt to go beyond Mr Sacconi's compromise back at first reading, and did not even achieve a simple majority."
"Looking at the positions of many Member States, I wonder what those MEPs are expecting who say that this compromise is a gift to the German chemicals industry."
"Looking at which camp is in the majority in the Council and knowing that, on 1 January 2007, Germany will be taking over the Council Presidency, I ask myself what expectations, if any, we can have of mediation under the leadership of the German Council Presidency."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once more on this result; and I believe that this compromise is a small step in the right direction."
"(EL) Mr President, finally after many years of procedures and negotiations we are very close to adopting a regulation on chemicals."
"Of course, the regulation may not be perfect, but it is very good."
"In the future it can be improved, as has been done with several community directives and regulations."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Sacconi, because in essence this regulation provides for the protection of human health and the environment and this protection will increase over time; moreover, I imagine that, in future, all the substances that cause the concern of most of my colleagues today will be replaced over time."
"It is very good that the regulation provides for control of dangerous substances, where possible."
"It provides for substitution, which must take place, and in cases where there are no substitutes it provides for research plans, which is also very important."
"I would like to remind you that the science of chemistry has offered a lot to the improvement of human life on earth."
"And this was achieved thanks to innovation."
"In essence, this regulation calls for the same thing over time; innovation so that new, better and less dangerous or completely harmless substances can be created to serve man."
"Once again I would like to congratulate Mr Sacconi, because he managed to create a regulation for chemicals, which should not be judged with impatience."
"Do not expect to see perfection as of tomorrow!"
"Over time we will see an essential improvement of public health and the environment."
"(PL) Mr President, one of the main provisions of the draft REACH regulation is the principle of substitution, which remains within the competence of industry."
"This principle could unlock the significant potential for innovation of both the vital chemical industry and the end users of its products."
"Nonetheless, there is considerable scope for the interpretation of certain provisions such as those appearing under 'suitable safer alternatives'."
"The provision concerning enterprises' research and development plans may also prove problematic, as those enterprises that do not have their own research establishment may be exempted from it."
"There is therefore a danger that some small and medium-sized enterprises that do currently have their own research establishments may close them down, and will therefore not be required to submit the aforementioned plans."
"The question arises as to who is responsible for seeking substitutes, the chemical industry or the end user, or whether the responsibility is shared."
"This in turn raises concerns about the nature of intellectual property law in relation to current patent law, which unfortunately is not as good as it could be."
"The carefully formulated principle of substitution is the most logical response to the use of hazardous substances."
"The procedures contained in the regulation aimed at stimulating innovation in the search for new and safe substances are certainly needed."
"(DE) Mr President, the French philosopher Voltaire once said that all fanaticism is dangerous."
"I believe that this debate is a good example of the truth of this statement."
"The words of my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, of those from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group or even of the extreme left give me the impression that only losers could endorse a package such as this."
"Yet let us compare the advantages of REACH with the disadvantages. It must be made clear in this regard that REACH represents a step in the right direction for us all: greater environmental and consumer protection, but also greater competitiveness."
"Rejecting REACH would undoubtedly be detrimental to all sides, therefore."
"For this reason, it will now be up to us to communicate this properly."
"Indeed, to look at the media, one would think that there were no winners."
"Our skill will now be judged on how effectively we can change this impression."
"After all, in the final analysis, human beings, animals and even the environment are the big winners from this legislation."
"We should continue to work on it, therefore."
"In this regard, I must also remind the media of their duty, which is to communicate a true image of this new legislation, particularly at the present stage."
"The second stage will consist of getting the implementation of this image right - which will also be very difficult, as we know the scenario: the EU is always to blame."
"From the point of view of legal form, however, this legislation is a directive and therefore needs to be implemented by the Member States, who will have to implement and also apply it correctly."
"All parties really face great challenges in this regard."
"The appeal goes out to us, too: let us create a strong Agency for all this, so that we have uniform rules rather than another patchwork of 25 or 27 different regimes."
"We have considerable work to do, therefore, and hopes for a REACH-free year in 2007 are unlikely to be fulfilled."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us see how far we have come with the project before us today."
"REACH will change our relationship to chemical pollution considerably, by reversing the burden of proof, first of all; then by systematically providing information all down the line."
"A previous speaker mentioned the asbestos scandal."
"We are well aware that a scandal of that kind would be impossible with the text we are voting on today."
"The public needs to know that."
"There are all these gains, it is true, but there are of course also things with which we are not satisfied, or not satisfied enough, starting with natural substances: I would have liked us to be a little clearer, as it may cause problems."
"I do not think a natural substance is really a chemical substance."
"As regards imports, I would also have liked us to have more guarantees that we can impose similar standards on importers."
"Then, obviously, there is this major issue of substitution."
"Like many of you, I, too, would have liked substitution to be automatic, systematic and immediate."
"At first reading, I voted in favour of all the amendments to that end, but I noticed that we do not have the qualified majority."
"If Mr Sacconi had not managed to reach this compromise, we would be taking a great risk, at the vote on the second reading, of not having this principle implemented."
"After all, it must be said that the compromise does include the principle."
"What is in question is not the principle but its gradual, progressive implementation, - inadequate in my opinion - but the principle exists for all dangerous substances."
"Let us not therefore overlook the effort our fellow Member has made and the victory we have achieved on that front."
"Now, having established the principle, we are going to have to see that it is adequately implemented."
"That will depend on the Agency's resources - financial resources, human resources - on pressure from the public and on the amount of money that will be devoted to research."
"Furthermore, on this point, we want the Commission to be particularly proactive in ensuring that this compromise leads to all the progress we are hoping for."
"(HU) After three years of debates, we have reached the point where we can give a final judgment on the draft law known as REACH."
"Several options are on offer for the vote on Wednesday."
"One: we could support the Council's common position."
"Two: we can reject the entire proposal."
"Three: we can accept the compromise package, and thus bring REACH into existence."
"The first and most important question is whether we need new legislation at all, or whether the laws currently in force are adequate for resolving our concerns for environmental protection and human and animal health, and ensuring that the desired amount of information is made available."
"In other words, do we need new legislation in order to find out more about the 30 000 chemicals which surround us every day?"
"The answer is a resounding yes."
"We need new, comprehensive regulations, within the framework of which the large-scale, often postponed review of chemicals can be carried out."
"The other important question is whether the compromise that has been reached is good enough."
"Are the solutions that have been reached better than those of the first reading, or has the legislation simply been diluted and further weakened in the course of the six 'trialogues'?"
"Let us address these questions one by one: what were our most important goals after the first reading?"
"We wanted a stronger and stricter substitution, and we have got it."
"We wanted to make stricter rules governing manufacturers' responsibility, and we have made them."
"We wanted to restrict animal testing, and we have done so."
"We wanted a stricter, but practicable registration, and we have achieved it."
"We wanted the OSOR principle to prevail and to support SMEs, and this too, we have achieved."
"All in all, we can say that the compromise package is much better than the one put forward at first reading; we have fought successfully for a stronger and even stricter REACH."
"Ladies and gentlemen, for these reasons, the conclusion cannot be other than to support the compromise."
"(DA) Mr President, there are approximately 100 000 chemicals on the market."
"We have no knowledge of by far the majority of these chemicals at present."
"We do not know what effects they have on the environment and on health."
"That, clearly, is completely unacceptable, but it is a state of affairs that we are now tackling by means of REACH, for REACH introduces two basic principles."
"Firstly, we are reversing the burden of proof so that, in the future, it will be up to the industry to show that a substance is safe before it can be given permission to market it, whereas, at present, it is up to the authorities to show that a substance is dangerous before they are entitled to ban it."
"The second basic principle, and the absolutely most important one, is that the most dangerous substances of all - those that give people cancer and allergies and that affect people's reproductive ability etc - are to be substituted."
"If there is an alternative substance that is safer, it must be used instead of the dangerous substance."
"That is a very important basic principle."
"It is also gratifying that, in future, less use will be made of experiments on animals."
"Implementing REACH would lead to far fewer such experiments."
"In the short term, there would be quite a few experiments, because we should need to use some data that we do not have at present, but, in the long term, REACH would result in far fewer experiments because of the introduction of compulsory data sharing, which is definitely also an aspect worth including."
"All of us have been influenced in this business by many different interest groups."
"That much is obvious."
"There are major interests at stake, and things could not be otherwise."
"There have been the green organisations, on the one hand, and the chemicals organisations and their industry, on the other."
"The question is, what is the nature of the compromise we have obtained? Has the game ended in a draw, as I saw one newspaper article assert?"
"No, it has not."
"We have ended up not with a draw but with a compromise, in which it is clearly the green interests that have won."
"It is clearly environmental and health considerations that have won."
"In the past we had an open stable door, with the result that a variety of chemicals could, without further ado, be placed on the market and used as one saw fit."
"That door has almost been closed."
"The door is not completely secure inasmuch as there is still a small chink in it. In an ideal world we should, of course, have sealed this, but we do not live in an ideal world."
"We have achieved a compromise, which is good for the environment and people's health."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a long debate on the greatest legislative initiative this Parliament has ever had to come to grips with."
"My compliments to Mr Sacconi on his work."
"As the previous speakers have demonstrated, the text may be voluminous, but it remains open to a very broad interpretation."
"This proposal bears the clear imprint of Parliament."
"There has been a marked change in the world of chemicals and the faith in their safety since Seveso and Bhopal."
"The fact that all the previous speakers welcome the compromise only with reservations is proof that it is relatively balanced."
"Now, however, the Council and the Commission are called upon to start up a functional, powerful Agency as quickly as possible."
"This will cost money and generate red tape."
"The Agency is the key to the functioning of REACH."
"The recruitment of sufficient numbers of the relevant experts represents a challenge."
"The Agency must work quickly, accurately and without making mistakes so as to improve the reputation of REACH as a model for other states and associations of states."
"In my opinion, the issue of intellectual property has been sufficiently regulated."
"We shall have to monitor carefully whether we can live with the present form of substitution in the long run, and we shall have to monitor just as carefully the strain the legislative procedure puts on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Only when all aspects are equally successful will REACH have met the requirements arising from the Lisbon process."
"REACH must not degenerate into a typecase that is still not full even after two or three decades;"
"Europe will have to be judged on its implementability."
"With regard to the overlapping fields, I would make a plea for the deletion of medical devices, as these rules are congruous and adequate in themselves, and leaving medical devices in would mean incalculable delays in the authorisation of medicinal products."
"We shall consider in due course whether the present function of REACH is adequate, and whether the rules are too strict or too lax."
"We must not use comitology to withdraw from involvement in further developments, but rather must monitor application regularly and with a critical eye."
"(ET) I would like to greet our rapporteur Mr Sacconi and congratulate him on his good work and his cogency during the numerous negotiations."
"The path that led to this result has been far from easy, but in the end everything we desired has successfully been achieved, by which I mean not only instruments for authorisation and substitution, but also, to a certain extent, compulsory registration."
"The legislative framework of REACH is one of the most substantial ever created by the European Union; it may even be one of the most voluminous of any debated in any parliament anywhere in the world."
"REACH serves a greater objective in Europe, and in the future will set a good example for the rest of the world."
"When one considers the Commission's recommendation and the Council's initial position, Parliament's report has come a long way."
"What is, perhaps, most important is that the substitution process will come to include all dangerous substances that are prohibited or have a limited validity permit, with the obligation to plan substitution or, if that is not possible, to develop alternatives."
"The law's achievements are the result of active work in Parliament over the last three and a half years."
"My own country, Estonia, was not one of the negotiators in the initial phase of the process, but I followed the process that led to the compromises with great interest, and so I would like to emphatically congratulate Parliament for the compromise that has been achieved, and say that I really do hope that the national parliaments will follow our example."
"I hope that the compromise package will be accepted at Wednesday's vote in the same form which was agreed upon during the preliminary work."
"This would improve the quality of life of the citizens of Europe and serve as a stimulus for small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs with new and high standards for environmental sustainability, which would make our industrial sector more innovative and competitive."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Borrell, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and all those involved in the lengthy and difficult drafting of this text."
"Certainly it contains more positive than negative points but I deplore the fact that no chemical safety report will be required for the 17 000 substances produced in amounts of one to ten tonnes. There is no doubt that the compromise we reached on the authorisation chapter represented a last-ditch effort at reaching an agreement."
"In relation to CMRs, however, substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, the process of proper control, which has been retained, is acceptable, apart from the fact that the agreement, which stipulates that the presentation of a research and development plan will be obligatory without at the same time extending the obligation to implementing any such plan, weakens the text."
"Consequently, a revision will be needed in six years."
"In the general context of the increase in certain types of cancer and reduction in fertility, surely we have a collective ethical responsibility to follow the precautionary principle, especially in relation to hormone disruptors?"
"In spite of the improvements made to the Commission's text, let us remember that REACH will allow the European chemical industry to keep its place as leader on the world market, that REACH will make a quite new contribution to restoring the confidence of consumers and that the changes to REACH will make it possible to improve the weaknesses in the system."
"Mr President, the ball is now in the court of the Commission and the Member States, who will have to see to it that the Agency is operational as soon as possible."
"Mr President, in the course of this debate, some speakers from the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups used some intemperate language in relation to Mr Sacconi, members of the PSE Group and others."
"It obliges me to put some political realities to them."
"Firstly, the Sacconi package is better than the current regulatory system that we have in place."
"It is better than the Council's common position."
"If they succeed in defeating it by amending it and the possibility that we end up back at square one, then effectively that puts the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups in the pockets of some of the dirtiest and most backward chemical industries in Europe."
"We want to make progress in this Parliament, not go backwards."
"The strength of Europe and of this Parliament is in identifying the threads of consensus on an issue."
"I think that Mr Sacconi, his staff and all the other Members of this Parliament who have participated in this process have successfully identified the thread of consensus and built on it and we have made progress in regulating the chemical industry in Europe."
"We do not all have everything we would like; but as long as there are divergent views on how we can achieve a clean, healthy environment in Europe, on how we can control these things, we will have the democratic process to help us to find a solution."
"I heartily recommend the Sacconi package and congratulate him and all associated with it."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally after a lengthy and extremely difficult procedure, we are facing a solution regarding the regulation on registering, evaluating and licensing of chemical substances."
"The said regulation is a unique opportunity for all of us to achieve a high level of public health and environmental protection, both for us but also for future generations."
"I would like to express my support for the solution that Mr Sacconi achieved, to whom we owe congratulations."
"Maybe we did want more strict rules or a regulation with broader applications."
"What we must note though, is that the primary goal is to activate as soon as possible the control system for dangerous substances, even if there are still issues that need redefinition in the future."
"By adopting REACH, the existing legal framework on control of dangerous chemical substances will be strengthened in order to protect the health of European citizens, while at the same time it will boost competitiveness of European industry through innovation and research for the development of safer chemical substances."
"REACH is a new, realistic proposal, which we all ought to support by continuing to work on improving it."
"We should not send REACH back into the hallways, where it was for so many years, in order for it to become more environmentally friendly and more socialist in nature."
"(CS) The negotiated compromise is neither a disaster for European industry, nor a wasted opportunity to improve healthcare for half a billion Europeans."
"It is indicative of the desire among MEPs and the EU-25 to find balanced solutions that represent ways forward, rather than barriers, and for this they deserve plaudits, not criticism."
"The regulation, in this administratively streamlined version, will undoubtedly bring fresh bureaucracy, for which the Union will be criticised."
"This is a clear levy that Europeans will have to pay for getting what they want, namely more detailed information on chemicals in products."
"We shall see how this influences consumer behaviour."
"I am certain that such information, which costs a great deal of money, will provide fresh impetus for European research into developing useful substitutes and, where the regulation does not provide for substitutes, will safeguard the gradual, natural elimination of various harmful substances from products."
"Doctors will continue to carry out strict checks on dangerous substances and rightly so."
"Nothing comes for free, however, and industry is therefore right to defend itself against higher costs."
"We still cannot overlook the influence on competitiveness and unemployment in the Union for which politicians such as ourselves - and not doctors or industry - are responsible."
"One serious shortcoming that I should once again like to highlight is the fact that the new system is solely European, and not global."
"Accordingly, despite its undoubted benefits, REACH will place the tightly regulated European economy at a disadvantage in the context of liberalised world trade."
"Indeed for this very reason, it offers consumers no protection from the dangers concealed in products from third countries, especially given that the unemployed will buy cheap products, legally or otherwise."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the 27 Member States to ensure that European regulations match our ambitions on the world stage, because this is our political responsibility."
"It is our duty to try and raise environmental, safety and social standards in manufacturing, both in the Union and in third countries."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Sacconi for accomplishing such a long, hard and difficult task so well."
"I would also like to thank the Finnish Presidency."
"I am delighted it was under this Presidency that we finally managed to complete the intense work on the development of this regulation."
"It has taken a very long time, eight years to be precise, and the fact that nobody is entirely happy with the outcome actually means that the REACH regulation can be adopted."
"The chemical industry feels that REACH is overly favourable to the environment."
"Environmentalists allege that the regulation was written to suit industry."
"This suggests that a compromise was reached which is feasible in view of current social and political conditions."
"I wish to make only two further points."
"Firstly, if we cast a critical eye over the REACH regulation, we are bound to recognise that this is a single document replacing the 40 different regulations currently in place, and that it will enable us to effectively protect human life and health."
"Secondly, this regulation is a distinct improvement on what has existed to date."
"If we resolve to continue improving and amending it in the future, I believe we should adopt it."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the EU is often referred to as an incompetent, useless institution that, following enlargement, has become incapable of taking the important, effective joint decisions that are vital for Europe."
"I firmly believe that today's debate and the vote on Wednesday on the REACH Directive will be evidence that the exact opposite is true."
"The drafting and adoption of the REACH legislation represents a step of both Europe-wide and worldwide significance."
"With this legislation, Europe will be creating clear, transparent and fair rules for registering, assessing, authorising and, where necessary, restricting the use of chemicals."
"In their final form, these rules will result in the greater protection of public health and the environment, and will enable the European chemicals industry not only to survive, but also, in my view, to strengthen its position in the world."
"This is because, through the REACH legislation, it is Europe that will in future determine the rules, standards and trends for the chemicals industry throughout the world."
"As with all legislation, REACH represents a compromise, in this case between representatives of the chemicals industry, consumers, environmentalists and animal welfare groups."
"It also represents a compromise between the representatives of large chemical firms and SMEs."
"Speaking as an MEP from the Czech Republic, a medium-sized country in which SMEs dominate chemical production, I am sure that, once the initial costs have been absorbed, the REACH legislation will enable the consolidation and further development of these SMEs, including the creation of more and more jobs."
"I shall therefore be voting in favour of the REACH Directive in Wednesday's vote."
"(HU) Fellow Members, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur and all those who have helped and perfected his work with their questions and their support over the past years."
"I would like to underline that for us, representatives from the Eastern European states, this is a legislative project that in two important instances expresses our own proposals made in committee debates and successfully incorporated into Parliament as well."
"One is the Maltese-Slovenian proposal, the other the Hungarian-British, so-called OSOR initiative."
"This in itself makes possible savings of 10 billion Ft for Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is further proof that we have managed to harmonise the health and environmental protection considerations with the small entrepreneur's cost-bearing capability."
"Therefore, I would like to welcome this compromise."
"As a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am especially pleased that the requirement of providing consumer information was finally built into the compromise proposal."
"I believe this will be very important to all participants, since this will allow us to assess the results of REACH."
"I sincerely hope that all the work we have accomplished in the course of lawmaking will not be undone during implementation."
"My congratulations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding all the positions that have been voiced, even the most critical ones, and those who are preparing to vote for the common position, without supporting a package that improves it, I should just like to say that there is freedom in this Parliament and that we shall remain on good terms as before."
"There is, however, an argument that I have to demolish."
"Somebody spoke of hundreds of dangerous substances that would be freely released on the market, and someone even said that 90% of dangerous substances would be authorised: in other words, the compromise puts in place a kind of licence to kill."
"All this distortion is supposed to have happened during the last night of negotiations."
"That is not true."
"I can only give you an estimate, because only REACH will tell us the actual numbers, but the most reliable estimates say that roughly 2 500 substances will be subject to the authorisation procedure."
"With the compromise, there should be less than 200 substances that can be authorised on the basis of adequate control - which is not a licence to kill, but involves a risk assessment."
"In any case, because of the way in which we have restructured the compromise, even for these substances a substitution plan must necessarily be submitted where an alternative exists, or a research and development plan where there is no alternative."
"Nobody, therefore, can deny the fact that all substances that are authorised will be included in a process that sooner or later will lead to their substitution."
"If anyone was thinking that substitution would be made compulsory by decree, they would be voting on something that I have never put forward, either at first reading or in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"What I really cannot accept is what has been said about the negotiating process having been non-transparent and undemocratic."
"I met the shadow rapporteurs before and after all the negotiating rounds; I kept them informed; and, right up to the last round, there was very broad agreement on the negotiating mandate that I took to the negotiating table."
"Lastly, I should like to thank my friend Carl Schlyter for having returned the apple from a year ago."
"I shall eat it tomorrow."
"He, however, kept it, and he showed me something in a glass jar that is a real ecological disaster in the making."
"Still in the fruit and vegetable department, I should like to tell you something that I was taught by my old trade union negotiating master."
"He was an old worker who had been through a lot and had made plenty of sacrifices."
"He told me, 'You must not be like a walnut, which is hard on the outside and soft inside; you have to be like a peach, soft on the outside and hard inside.'"
"That is the negotiating line that I follow."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for a very interesting and very open debate."
"There has been some pretty frank talk here."
"The discussion showed that there is still a range of views on REACH in Parliament, and why should there not be?"
"In my opinion, it is very understandable and natural that that should be the case."
"On the other hand, the debate showed that very many Members of Parliament are prepared to seek the best outcome possible in this situation through compromise."
"It appears that the wish that I expressed in my first speech will come true in the vote the day after tomorrow on Wednesday."
"It would seem that there is now a sufficient number who desire a compromise."
"I am certain and convinced that the result of these compromises is that we in the European Union will have the most progressive legislation on chemicals in the world."
"After the voting has taken place, the serious work will then begin: the Regulation's implementation."
"The practical work will start on the control of the 30 000 chemicals now on the European markets."
"I believe that this work will mean that we will be doing our children, our grandchildren, nature, the environment and everywhere we live a great service."
"With these words, then, once and for all I want to thank the Members of Parliament, and the rapporteur especially, as well as the Chairman of the Committee and our partners more generally in Parliament and the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make just two brief comments."
"Some of the participants in this debate, who I can no longer see here at the moment, have expressed the criticism that the REACH project would reduce the level of protection for employees in the chemicals industry."
"I can state conclusively that that is pure nonsense."
"REACH cannot reduce the level of protection in the chemicals industry."
"The relevant provisions on worker protection remain in full force."
"REACH does not permit anything that was previously prohibited."
"Quite on the contrary, employees will no longer be expected to deal with a whole string of substances for which they were previously responsible."
"At all events, therefore, REACH brings about a clear improvement in the safety of employees in the workplace."
"Therefore, I must reject unambiguously this argument on the part of Members of Parliament who are acting as though they are representatives of workers' interests."
"My second point is that many speakers have rightly pointed out that the important thing now is to implement REACH fully as well as transparently, resolutely and with the avoidance of unnecessary red tape."
"This requires an endless number of initiatives, projects and measures - I could list them all to the House, but there is not enough time."
"I have already spoken to the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and offered to visit the committee in February and present a detailed report on the measures the Commission has either already taken or plans to take with regard to the implementation of REACH."
"At the same time, I should like to attach particular importance to answering all the questions that have been asked here about support for European SMEs and a relaxation of the requirements imposed on them, and about the many hundreds of thousands of employees affected."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches of the distinguished Members of the European Parliament and I appreciate the positive and constructive contributions and the well-intentioned criticisms."
"The Commission supports the compromise amendments, which, on the one hand, aim to make significant improvements in the protection of human health and the environment and, on the other, to enhance innovation and maintain economic growth."
"I believe that one of the most important elements of the agreement we have on the table, as Mrs Corbey underlined, is the substitution of the most dangerous substances with safer alternatives when these are available."
"I can say that in certain aspects this compromise is an improvement compared with the original Commission proposal, for example the authorisation in general is stricter."
"I can fully support making it obligatory for companies' applications for authorisation to include substitution plans for substances of very high concern - manufactured or imported - if the companies have identified the availability of suitable alternatives."
"I can also fully agree that these substitution plans should be key factors in the decision to grant authorisations and in any further revision of such authorisations."
"The vote last October in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety may have raised hopes for an even more ambitious result, as Mr Bowis said."
"Like many of the speakers this evening, I would also like to stay at the top of the mountain and would have preferred certain issues to have been dealt with differently in the final deal."
"For example, as Mr Davies and Mrs Hassi have underlined, the rules on substances which disturb the hormone system - the so-called endocrine disruptors - could be stricter."
"Mrs Lucas and others do not accept that the possibility to keep the scientific names of new dangerous substances confidential for six years would be beneficial to the overall deal."
"This denies consumers the right to know which substances they are dealing with and it also makes it more difficult for users to identify the substances in various databases."
"Last but not least, as Mrs Ek, Mrs Ferreira, and others have suggested, the obligation to provide a chemical safety report for the most dangerous substances in the lower production volumes would have been useful to further enhance worker protection."
"Nevertheless, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt underlined, a compromise is a compromise and this compromise package is a marked improvement for the protection of health and the environment if we compare it to the current situation."
"The Commission can fully support the compromise package and I sincerely hope that Parliament will support this package during the vote on Wednesday."
"Throughout this process the Commission has done its best to facilitate agreement between the Council and Parliament and to find balanced compromises."
"We very much welcome the convergence developed between Parliament and the Council and fully support this agreement so that REACH can be enforced by June 2007."
"Once again, I am grateful to Mr Sacconi and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts to achieve this compromise."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Community Customs Code - Customs 2013 programme (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the reports:"
"by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) C6-0419/2005, and"
"by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013) C6-0158/2006."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as well as the other committees involved, and in particular Mrs Fourtou as rapporteur for the reports to be discussed tonight."
"The modernisation of the European customs environment is an essential contribution to attaining the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is a must if we want the European Union to remain an attractive place to do business and maintain the external competitiveness of EU companies."
"In this context, it is crucial to deepen the single market by making the EU a fully-integrated customs territory."
"This reform is also critical if we want to live up to the challenges of globalisation and reinforce the role of customs in protecting our citizens and companies from security and safety hazards such as counterfeiting, dangerous goods or the devices of international terrorism."
"The modernised Community Customs Code will provide the legal framework for the development of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade based on the best use of information and communication technology."
"The present Community Customs Code was adapted in 1992."
"Since then, it has undergone only limited changes."
"This means that the Code has not kept pace with the radical changes to the environment in which customs and traders operate, particularly in respect of the rapid and irreversible adoption of electronic data exchange."
"The Customs Code has to be adapted to fit the electronic environment."
"In addition, it is commonly held by customs authorities and traders alike that current customs procedure and processes are unnecessarily complicated."
"They also do not reflect the changing focus of customs work, moving from the collection of declining customs duties towards the application of non-tariff measures. This includes, in particular, security and safety measures, the fight against counterfeiting, money laundering and drugs and the application of sanitary, health and consumer protection measures."
"With your support, the proposal for a modernised Customs Code on the table tonight, together with the proposals on the Council table and e-customs, will make customs work better, faster and more cheaply."
"Let me once again and now more specifically turn to Mrs Fourtou and the Committee on the Internal Market for their detailed and most valuable assessment of the Commission's proposal for a modernised Customs Code."
"I know there is unanimous support in the Committee on the Internal Market for the rapporteur's recommendations."
"Progress in the Council is complementing your work."
"I am pleased to report that on 4 December the Competitiveness Council showed a keen interest in the key elements of the reform."
"Ministers gave strong support to the Commission's proposals on the single window, on centralised clearance and on customs agents, while inviting the Commission to pursue the work to implement these in an acceptable manner for all Member States."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on these three issues, but I must also inform you that in at least one of them the Commission's position remains unchanged."
"Thus it is the Commission's firm opinion that the accreditation of professional customs agents is not a matter for the Customs Code."
"There is a future for the profession in an open competitive market, through self-regulation and the recognition provided by the status of authorised economic operator."
"Though there is no debate on the e-customs proposal tonight, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur Mr Heaton-Harris and the Committee on the Internal Market for its full support for an extremely ambitious Commission proposal."
"It is indeed challenging to propose that all Member States and the Commission commit themselves to developing common electronic systems for customs proposals by an agreed date."
"Let me stress that the firm support from Parliament is more than welcome in order to convince Member States that, despite budgetary constraints, they need to develop their customs IT system in a Community framework."
"I am confident that the Council will acknowledge this step and the proposal can soon be adopted."
"I very much appreciate the efforts of the European Parliament and particularly those of Mrs Fourtou to come to an agreement in a single reading on the Customs 2013 proposal."
"This will definitely ensure the continuity of the programme activities as of 1 January 2008."
"The speedy adoption of Customs 2013 shows that there is a broad agreement across all the institutions on the obvious need to guarantee the effective functioning of the internal market in the customs field."
"Indeed, the customs environment is undergoing major changes."
"The Customs 2013 programme will be an essential instrument to ensure efficient cooperation and coordination between all customs administrations."
"It will facilitate the introduction of new trans-European computerised systems, reinforce networks between customs officials and promote and establish common training modules."
"Once the two customs proposals under debate and the e-customs proposal are finally adopted by both Parliament and the Council, they will enable the customs services of the EU to meet the major challenges."
"They will facilitate international trade, foster simpler control and will more effectively protect the internal market and the health, safety and security of our citizens through more efficient control."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'modernised Customs Code', 'paperless Customs', 'Customs 2013 programme', these three reports that we are discussing in this session demonstrate the growing importance of customs and their role in the European Union's desire for competitiveness and efficiency."
"These three reports are closely linked but, in the interests of greater clarity, I shall first present the modernised Customs Code and then move on to the Customs 2013 programme."
"The Customs Code - as you said, Mr Kovacs - dates from 1992."
"It was legitimate to modernise it in order to adapt it to the evolving range of tasks undertaken by Customs and the radical changes that have taken place in international trade."
"It is a matter of rationalising customs procedures by laying the foundations of customs clearance systems that are accessible and interoperable within the European Union."
"That is why this proposal is accompanied by a proposal for a decision on electronic customs, for which Mr Heaton-Harris is the rapporteur."
"The new Code includes 200 articles and we have concentrated on the principal points, or at least the most controversial points, that is, the customs representative, the authorised economic operator, centralised customs clearance and comitology."
"Article 11 is concerned with the customs representative."
"Until now, national legislation has made it possible to reserve the right of representation to a professional category."
"In the context of the Single Market and the electronic environment, however, there is no longer any grounds for this monopoly."
"Furthermore, some businesses are able to have an integrated service that takes care of customs formalities."
"The right to customs representation, therefore, must be open to all."
"Nonetheless, in many Member States, using a customs agent is traditional and remains very useful for small businesses."
"That is why, without wishing to retain a monopoly, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted an amendment that, among the criteria for the status of customs representative, provides for recognition of the existence of practical standards of competence or professional qualifications in order to satisfy those Member States for whom the abolition of this monopoly is difficult to accept."
"We have not yet found the ideal solution and this question will certainly be raised again at second reading because certain delegations within the Council are still expressing reservations and going so far as to demand regulated access to the profession."
"The authorised economic operator was introduced into the Customs Code by means of Regulation 648 of 13 April 2005, known as the 'security regulation'."
"This statute is not yet properly in existence because the provisions for its implementation have just been adopted by the Commission."
"The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has introduced a clarification, making a clear distinction between the 'customs simplification' Authorised Economic Operator, and the 'security and safety' Authorised Economic Operator."
"Centralised customs clearance is a facilitation that, in principle, has been well received but the Member States are wondering about the collection of customs duties."
"The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted a fairly radical position in demanding that electronic customs clearance operations should be free of charge and that customs-offices should be open 24 hours a day."
"Indeed, in the interests of fair competition between national customs authorities, the rule must apply to all."
"It is necessary, however, to ensure that there is harmonisation of the checking processes."
"Finally, the provisions in the proposal make constant reference to comitology."
"This procedure is necessary because reference needs to be made to experts to establish the provisions for implementation of the Code."
"In accordance with the new interinstitutional agreement of July 2006, certain provisions of the Code are subject to the new procedure for comitology with scrutiny."
"Therefore, having sought the opinion of the European Parliament's legal service, we have adopted, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, amendments that are aimed at adapting the comitology procedure corresponding to the different articles."
"The Committee on International Trade adopted amendments for the codecision procedure for certain provisions that would normally fall within their competence by virtue of the strengthened cooperation procedure."
"We considered, however, that its position was contrary to that of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and we had to reject those amendments."
"Those then, very briefly, are the main points of the report and, as I said just now, it is very closely linked with the report concerning the Customs 2013 programme."
"Reading the mid-term evaluation of the Customs 2007 programme has demonstrated that this programme is well adapted to the needs of administrations and that it plays a crucial role in helping participating countries to share their experiences."
"This evaluation recommended strengthening the activities carried out in the field of training and information exchange."
"The programme has a budget of EUR 322.8 million over a period of six years and its aim is to help the customs administrations of the participating countries to encourage legitimate exchanges, to simplify and speed up customs procedures and to ensure the safety and security of citizens and the financial interests of the Community."
"The amendments adopted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection are in line with the work of the Council and I wish to thank the Finnish Presidency in particular because, in order to satisfy the European Parliament's legitimate budgetary demands, it has on many occasions negotiated with Member States and defended our position."
"Therefore, we shall be able, I hope, to conclude this matter at first reading."
"The reports concerning customs are eminently technical and complicated."
"That is why I wish to thank most warmly the various people I have spoken to within the Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union who have always responded to my every request and allowed me to tackle these subjects more easily."
"I thank also my fellow Members and the Chairman of our Committee for their help and support."
"At a time when trade is speeding up, when organised crime and counterfeiting threaten our security and our market, customs and economic operators need our full support."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, Commissioner, I wish to congratulate you on the important work that you and your services have accomplished in the interests of modernisation of customs legislation, which is a necessary condition for the good functioning of our internal market."
"I should like also to warmly congratulate Mrs Fourtou who made some very useful proposals for improvement."
"With regard to international trade, I shall make three comments concerning questions of competence between committees, comitology and, lastly, the parliamentary dimension in international trade."
"I think, Mr President, that there must be an end to rivalry over competence between the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on International Trade or, at the very least, these rivalries must not delay the adoption of European legislation that our internal market so desperately needs."
"It is not sensible to deny the link between international trade and the issue of Community customs."
"At a time when Europe is being closely watched, I regret that Rule 47 of our Rules of Procedure has been violated in respect of strengthened cooperation between committees, because the amendments voted for unanimously by the Committee on International Trade have been brushed aside in an irregular manner and will not, alas, be put to the vote in plenary."
"I am delighted, however, that our amendments have brought to light an abusive use of comitology procedures by the European Commission."
"I hope that, in the end, it will be forced to use the new comitology procedure with scrutiny, which came out of the interinstitutional agreement of July 2006."
"On that subject, it will be important to clarify the use of Article 194(c), and the European Commission will have to assure us that it does not intend to modify the Community Customs Code according to an international trade agreement concluded by it under Article 133 of the Treaty on European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the failure of the Doha agenda harms the rules of international trade, we must protect our producers and our consumers from security and safety problems thanks to border controls."
"In this context, never has the parliamentary dimension of international trade been so important, particularly in relation to the functioning of Community customs."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members who have cooperated on this difficult dossier; above all Mrs Fourtou, who has fought her way through this complex set of rules with great success."
"The rapporteur for our group, Mr Heaton-Harris, unfortunately cannot be here today, and so, as the coordinator with competence for this dossier, I shall be speaking on his behalf and that of the group today, if I may."
"The Community Customs Code is an extremely important project, which will remove persisting hurdles in the European internal market and, particularly with regard to piracy and intellectual property, has global significance."
"For example, it enables centralised clearance at an enterprise's headquarters, which is important to the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, in particular."
"I think that this report on the Modernised Customs Code helps to simplify existing customs procedures and will also help to improve the competitiveness of European enterprises."
"I should like to focus on just a few points."
"From the outset, one critical point was Article 14 on authorised economic operators, about which Mrs Fourtou has spoken."
"I think that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has reached a good compromise on this, one which gives these persons greater freedom in the performance of their activities."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will therefore withdraw its Amendment 57 and support the compromise reached in the Committee on Internal Market."
"This compromise makes clear that we want our enterprises to enjoy greater freedom, and we should also communicate to the outside world that the regulations of the Modernised Customs Code have been drawn up for our enterprises and in their favour."
"The Community Customs Code will not be an obstacle to greater competitiveness."
"Finally, I should like to highlight and champion the amendment to Article 125 that was tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris on behalf of our group."
"This article enables Member States to introduce simplifications beyond the scope of the Customs Code, within the framework of bilateral or multinational agreements."
"The old Customs Code already included the possibility of closer cooperation, and so this possibility is already being used in practice."
"It would be detrimental to our enterprises if we were to now abolish this framework, and I believe that that also accords well with the thoughts of Mr Audy."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I have the feeling that, with regard to this issue, disputes amongst MEPs, as such, have been kept to a minimum, particularly with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats having withdrawn its Amendment 57."
"I believe that Mrs Fourtou and the Commission's services in the TAXUD Directorate-General have done a wonderful job and have explained an issue that appeared to be complex in a very clear fashion, but we still have a few amendments that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is insisting on presenting."
"I believe that the first group of amendments raises no difficulties, since it involves adapting the comitology proposals to the new comitology agreement between Parliament and the other institutions."
"With regard to the other amendments, there are still certain issues outstanding, such as the issue of representatives at customs."
"A significant proportion of Members of this House, at least, believe that customs activities require a degree of professional dedication and cannot be replaced with an abstract freedom to carry out customs activities."
"There are too many considerations of a personnel nature, including security considerations, which make this a legitimate profession that must be maintained and must not be eliminated on the basis of a liberalisation theory that has nothing to do with reality."
"The amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the economic operators authorised and also, particularly for consumers and citizens, on free electronic customs processing and the twenty-four hour provision of these services, also seem to me to be positive."
"I believe that it would be a good thing to simplify customs procedures, which are usually very complex and which hinder the internal market."
"I - like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in general - am therefore in favour of the amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I believe that Mr Audy is absolutely right to raise the issue of comitology, but I believe that, in accordance with the reports that we have received from the legal services, the only possible solution is the one adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and that the problem is not one of confrontation amongst committees but, rather, one of our all having to adjust to this situation, in view of the current reality."
"I do not therefore believe that there is any kind of problem between the two committees."
"In short, Mr President, we are in agreement with Mrs Fourtou's report;"
"I believe that we could reach an agreement very quickly amongst the three institutions in order to approve the two reports, and we hope that this Parliament will approve the amendments from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs without any great difficulty."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I should firstly like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, for the splendid job she has done."
"In general, there is no rule without its exceptions, and that is a good thing."
"Our European Union does not consist only of Member States that should be covered in full by the Community's customs regulations."
"The EU also consists of territories that, for historical and other reasons, have in different ways been forced to place themselves outside the Community's harmonisation of indirect taxation."
"Such territories include the Åland Islands, which belong to Finland, the Channel Islands, the Canaries, Agios Oros in Greece and the overseas French departments."
"It is important for both the European Union and its territories that trade between them be able to take place as smoothly as possible."
"Because these territories are very different even from each other in terms of their trade with the European Union, it is important that it be made possible to introduce special exemptions for them."
"This would benefit the European Union and our efforts to achieve the objectives in terms of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Special arrangements for these areas would not disrupt trade within the Community, and we should, of course, all benefit from the smooth flow of trade and from the fact that unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles had not been erected."
"I am therefore pleased that, in its report, the committee has taken note of this need and adopted a pragmatic approach."
"My hope now is that the Council and the Commission too will meet Parliament half way on these points."
"Bilateral arrangements too must be possible in certain cases."
"It is important for the EU to respond to the population's special needs and not to get hung up on standard solutions that are appropriate for many but not for everyone."
"I am pleased that the reform of the Customs Code can also help strengthen people's confidence in the EU, which has, of course, seriously wavered recently."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Parliament and Council Regulation laying down the Community Customs Code is a document amounting to a thorough modernisation of the Customs Code in force since 1992."
"This modernisation is required in view of the radical changes that have taken place in the area of international trade."
"Accordingly, the regulation aims to simplify customs legislation and procedure."
"It is designed to benefit commercial entities and customs administrations, to reduce the cost of customs formalities and to respond to commercial challenges involving safety and protection, detecting counterfeiting and money laundering and also protecting health and the environment."
"The new Community Customs Code goes beyond simplifying certain procedures."
"Fundamental changes in Customs legislation have been undertaken in a number of areas."
"This document is inextricably linked to the report on computerisation of Customs procedures."
"The decision taken by Parliament and the Council concerning an electronic environment for customs authorities and traders provides for the creation and application of safe, interoperable and accessible electronic customs systems which should simplify and improve flow along the supply chain and also customs procedures."
"The third proposal establishing an action programme for duties in the Community 'Customs-2013' intensifies cooperation between customs administrations and their officials."
"Trans-European information networks are provided for, to facilitate the completion of customs formalities in the internal market and allowing products to be taxed according to national and Community tax legislation within the market."
"This programme plays a key role in the harmonious operation of the internal market and the management of the Union's external borders."
"It also contributes to attaining the Commission's objectives for the years 2005-2009 and the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"(FR) Mr President, a codification is a moment of intelligence: one moves away from law to which one is subjected to law that has been thought out."
"I am therefore very pleased about the reports on customs codification by our fellow Members and friends, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Audy, particularly because, since 1919 in the case of Germany, 1934-35 for France, 1938 for Mexico, and so on, we had lost our codifying ambition."
"Here, of course - let us not be naïve - we are codifying the customs rules simply because of pressure from the United States after 11 September, who want customs that are no longer to do with budgets but with security: hence the addition of control by authorised economic operator, by customs representatives, and so on."
"Beyond this little codification, however, we shall have to think of a customs codification that is legally equal to the challenges of globalisation."
"Since maritime law was codified at Montego Bay in the 1970s, and since International Trade Law was codified at Marrakesh in the 1990s, the 21st century will have to devise a customs codification at the only level appropriate to international trade, that is, at global level."
"The place for working towards this model of a global code exists: it is the World Customs Organisation in Brussels, in partnership with the World Trade Organisation in Geneva."
"The sources of inspiration for this model code exist too: it is the Tokyo Convention and the Brussels Convention on customs value and rules of origin."
"There remains the purpose of this model for a customs code, that is, a revolution in customs technology, so that we can move out of the current archaic system and have customs duties that can be adjusted, reimbursed, subsidised and negotiated."
"Adjusted according to the production cost differential between one country and another; reimbursed, in the form of a customs credit offered by the importing country to the exporting country; subsidised, in favour of exporting countries of the South, who would receive a customs credit supplement; negotiated, finally, in the stock exchange like the protectionist pollution quotas."
"In this way we shall at last achieve a reconciliation between international free trade, which is necessary and national social protection, which is equally necessary."
"This is the marriage of David Ricardo, the free trader, and Friedrich List, the protectionist."
"(SK) To begin with, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Heaton-Harris, for their work in drafting these technically demanding reports."
"From the very beginning, the Customs Union has been considered a cornerstone of the European Community."
"The Customs Code is a practical instrument that ensures smooth trans-border trade, and it should therefore take into consideration the new challenges of a globalising economy."
"The creation and subsequent implementation of a modernised Customs Code is a logical and essential prerequisite for the effective development of the European market."
"The proposal reflects efforts to create a customs and trade environment based on improved effectiveness of customs clearance procedures through information exchange, elimination of the administrative burden, and facilitation of trade at European and international levels."
"In this age of technology, an electronic system offers new opportunities for the quicker and more effective implementation of commonly recognised standards."
"The proposal offers a unique opportunity to overcome existing discrepancies between the customs systems of Member States, as it will ensure enhanced interoperability of national systems, which we have so far failed to encourage adequately."
"At present, security-related issues are becoming a priority, and the proposal therefore also focuses on this area."
"It includes specific measures to secure external borders, as well as data protection."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that these proposals will be accepted during the vote."
"If they are not, we would paradoxically be blocking the free trade that we are actually striving to facilitate."
"(PT) Mr President, to whom I extend my warmest greetings, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally welcome this initiative and commend the rapporteurs on the quality of their work."
"This initiative is of the highest importance, given that the code currently in force dates back to 1992."
"It must be modernised to reflect the changes that have since taken place and must address those changes."
"There are two aspects that strike me as crucial."
"Firstly, this new code will help boost international trade because simplifying the processes may lead to an increase in the competitiveness of European businesses, and thus to stronger economic growth."
"To this end, opening up to new technologies - as well as placing greater value on those technologies and even enforcing their use - represents a highly significant step that should help strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy."
"That being said, there is a second point that must be highlighted, which relates to the nature of the current functions of customs."
"Security needs to be increased at various levels to protect public health, to ensure food safety and to combat crimes such as money laundering, counterfeiting and fraud more effectively."
"In other words, consumers must be better protected."
"I should like to conclude by saying that this proposal is a positive step towards safeguarding more effectively the interests of Europeans both as manufacturers and as consumers."
"As such, we naturally endorse the proposal."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this issue."
"I wish, however, to talk about one specific issue regarding customs policies."
"The single biggest problem currently facing the EU in relation to its customs policies is the unwillingness of the Turkish Government to implement the Ankara Protocol."
"Turkey promised the European Union 18 months ago that it would do so and that, accordingly, Turkish ports and airports would be open to Cypriot ships and air traffic."
"Turkey has failed to honour this political commitment, which is a central element of the Turkish accession negotiations to join the European Union."
"Last week, Turkey offered to open one port to Cypriot traffic."
"This offer was not even given in writing to the Finnish Presidency, and, even so, it falls well short of the commitment given by the Turkish Government that it would implement the Protocol."
"It is now very likely that up to eight chapters of Turkey's accession negotiations with the European Union will be suspended some time this week, which is the recommendation of the European Commission."
"On a broader level, Turkey faces the real possibility that EU accession talks may be fully suspended in time if it does not implement the Ankara Protocol and open up Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot traffic."
"(EL) Mr President, I consider the speech of the previous speaker quite useful and definitely well timed and I would like to endorse everything he said."
"However, I will not just stop at what he said;"
"I would like to refer to the main subject of today's discussion by saying that technology, the Lisbon Strategy and the logic behind the common market force us to modernise the Customs Code."
"The delicate position of the customs representatives and their particular professional nature necessitates the specification of certain criteria for the proper performance of their activities, without these criteria having a negative effect on the internal market or the free transportation of services."
"This is the equation we have to solve."
"Therefore, we have amended Article 11 of the new Customs Code, so that there is no numerical limitation in this particular profession, the recognition of customs representatives throughout the European Union Member States is established and, of course, there is free competition in the sector, in general."
"On the other hand, several of my colleagues, including me, have insisted that the criterion of practical standards or professional qualifications for individuals who wish to become customs representatives must be precisely specified."
"This is because the usefulness of the profession will be acknowledged as well as the considerable services they offer to companies as well as to the customs authorities, and primarily it will ensure the safety and protection of the public's interests."
"Therefore, I believe that with the proposal submitted today by the European Parliament we achieve a proper balance; in that context I would like to thank Mrs Fourtou for her efforts to arrive at this useful compromise within the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that if we wish to create a common market according to the provisions of the Lisbon Strategy and become a considerable competitive power on a global scale, we have no other choice but to effectively meet these trade challenges and adapt to the rapid technological developments."
"To this purpose, not only do we have to eliminate bureaucratic customs procedures but also amend the laws that govern them, in depth."
"Even though our goal is to simplify commercial transactions between Member States while at the same time safeguarding security and protection of European citizens, such a goal would not be feasible without the presence of customs representatives, namely specialised professionals with certified knowledge."
"Therefore, I consider it necessary to issue accreditation to the right individuals using the most commonly accepted criteria."
"I consider that customs brokers provide the necessary guarantee of knowledge and experience for the execution of customs operations and therefore they must be considered accredited customs representatives."
"Let us not forget that they exist as a profession in the vast majority of Member States and they serve an important role to the benefit of all financial agents and especially for small- to medium-sized enterprises whose activities are of vital importance to European growth."
"To conclude, I should like to stress that modernising the Customs Code cannot in any way be identified as deregulation of the labour market of serious professionals who historically have proven their effectiveness."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union's customs system should serve two main purposes."
"Firstly, it should protect the Community's economic and financial interests and secondly, it should facilitate legal trade exchanges and the acceleration and simplification of customs formalities."
"Unfortunately, despite the existence of the Customs 2007 Programme and the allocation of almost EUR 150 million, these aims have not been fully achieved."
"One only has to consider the negative impact on the Community market of large-scale smuggling of alcohol and tobacco products, and recently also of liquid fuels."
"Not only does the scale of this organised smuggling destabilise the internal market, but the Union's budget also suffers as it is deprived of the hundreds of millions of euro it should obtain from customs duties."
"This state of affairs also has an impact on the trade in foodstuffs."
"Products often appear for sale on this market at prices significantly lower than the cost of production, which indicates that the customs system has been evaded."
"This happened recently on the poultry market in Poland, and over the last two years there have also been problems with frozen strawberries from China."
"The second purpose of the customs system, namely facilitating trade exchanges, is not being fulfilled."
"This is particularly obvious along the European Union's eastern border with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine."
"Tiresome procedures, corruption and queues of vehicles stretching back for miles all contribute to making it unattractive to export goods from the European Union."
"I very much hope that the EUR 323 million allocated for the implementation of the Customs 2013 programme will allow significant improvements to be made."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their valuable contributions to the debate and for the positive attitude towards the Commission's proposals."
"The Commission has given appropriate consideration to Parliament's 58 amendments to the Modernised Customs Code and has found the majority - as many as 32 - acceptable, 9 acceptable in principle or in part and only 17 unacceptable."
"I would point out that those amendments which the Commission finds unacceptable are related to the key issues that I highlighted earlier and that are commonly debated by both Parliament and the Council."
"I must reiterate that as regards customs representation - Amendments 14, 19 and 57 - the Commission maintains that the accreditation of professional customs agents falls outside the scope of the Customs Code."
"The Commission fully recognises the role played by customs agents in the world of trade."
"These agents, like any other economic operator, should have the right to exercise their profession in another Member State, and professional competence in one Member State should be recognised in another."
"This is a basic feature of the single market and essential in an electronic environment."
"The Commission is actively working with the professional associations, like CLECAT and CONFIAD, listening to their concerns and trying to find a satisfactory solution."
"The proposed change offers substantial benefits to business in general, such as increased competition between customs service providers, and opens new and wider business opportunities for customs representatives beyond national borders."
"On comitology, I believe that our legal services have come to conclusions that are not too dissimilar."
"There are indeed a few articles where the Commission considers that the regulatory procedure, its scrutiny, should not apply, but in most cases our institutions' respective analyses are converging."
"I should like to clarify why the Commission cannot support certain amendments."
"The first I should mention is Amendment 21, which suggests that in Article 22(1), the words 'administrative and criminal' be deleted."
"All Member States impose criminal penalties in customs matters and apply, even if they are not always described as administrative penalties, measures of an administrative nature intended to penalise non-compliance with the customs rules. There is, for example, the withdrawal or suspension of authorisations in case of serious misuse."
"Such administrative measures play an essential role in the uniform and proportionate application of customs legislation."
"It is therefore necessary that Article 22(1), continues to refer explicitly to both administrative and criminal treatment of infringements."
"The Commission cannot agree with Amendments 23 and 25 relating to customs fees."
"The Commission's intentions are simply to limit, as far as possible, the charging of customs fees; in particular, such fees should not be charged for the drawing-up of electronic declarations."
"On the other hand, we find it inappropriate to prevent the collection of fees where attendance of customs staff is requested beyond the normal office hours."
"We hold the view that customs fees are only legitimate where customs render a service that goes beyond their normal mission."
"I should also mention Amendments 30, 40 and 41, which aim at granting benefits to railway companies."
"The Commission cannot accept them, because they are going against our efforts to build up a level playing field for all transport operators, be they road, inland waterways or air transporters."
"In fact, the original proposals are likely to have been misunderstood and I am confident that once further explained their rationale and fairness will become obvious."
"In conclusion, I can assure you that these issues can and will be urgently and seriously addressed."
"The Commission is confident that, given the spirit of openness and cooperation that has marked the consultations to date both in Parliament and in the Council, practical and appropriate solutions will be found so that the Modernised Customs Code can enter into force as planned in 2009."
"With regard to the customs 2013 programme proposal, I confirm that the Commission fully supports all the amendments proposed by Parliament."
"I hope that the report by Mrs Fourtou will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority."
"Let me finish by repeating that the strong support by the European Parliament for the e-customs proposal will certainly be acknowledged by the Council and speed up the adoption of the proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Prevention of injury and promotion of safety (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Sinnott, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety C6-0238/2006."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work done by the members of the committees concerned with the Commission's proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety."
"Let me acknowledge in particular the effort made by Mrs Sinnott in respect of this important initiative."
"I should also like to express my thanks to the Austrian Presidency for hosting a conference during its term, which also contributed to this issue."
"The Commission started to support actions in the area of injury prevention under the former EU programme on injury prevention and has continued its support under the current public health programme."
"Injuries represent, as you know, after cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory diseases, the fourth most common cause of death in the Member States. Every year, some 235 000 EU citizens die as a result of an accident or violence."
"Over 50 million citizens seek medical treatment for injuries and 6.8 million of those are admitted to hospital."
"Injuries, unintentional and intentional, are estimated to be the main cause of chronic disability in young people, leading to an enormous loss of life-years in good health. Among people over 65, accidents and injuries are also a major cause of death and disability and are often the trigger for a fatal deterioration in health."
"Areas that have attracted less attention in the past include home, leisure and sports accidents, as well as accidents in vulnerable population groups, such as children, adolescents and elderly people."
"Research shows that more than 50 % of serious accidents are preventable and that reduction by one quarter should be a realistic target over the next 10 years."
"But, of course, it is of the utmost importance to have reliable information on injuries in Europe in order to plan actions."
"Injury information is also essential for evaluating the outcome of all our efforts and actions."
"The Commission has set out a Community action plan on injury prevention and safety promotion in its communication 'Action for a Safer Europe'."
"Member States are encouraged to create similar national plans for injury prevention."
"Such plans should serve as a framework for actions that engage relevant partners and stakeholders."
"They should define institutional responsibilities and should be based on good practice and safety promotion."
"The Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety is a first step towards combining the efforts of the Commission with those of the Member States for actions for a safer Europe, in order to reduce the individual and societal burden of injuries."
"Through such a joint approach, through learning from each other's experiences, we can have faster and more effective results."
"We hope and expect that the situation within the Member States in relation to accidents and injuries will improve significantly in years to come."
"Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee. I am looking forward to a very interesting debate."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, injuries can take or change a life in a split second."
"They can be accidental, inflicted or self-inflicted."
"Injuries cause the death of a quarter of a million people and result in 65 hospital admissions every year."
"The challenge, when dealing with something as widespread, serious and preventable as injury, is to save lives and preserve health."
"For that reason I felt both challenged and privileged to work on this report."
"In this report, which particularly focuses on injury data collection, I have recommended that to promote safety and prevent injury we need better-quality data."
"It is not helpful in terms of prevention to know the overall number of road fatalities."
"We need to know what it was that made the fatal difference."
"Was it the condition or type of vehicle; was the victim the driver, a passenger or someone walking along the road; were drink, speed or bad weather conditions involved; what was the road like?"
"That is the type of breakdown we need in every area of injury if we are going to save lives."
"We cannot hope to closely examine every injury but we should and must create a system of data collection that more closely examines the injury determinants of all fatal and seriously disabling injuries, to prevent them more effectively in the future."
"That is my approach in the report, which the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety strongly supported."
"Gathering such information may seem difficult, but in reality a great deal of information is already in place: insurance companies have detailed data on accidents; police have data on violent and self-inflicted harm."
"We must identify the experts in injury reporting and work with them to get the information that can be studied to truly prevent injuries and promote safety."
"The Commission document allowed the injury and safety surveillance system a place within all future health programmes."
"That would surely allow the system funding, regardless of whether it proved effective or beneficial."
"We feel strongly that a real initiative to prevent injury and promote safety is so important that it needs to be put on its own stream within the health programmes."
"We need to think about that again in more detail when we consider the health programmes themselves."
"That means that this particular recommendation should not yet be linked to the health programmes but should be considered alongside them."
"That is why the Committee on the Environment took out all mention of health programmes from the document."
"The Commission laid out seven priorities to which we have added injury and safety in the workplace, and we have also stressed domestic violence among women and children."
"One change I ask that we make is to take out Amendment 4, which we will vote on separately tomorrow."
"That suggests: 'Domestic violence against women is the main cause of death and invalidity among women between the ages of 16 and 44.'"
"Domestic violence against women and children is clearly a crime and I strongly support amendments that have highlighted that."
"However, a recommendation to produce higher-quality data cannot itself include inaccurate data."
"The statistic this amendment presents on the main cause of death is inaccurate."
"As recently as October a Eurostat publication said that transport accidents and suicide were the main causes of death of women in that age group."
"Because we want to make injury surveillance more comprehensive we include mention of risk-taking behaviour, drugs and alcohol, gender considerations, social and environmental condition."
"Self-harm is also emphasised because of its increasing incidence."
"We have also made additions to the list of high-risk groups to include the young, the elderly, disabled people and women."
"The list is not exhaustive."
"I support the amendments on needle-stick injuries and injuries to healthcare workers."
"We know the solution to them."
"They are easily preventable and therefore completely inexcusable."
"It is clear that injury places a heavy burden on the economy."
"For me, however, it is a question of injured people and their families."
"In my opinion, the real key to preventing injury and promoting safety is the value we place on the human person."
"If you have a Renaissance masterpiece you handle it with far more care than a magazine poster."
"We need to return again to people and their value as the central issue."
"Some injuries will happen - we cannot prevent them all - but with better understanding of how they happen, resulting in safer products and practices, we can reduce their occurrence."
"However, we will not have a serious effect on the level of injury until people realise that every person matters and that the loss or disablement of even one person is a great loss to us all."
"When we understand that, we will treat each other and ourselves like the masterpiece that we are and we will realise our shared responsibility for each other's safety."
"That is what is behind Amendment 21 and why I emphasise to the Commission that the tragedy of injury is so much more than the economic burden."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, eight years ago I had the honour of being the rapporteur of a programme for the prevention of injuries during recreational hours; at that time I had been impressed by the large number of such injuries, which indicated that we have a serious problem."
"I would like to state that the report submitted by Mrs Sinnott is very good;"
"I also helped in that direction with my own amendments, so that if in the future a community mechanism is created, that is 'injury registration operation' it assists in the development of national prevention policies, because the systematic collection of data will reveal the causes of these injuries, namely what we call determinants of injury."
"I consider that the primary causes mentioned by the rapporteur, must be linked, to the effectiveness of injury prevention exclusively; in particular I suggest that we look into the issue of the elderly, who make up for the majority of the victims and the injuries that originate from violence against women, which I believe is quite a large number, and of course road accidents, car accidents and also sports accidents as well as accidents that are caused by products and services."
"In order to increase efficiency and reduce cost, I consider it necessary to integrate the existing programmes and infrastructures (data banks and so on), because the Commission already has programmes covering this subject; therefore there is data that must be taken into consideration when it prepares its proposal to Parliament."
"This mechanism will gather details provided from Member States based on their national injury supervision systems, allowing easy access to information and correct practices."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude by saying that the thousands of deaths along with the financial damage created by injuries is an open wound for the European communities."
"It will not heal easily, but we can still create in the future a community mechanism for gathering data that will assist us in the effective prevention of such injuries."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figures are indicative of the need to warn the citizens of the consequences of risky behaviour."
"How many accidents of different kinds are caused by alcoholism or drug use?"
"How many serious injuries among children are the result of a lack of care by adults, for example, children swallowing detergents or medicines?"
"Currently, some 235 000 European citizens die as a result of an accident or violence-related injuries. This amounts to 600 fatalities per day in the EU alone."
"These are shocking figures, which lead, on the one hand, to personal suffering and tragedy, and, on the other, to social and budgetary costs."
"It is a fact. Accident and injury comes at a very heavy human price - premature death, years living with incapacity - and entails high costs in terms of healthcare and loss to society owing to lack of productivity."
"Injuries can be avoided, however. It is therefore essential to adopt healthier lifestyles and to make living conditions safer."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"The risk of injury is not spread equally across all Member States or all social groups."
"Risk factors are also determined by the home and work environment."
"Age and gender should also be taken into account."
"This is why I tabled an amendment aimed at gender mainstreaming across all areas including health policy."
"To this end, quantitative gender-based studies must be carried out and resources applying the principle of gender budgeting must be allocated because, as previous speakers have said, domestic violence, violence against women, is also a significant cause of injuries that are terrible, first and foremost, for women, but also for society."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to congratulate Mrs Sinnott on her excellent report, which deserves our full support."
"The subject matter of this draft legislative resolution is undoubtedly extremely important, as it concerns the premature deaths of more than 200 000 EU citizens annually and the injury of several million individuals in the 25 Member States."
"Some of these injuries are horrific, and many result in the permanent disfigurement or severe lifelong disability of thousands of people."
"Two main aspects of the prevention of accidental injury are: the identification and assessment of risks factors, and the proper communication and implementation of safety measures."
"Mrs Sinnott correctly notes that, in addition to the gathering of information on injuries by way of establishing a surveillance system, the Council's report needs to be enriched by placing more emphasis on the promotion of safety and raising risk-awareness among the general public."
"Of the numerous serious risk factors affecting human life, allow me to concentrate on just one: alcohol and road safety."
"In this area, there is much to be done in terms of prevention."
"The use of alcohol by drivers is extremely dangerous, mainly because alcohol suppresses our higher-level brain function, resulting in impairment of sense perception, slowness of reflexes, disturbance of locomotor muscle coordination and poor understanding of danger."
"In this respect, alcohol has, through the years, been responsible for the deaths of millions of road users worldwide."
"Yet, either because of ignorance, or more likely as a result of very strong lobbying by the alcohol industry, we fail to comprehend fully that much more drastic action on drink-driving is necessary."
"Instead, we are led to believe that alcohol intake is safe below certain limits, i.e. 50 mg per 100 ml of blood in most EU countries."
"This is totally wrong in my view."
"There is no safe limit for alcohol and driving."
"Any alcohol intake, however small, will affect brain activity to some extent."
"Whereas a driver with a blood alcohol level of 20, 30 or 40 mg/100 ml might be legally entitled to drive, he or she is at a much higher risk of being involved in an accident than someone without any alcohol in their blood at all."
"Our state education systems, as well as our legal systems, give our drivers a false sense of security in allowing them to think that, as long as they do not drink excessively, they are safe on the roads."
"This is criminally wrong and we must correct this situation by helping to bring about a zero-alcohol-level approach for drivers."
"Only then can we hope to reduce significantly the number of alcohol-related road deaths."
"But - and unfortunately there is always a 'but' in politics - how many of us are willing and able to take on the task of fighting for no-alcohol intake legislation for drivers, and how many of us will survive politically if we come into direct conflict with the alcohol-related industries by supporting a zero-alcohol level for drivers?"
"In conclusion, if there is an important injury-prevention message for our people this Christmas, it is that alcohol is a killer on the roads, in large as well as small quantities, and that the only safe driving alcohol level is a zero level."
"(SK) I would like to join those who support the Council's recommendations."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for drafting the European Parliament's report on this issue."
"The basic reason for drafting this report has been mentioned several times tonight."
"Every day, 600 people die as a result of accidents and injuries, which equates to a quarter of a million people per year."
"On the one hand, these numbers express the grief and bereavement of families, and on the other hand, we must not forget that accidents and violence in the area of social and economic life also constitute a major economic burden on the state."
"In many Member States, hospitals are required to consider meticulously the effectiveness of treatment, for instance in cancer patients."
"While the treatment of victims of accidents and violence requires substantial spending, these conditions are preventable."
"Each year seven million people in the European Union are admitted to hospitals and as many as 65 million require medical care."
"These statistics express and reflect the enormous suffering sustained by all those affected."
"Therefore, I believe that the proposal for common procedures by EU Member States to decrease levels of accidents and violence is highly effective."
"Accurate statistics reflecting differences between Member States will help us to identify prevention methods more precisely."
"If it is known that persons aged over 65 account for 16% of the EU population and 40% of fatal accidents, we should launch a series of awareness campaigns or introduce protective schemes that target people in this particular age group."
"Young people are another important group that we should be focusing on for the prevention of accidents and violence."
"Sports injuries occur quite often under the supervision of coaches and during free-time activities."
"We must respect our health and the health of others."
"Together, we should oppose the daily violence to which we are exposed to on TV and in films and children's games, which often constitute an encouragement to these undesirable forms of behaviour in society."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's endeavours to reduce the large number of accidents and casualties and significantly improve the situation in Member States are certainly welcome, and indeed the rapporteur has had a few things to say about that."
"Do we really think, however, that these measures will result in fewer accidents in these countries?"
"I believe that the exact opposite will be the case."
"These measures will mean the commitment of funds in these countries that can be used for precisely these measures."
"I should like to comment on the costs, which are always set out."
"Naturally, I am concerned about the number of casualties."
"I read today, with regard to REACH, the amount by which we could reduce healthcare expenditure if we managed to improve this situation."
"The figures are correct, of course, but we shall never achieve them."
"The only thing we shall achieve with this document is red tape, even though we all insist that the EU rejects this and wants to reduce it."
"Yet the EU Member States are well-placed to deal with this problem."
"They collect their own statistics, they take the necessary measures, they know the local situation much better than we in Brussels or Strasbourg do."
"We are deceiving ourselves if we suppose that our statistics are able to tell the Member States anything they do not already know; we are on the wrong track."
"Taking driving as an example, we cannot hope to influence driving practices in Sicily or Finland from Brussels."
"This can only be done by taking action locally, and therefore such action should be regulated purely by means of subsidiarity."
"I should like to offer a rather exaggerated analogy."
"Say someone were to tell me today that many people are injured falling off ladders whilst hanging curtains. There are some countries that traditionally do not use curtains and thus do not experience such accidents."
"Who would try to make a comparison?"
"That is the way of things in many other cases, too."
"In my opinion, therefore, we are on the wrong track here."
"We should re-think these measures and focus on bilateral measures that will really lead to a reduction in accidents, as this proposal will not achieve that."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Members for a very interesting debate."
"I share with most of you the frustration we are facing that in the European Union we still have so many preventable causes of injury, death and ill-health, and that there is so much more we could do about it."
"I think these contributions are a step in the right direction and contribute to this effort."
"I know that the European Parliament has been consistently proactive on the subject of injury prevention, and today's debate shows the interest in this issue."
"For us, and me personally, the main target, the centre of my policies is the human being - people - and this is reality."
"But, in this day and age we also have to admit that unfortunately not all decision-makers have that as their sole consideration."
"So when we are able to accompany those arguments with financial and economic arguments, we can achieve this purpose even better."
"Without saying that these would be the priority or the main consideration, it does help."
"In addition to the human suffering, in addition to the pain, in addition to the social impact that injuries have, they also cause a serious problem for the economies of Member States and therefore investment from that point of view is also required."
"Regarding the Commission's position on the different amendments, the Commission can fully accept a large number of amendments, for example, 5, 18, 21, and partially accept amendments 7, 11, 15, 16 and 17."
"The full list of the Commission's positions on each amendment is being made available to Parliament and I trust that it will be included in the record of this sitting."
"We cannot accept the amendment that concerns the deletion of the financial mechanisms under the public health programme because we do not have any alternative, and on legal grounds we cannot accept an amendment that obtains support through the cohesion and structural funds."
"So, in the circumstances we will have to insist on maintaining the funding through the public health programme."
"The main target of this proposal is of course the issue of information, because without the right information we will not be able to set the policies, we will not be able to set the targets, we will not know whether we are achieving our targets."
"Most Member States need help, and this can be shown from the results, from the information we have, and based both on the Treaty and the policies of complementing and supporting Member States in their efforts and also in coordinating the policy of Member States irrespective of policies, which is the reason for this proposal."
"It is true that there is information here and there, but we need to pull it all together so that we can learn from each other's experiences and prove that this is a European Union of solidarity, a European Union of cooperation, where we can learn from each other's experiences and help each other so that every single Member State does not have to go through this learning process at the cost of lives, at a cost to the health of European citizens."
"That is the challenge before us, and I think we can make great use of this possibility of an exchange of best practices and information and close cooperation."
"That is the target of this proposal, and I would like once again to thank Mrs Sinnott and Parliament for their support for our proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Annex - Position of the Commission"
"Sinnott report"
"The Commission can accept Amendments 5, 18 and 21."
"Amendments 7, 11, 15, 16 and 17 can be accepted in part."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30."
"Expenditure in the veterinary field (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field C6-0199/2006."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to say that I am grateful for the work done by the Members of the committees concerned with this Commission proposal to amend Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field."
"This year, the Commission allocated approximately EUR 210 million to assist Member States in running eradication and monitoring programmes to counter animal diseases."
"This programme is a key element in our food safety strategy."
"As we all know, animal diseases are unpredictable - the unexpected can and does happen."
"In 2005-2006 even though we saw outbreaks of avian flu, blue tongue and classical swine fever in some Member States, none of them was a major outbreak and we managed to keep them under control and not allow them to cause extensive damage."
"The Commission has embarked on a wide-ranging review of Community animal health policy."
"An extensive evaluation has recently been completed and the results were presented at a conference held in Brussels last month."
"I was pleased to note that several honourable Members attended, and indeed chaired, sessions."
"One of the primary areas of interest for discussion today and one which generated considerable interest was the possible introduction of an insurance or cost-sharing element to help fund disease eradication costs."
"However, these are longer-term measures which still need considerable discussion with the various stakeholders before we can determine how best to proceed."
"There are, however, a number of key changes which we can make now, in order to improve efficiency in how the Commission and the Member States manage funding in this area."
"The proposal before us today aims to make such changes, while allowing the necessary time for other longer-term issues to be dealt with in the ongoing policy review."
"The proposal contains three main elements."
"First, we propose to introduce the possibility of multiannual programming for the disease eradication programmes, but with a simplified procedure which will make it easier both for the Member States and also for the Commission."
"Second, we propose to strengthen the legal basis for the TRACES programme, but also for communication."
"It is interesting to note that we currently have a legal base for communication activities in animal welfare but not for animal health, and this is going to be corrected in the proposal."
"Third, we propose to limit the list of disease eradication programmes eligible for funding to those that correspond to clear priorities, but with a procedure under which this list could be amended when necessary in response to developments."
"The proposed changes would make important advances in strengthening and prioritising our food safety strategy."
"The proposal makes a number of improvements which will also increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy, both for the Commission and the Member States."
"I am grateful for Parliament's support."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I submit to the Chamber on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the proposal by the Commission regarding the possibility of approving multi-annual programmes and updating some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health."
"It also considers, however, that some specific measures contained in the proposals aimed at amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC fall short of what is required."
"We therefore wish to highlight 12 amendments aimed at achieving five key objectives, which are as follows: in view of the lack of knowledge of what has occurred with programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases in the various Member States, the first of the objectives is to call on the Commission to submit a report every four years to Parliament and the Council on the animal health situation and on the cost-effectiveness of implementing the programmes in the Member States, including an explanation of the criteria adopted."
"The second is to support the dissemination of good practices and to encourage the submission of joint programmes by two or more Member States in border regions wherever this is shown to be important for the prevention, control, monitoring and eradication of contagious animal diseases, including zoonoses, in view of the different attitudes and behaviour in different Member States, even neighbouring ones, as regards the same diseases, which can affect the measures adopted."
"The third is to make it compulsory for funding proposals to be submitted in the event of emergency situations, which require the sudden and unforeseeable disbursement of very large financial resources. The funding proposals should not be subject to the deadlines referred to in this decision, which should, in any event, extend the deadlines laid down by the Commission."
"An example of this is the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2000."
"For diseases of this kind, the sooner measures are imposed and the more radical they are, the more effective they will be."
"For this to be possible, a minimum financial reserve needs to be set up to respond to disasters which arise suddenly, insidiously and unforeseeably."
"Fourthly, we are proposing to extend the list, attached to this decision, of contagious animal diseases to which Community financial support can be granted. The Commission had proposed to cut this list."
"The proposal contained in this report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development thus adds eight diseases to the current list, and proposes more aimed at also ensuring funding for their control and eradication."
"I wish to highlight the vital importance of this proposal, given that in a number of countries there are eradication programmes already under way, which should not be interrupted."
"In Portugal, where I am most familiar with the situation, bovine leucosis is a disease for which eradication programmes have been running for around 20 years, and it is now in the final stage of definitive eradication."
"Very few cases of leucosis were detected last year and it is estimated that the disease can be definitively eradicated in one year's time."
"Making the disease ineligible for funding could compromise all the efforts made and lead to its uncontrolled resurgence."
"Another example is Newcastle disease, which is endemic in wild birds and could be transmitted to unvaccinated poultry at any time."
"The economic consequences of this disease could be devastating for birds."
"Aujeszky's disease in pigs, which the Commission proposed to exclude, is also the subject of a planned programme for Portugal, where failure to eradicate the disease means that it is impossible to export pigs to some markets."
"Swine brucellosis is another disease not included in the current list, which may pose the same type of problems for trade, and is endemic in Portugal and the Mediterranean basin."
"In order to simplify the legislation in force, the Commission is also proposing the repeal of Council Decision 90/638/EEC laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases, replacing those criteria with fresh technical criteria set out in the annexes to the new decision currently under review, which the Commission intends subsequently to transform into criteria and standard requirements."
"In this report we are proposing that Parliament issue a new opinion in the event of a change in the criteria in force."
"Lastly, Mr President, I wish to pass on my thanks to all those who helped draw up this report. The Commission will hopefully take on board the proposals put forward in the report, which are aimed at helping improve animal health."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report and the Commission for its contribution this evening."
"I will deal with the future, because that is important in terms of the review."
"However, as regards the issues in this report, as we have said, by and large we agree with much of the proposal."
"Everyone recognises the need to control and monitor animal diseases, not only because of the human health implications, but also because of the economic consequences where there are outbreaks."
"Take Ireland in 2001, where we had a foot-and-mouth outbreak and the country came to a standstill."
"Thankfully, we got it under control, but it showed what can happen when there are problems."
"Information is the key to controlling, monitoring and being effective when diseases occur, and I am glad to see that we will be looking at better information systems within Member States and between Member States."
"The funding proposal for information policy is very positive, and the multiannual programme is a very practical proposal: it makes it easier for Member States and that is to be welcomed, as are the joint programmes by two Member States or border regions."
"We need the extension of the time limit for proposals from Member States in relation to their disease programmes."
"We extended the list of diseases; we are conscious that Article 6 allows for emergency situations, and that is to be welcomed."
"I have a particular point to make as we look to the future: Europe needs to look beyond its borders and to ensure that our trade policy does not conflict with public health and food safety issues."
"We allow food imports into the EU and, at the very least, we need to ensure that the standards of our imports meet those of our home-produced food."
"We need to exclude imports where we have any doubt whatsoever."
"It is all too easy to import a problem, but it is very difficult to tackle a problem once it is within our borders."
"I am concerned that the WTO may be pushing for trade without due concern to animal health and human health implications."
"I am not convinced that our current rules meet my concerns and I do not believe that computerised systems alone will protect us."
"Let me finish by saying that we have taken the lead in the EU on these issues, but it would be regrettable if, in pursuit of a trade deal, we were to sacrifice our standards and the health of our animals and of our citizens."
"Mr President, the present Commission proposal does not make any change to the existing rules on the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses, but rather aims to update some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health."
"We welcome this, but we welcome in particular the Commission's announcement that it will shortly be submitting a full report on European animal health policy."
"That would be a good time and opportunity to discuss further-reaching changes to the present rules and, if necessary, to set up a new legal framework."
"We agree with the objectives of the proposal as set out in the Commission's explanatory statement, and also with the rapporteur."
"We support the proposed amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC, and we also support the critical comments and notes by the rapporteur on the financing of the system for monitoring the movement of animals, and also on the system for financing unforeseeable diseases and outbreaks of epidemics, or animal diseases causing lasting harm."
"Measures for combating animal diseases always require large amounts of funding, and providing this at short notice is often the problem."
"The rapporteur's suggestion that certain funds be set aside in a reserve should of course be considered."
"Our secret hope is that the proposed amendments improve the implementation of the cofinanced programmes on the eradication of animal diseases."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur for her very well-balanced report."
"As previous speakers, particularly Dr Kindermann, have already said, this is a technical report that introduces urgently needed amendments."
"Flexibility is essential in crisis situations."
"Assistance provided swiftly is worth double in such circumstances."
"The reaction and measures taken must be prudent, however, and preventive action is better than reaction."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been calling for monitoring of imports of live animals from non-EU countries to be as intensive as EU monitoring for many years."
"As we all know, animal health has a direct impact on products of animal origin and thus, ultimately, on public health."
"For this reason, special attention should be paid to ensuring that negative effects of the kind seen in the past no longer arise, where public confidence in products of animal origin is seriously dented, with damaging consequences for the economy."
"(PL) Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament and also as a veterinary surgeon, I would like to express my support for Mrs Figueiredo's report, in particular its call for infectious animal diseases such as bovine leucosis and Aujeszky's disease to be kept on the list of diseases eligible for cofinancing from Community funds."
"I would like to remind the House that eradicating these diseases in certain Member States is particularly important, amongst other reasons because of trade within the Union."
"One of the conditions for placing pigs on the market is that they should originate from a region or country free from Aujeszky's disease."
"A similar situation exists for cattle, which must originate from herds certified free from enzootic bovine leucosis."
"Many new Member States have limited budgets and consequently do not have the financial resources necessary to completely eradicate these diseases."
"The European Commission's proposed adjustment of the list of diseases involving the removal of bovine leucosis and Aujeszky's disease, may lead to significant cuts in the preventive programmes in place, or even to them being completely halted."
"It is essential that any future updating of the list of diseases should only take place after the consent of the European Parliament and the Council has been obtained."
"Mr President, I welcome the interest shown by the Members in the proposal to modify what we call the veterinary fund."
"I appreciate that the overall principles of the proposal have been accepted by Parliament."
"The suggestions made are good ones but many of those are already being applied."
"The idea, for example, to allow emergency expenditure in a crisis is indeed essential, but the provision already exists in the decision under Article 3."
"The Commission funds actions to deal with those diseases on an emergency basis, normally at 50% co-financing of eligible measures and 60% for foot-and-mouth disease."
"The idea of ensuring coordination between Member States submitting programmes is also welcome but this is also the case in reality."
"We will continue that approach but we feel that Article 16 is not the proper location."
"We will introduce the idea somewhere else - the idea of task forces and sharing best practice."
"The eradication plans are publicly available on the Commission's website, but we would be very happy to provide information on progress to Parliament and the Council and we recommend these to the Member States."
"The decision sets out the criteria that Member States must fulfil when submitting eradication programmes to the Commission for consideration."
"Those are technical criteria."
"Therefore the regulatory committee procedure is appropriate to define the information required."
"Member States need to be very precise in the information they supply and it is therefore helpful for the Commission to specify the format required."
"On the suggestion to delay the final date for submitting an application for funding, we encourage Member States to submit applications as early in the year as possible."
"Nevertheless, we can accept a final date of 30 April."
"With regard to the list of diseases eligible to receive funding, which was raised by many speakers, we have proposed shortening the list to focus efforts on the key priorities: those diseases that have indirect implications for human health and diseases that may lead to serious trade problems."
"The addition of diseases or wider possibilities to allow Member States to submit any programme at all would risk dilution of those priorities."
"Nevertheless many of the diseases and issues raised will be or are being covered differently, for example, through the emergency expenditure (Article 3 of the decision)."
"It covers those diseases that have the potential to cause very serious losses, such as classical swine fever, avian influenza or FMD, for example."
"There are, however, two diseases on the list today, for which Member States currently receive funding: Aujeszky's disease and bovine leucosis."
"For those two cases I am prepared to examine ways in which funding can continue for a number of years."
"A full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments will be provided to Parliament. I trust that they will be included in the record of the sitting."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Annex - Position of the Commission"
"Figueiredo report"
"The Commission can accept Amendments 7, 8 and 10."
"Amendments 1, 2, 4 and 12 can be accepted in part."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11."
"Banana sector (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation amending regulations (EEC) No 404/93, (EC) No 1782/2003 and (EC) No 247/2006 as regards the banana sector C6-0339/2006."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Members for their efforts to speed up the discussion on this banana proposal, and express special thanks to Mr Fruteau, who delivered an excellent report within a very tight time frame."
"I am convinced that we all have an interest in approving the banana proposal before the end of the year, to give the producers a clear framework within which to operate in the future and also, of course, to achieve budget stability; but also to reassure the banana producing regions that they can count on the tangible solidarity of the European Union."
"Bananas are very important for the social and economic viability of our outermost regions."
"They provide revenue to more than 15 000 holdings and jobs to some 24 000 farmers."
"Those regions face very specific handicaps and the Treaty itself grants them a specific status, in Article 299."
"They are, in all respects, part of the European Union and have every right to enjoy the benefits of European Union policy."
"The banana reform is the practical expression of our commitment to confirm solidarity within the Union."
"I am very happy that the European Parliament agrees with the Commission on the need to reform the current banana aid scheme and to try to bring it into line with our common agricultural policy."
"A crucial consideration is the budgetary unpredictability of the current expenditures within the banana sector."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament agrees on the very substance of the proposal, namely, the choice of the POSEI solution, which represents quite a number of different advantages."
"First of all, it is consistent with the CAP reform; it is a very flexible tool for Member States and for the regions in question; it permits Member States to give additional financing; and, last but not least, it gives predictability from a financial point of view."
"Another important point on which you agree with the Commission's proposal regards the budget, which is based on the average support granted over the period 2000-2002, and a marginal assurance has been added to take into account the variability of the banana market."
"The recent change in the import arrangements and a possible agreement with banana-producing third countries have also been taken into account."
"You have requested that the Commission should submit a specific report on POSEI in 2009, if the livelihoods of banana producers, in particular, were to deteriorate following a change in the external regime."
"As a matter of fact, our proposal already focuses on, or foresees, the submission of a report on the whole POSEI regime in 2009, and that will include the banana sector."
"Let us not forget that the banana sector represents more than 50% of the agricultural revenue in some producing regions."
"It goes without saying that this report will be submitted sooner in the event of a deterioration of livelihood in the outermost regions."
"As concerns Crete, Cyprus and the Algarve, we should keep in mind that banana production involves less than 400 hectares and some 300 holdings overall."
"That hardly justifies a derogation from the general principle that allows farmers the freedom to choose their crops according to the market and the best advantage they can derive from their production."
"I am looking forward to the discussion with you tonight."
"Again, thank you for being so quick in your action on this issue."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is, today, about to reform the internal strand of the common market organisation (CMO) in the banana sector, in order to adapt the aid scheme for European producers to the new global trade situation and to the principles of the new common agricultural policy."
"This change, which is the subject of the report brought before the House today after being approved by a very large majority by Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, undoubtedly goes in the right direction."
"For banana producers in the outermost regions, who account for more than 98% of the EU's production, it is proposed to transfer a package of almost EUR 280 million a year to the POSEI programmes, which will make for greater flexibility and better use of Community funds."
"In this regard, I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for the reassessment of the amounts allotted for this reform, which should make it possible to better assure the sector's viability, particularly in the outermost regions where banana production plays a vital economic and social role for which no other agricultural product could compensate."
"I must, however, remind you that the amounts proposed were calculated on the basis of the current customs tariff."
"Consequently, the uncertainty concerning world trade negotiations suggests that there may be a further reduction in this tariff level."
"Given that, at EUR 176 a tonne, the banana sector is already in an extremely delicate situation that threatens the socio-economic balance of many of the producing regions, a further reduction in the customs tariff would signal the end of banana production in the Community if no adjustment is made to the plan proposed by the Commission."
"If the opening up of markets is to make a contribution to revitalising the production structures, it can do so only insofar as the fundamental principles of regulation and equity are combined, that is, the various producers need to respect the common rules that put them on an equal commercial footing."
"It is, however, quite evident that this equality is totally lacking in global trade given the gulf that exists between the social and environmental standards of European countries and those of the countries of Central or Latin America."
"Faced with this problem, the resolution of which has to remain one of the European Union's priorities, the aid granted to Community banana producers is necessary in order to compensate for the failures in the global trade system."
"To be effective, these internal regulatory measures must be in line with the external regulatory tools."
"It is in this light that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is insisting on strengthening the evaluation measures indicated in the reform proposals, in order that the Commission could take positive steps if the external tariff situation were to deteriorate, for example by increasing the amount of the financial packages granted to producers."
"The survival of banana production in the European Union also depends on its capacity to optimise its production costs while respecting the social rules and living standards of the producers."
"Since the CMO was established, producers' organisations have in this way enabled a better concentration of Community supply of bananas in the market and contributed to a noticeable reduction in the costs relating to the cultivation of bananas in the European Union."
"It would now be contradictory in economic terms to disrupt this process."
"That is why we believe it is essential to maintain a regulatory framework in this regard at Community level in relation to producers' organisations, in order to further the efforts already made towards strengthening our production structures."
"As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has asked, this willingness should, furthermore, be demonstrated by an obligation to affiliate to a producers' organisation in order to benefit from aid provided within the context of the POSEI package, except when circumstances do not allow it."
"Finally, and this will be my last comment, there is the question of the administration of aid."
"The support system for production within the present CMO in bananas does provide for schemes for bi-monthly advances that are essential to the sector's activity in the outermost regions as in the rest of the Union's producing countries."
"The transfer of packages to the POSEI programmes, however, is not coupled with any plan to continue this system of advances."
"This jeopardises the survival of producers who would therefore have to resort to private sector borrowing, at a time when the characteristic fluctuations of the commercial climate in this sector does not encourage banks to grant long-term loans."
"In this context of economic instability it is up to the European public powers to provide adequate safeguards so that these trade policy choices at global level do not run counter to the interests of those producers who are the most fragile in the Union."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (ES) Mr President, the Committee on Budgets has unanimously approved its opinion for this report on the reform of the Council Regulation and, furthermore, it entirely agrees with the fundamental aspects of that proposed reform."
"Our only complaints - and the Commissioner herself has already explained them - relate to the lack of time available to us to analyse the proposal, since we have had to opt for the urgency procedure."
"In any event, in the view of the Committee on Budgets, the only important thing is to accept the general funding mechanism proposed and, at the same time, to ensure that the proposal is entirely in line with the Court of Auditors' report on the financial management of the common organisation of the markets in the banana sector."
"Our committee simply proposes an amendment of a generic nature, which we are proposing for all programmes not subject to codecision, calling for the general financial framework that we have approved for 2007-2013 to be respected."
"At the same time, in order to stress Parliament's involvement even further and given that the consultation procedure is being chosen, we would like the aid to banana producers to be subject to this Parliament's control by means of the annual budgetary procedure."
"As a whole, however, this proposal is a good one and fundamentally helps all of those outlying European regions that face great difficulties competing with third-country products."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PT) Mr President, the Commission's proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market (COM) in the bananas sector forms part of the process of liberalising the farming sector at EU level and in the context of the World Trade Organisation."
"The Commission is proposing to decouple aid from production, to implement the single payment system, and to abolish the compensatory aid scheme that contributed to price stability and safeguarded, albeit only partially, producers' income."
"The 'POSEI' option involves incorporating existing aid into the POSEI programmes for banana producers in the outermost regions, namely Madeira, the Azores, Martinique, Guadeloupe and the Canary Islands."
"The Commission's proposal is also aimed at saving money by stabilising budget expenditure on the COM."
"Consequently, if the objective is to guarantee an income and a decent standard of living for banana producers, it is hard to see how the Commission's proposals will improve upon the current COM."
"Far from it, in fact."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to emphasise the socio-economic importance of the banana sector in the outermost regions and its contribution to achieving economic and social cohesion, on account of the income and employment which it generates, the economic activities to which it gives rise, both upstream and downstream, and its effect of maintaining an environmental and landscape balance which encourages the development of tourism."
"The amendments tabled by this committee, some of which are referred to in this report, are essentially aimed at offsetting some of the negative points in the Commission's proposal."
"They seek to protect producers, to ensure the development of the sector, to guarantee the implementation of a system of advances, and to continue to support producers' organisations in order to promote marketing."
"Furthermore, we are proposing mandatory interim assessments of the new measures in order to ensure the levels of income and employment and to prevent any deterioration in the sector's economic situation."
"Lastly, we are proposing only the partial decoupling of aid."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate Mr Fruteau on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report and for his willingness to reach a consensus."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her proposed reform, which has been accepted in general terms both by the sector and by this Parliament."
"I hope that, from now on, these new rules will put an end once and for all to the arguments within the World Trade Organisation, and I would therefore ask that, despite the new pressure from certain Latin American countries, the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne, which entered into force on 1 January following the agreement reached in Hong Kong, be defended and maintained as a minimum with a view to providing the European banana sector with a little stability."
"Commissioner, the outermost regions, which are the European Union's main producers of bananas, are highly dependent on this product and therefore any modification to the arrangements governing the sector, in particular to the external arrangements, must be taken into account."
"I am therefore amazed by the debate that is taking place within the Council of Ministers on the period of reference proposed, which has led to a budget of EUR 280 million per year."
"I must insist that that period of reference must be the same as the one applied to the other COM reforms, and it would therefore be incomprehensible for there to be an exception to the rule set so far, or a budgetary haggle, when 98% of that sum is quite rightly intended for the outermost regions."
"Since it is important, I would also like to mention another of the requests included in the report: that relating to the continuity of the system for producers' organisations, with a view to maintaining the concentration of the Community produce, which has been one of the main successes of the COM in bananas."
"Its disappearance, Commissioner, would only exacerbate the disadvantages faced by Community producers in the face of third-country imports."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission has made a great effort to adapt the internal system for bananas to changing circumstances."
"I believe that we must congratulate the Commission on that effort, which will essentially make it possible for Community banana producers to survive in very difficult circumstances."
"As Mr Fruteau, the rapporteur for this report, pointed out, there is still concern about a possible future change to the common organisation of the markets in bananas externally."
"The Commissioner has mentioned certain guarantees with regard to the Commission's monitoring of this issue, but as a Member of this Parliament I feel obliged to point out our concern, which is enshrined in certain amendments that have been presented in the Fruteau report and that I hope will be approved by Parliament tomorrow."
"In short, Mr President, I believe that Parliament will be able to approve this report tomorrow and probably some of the fundamental amendments, but the most important thing - I repeat - is that we can count on the Commission to carry on protecting the banana sector in the future."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, reform of the banana market affects a couple of the so-called outermost regions of the European Union."
"Its implementation is more or less a foregone conclusion, which is not at all the case for reform of the fruit and vegetable market."
"The latter involves several dozen types of fruit and vegetables and is of far greater importance for the whole Union, but is forever being delayed."
"The future of some 300 000 jobs is at stake in the banana producing regions, whereas in Poland alone some two million jobs depend on fruit and vegetable production."
"The cost of dealing with the main problems affecting the fruit and vegetable market is barely EUR 80 million a year."
"At the same time, the Union's budget would not suffer, as up to EUR 300 million is not taken up in that market every year."
"The annual cost of reform of the banana market amounts to EUR 280 million."
"This is a far higher sum, but will deal with fewer problems."
"I would remind the House that, on 1 May 2004, Poland and nine other countries became Members of the European Union and are entitled to be treated on an equal footing with other Member States."
"The fact that they are not located on picturesque islands is no excuse for failing to do so."
"In view of the situation I have described, references to a common agricultural policy can only be cause for embarrassment and shame, but it is not I who should be ashamed."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse the report by Mr Fruteau, whom I congratulate on his outstanding work, amending the Commission's proposal."
"I support the objectives outlined in the report, which are as follows: to maintain Community banana production, in view of its vital contribution to employment, to economic and social development and to safeguarding the environment in banana-producing regions, especially in the outermost regions."
"The second objective is to safeguard the incomes of banana producers and to prevent the economic situation of the banana sector from deteriorating. The third objective is to give banana-producing Member States control over the granting of aid, so that this can be done in the most effective way, taking account of the specific priorities of these regions."
"The report also provides for a specific report to be submitted by 2009 in the event of changes to the incomes of producers, for example if the tariff changes."
"I do not find it acceptable, Commissioner, to make aid contingent on producers joining a producers' organisation."
"I feel it would be more appropriate to leave the decision on such a requirement to the Member States."
"I therefore propose that this be taken into account and that the Council adopt it accordingly."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal to reform the system of production aid for banana producers is a perfect example of Article 299(2), which provides for specific treatment for the outermost regions on account of their particular characteristics, being implemented in the farming sector."
"In the outermost regions, banana production has undoubted economic, social and in particular environmental importance."
"It is vital therefore that it be maintained, and that is precisely the purpose of this reform."
"I wish to congratulate the Commission, which has outlined the right path forward: the management of aid via the POSEI programmes, greater flexibility for the Member States in distributing these resources and an end to the isolation of producers from the market, regarding which the producers' warnings must immediately be heeded."
"Lastly, the Commission must pay very close attention to the development of the sector. It may become necessary to change marketing conditions that adversely affect producers' incomes, and the Commission must respond appropriately to such a situation by taking the necessary measures."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Commission's proposed reform of the common organisation of the market in bananas is consistent with the philosophy of the 2003 reform of the common agricultural policy."
"It is also consistent with the commitments undertaken by the Union during negotiations at WTO level."
"Nonetheless, it is worth assessing the impact of the reforms on the level of banana production in the outermost regions of the Union."
"There is a certain similarity between the reform of the market in bananas and the forthcoming reform of the market in soft fruits."
"The regional market of the banana sector is just as important as the market for soft fruit."
"The degree of threat to the stability of rural areas and to the livelihoods of the growers and their families is also similar."
"Both products are very labour intensive."
"In addition, it should be noted that the market in soft fruit is under greater threat from unauthorised action by third countries than the market in bananas."
"In the case of soft fruit only temporary antidumping measures exist, while in the case of the banana market an effective single tariff system is in place."
"Some of the support mechanisms proposed for the market in bananas would resolve the difficulties of the market in soft fruit."
"The European Commission should therefore consider applying them to it, particularly the system of area payments for growers of soft fruit intended for processing."
"Let us hope that the measures proposed will have a positive impact on the situation of banana producers."
"However, we are still waiting for an account of the true costs of this reform."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to make a few comments about the questions raised here tonight."
"As I have already explained in my introductory speech, a report on the implementation of the POSEI programmes will be presented not later than 2009 and will permit the assessment of the situation in the banana-producing regions."
"If there are substantial changes in the economic conditions affecting livelihoods in the outermost regions the Commission may submit this report earlier."
"A question was raised about the situation of the producer organisations."
"It is important for me to underline clearly that producer organisations have not been abolished."
"Simply, there is no longer a need for a common definition of producer organisations at Community level."
"The vast majority of Community producers are already members of producer organisations."
"It is therefore more appropriate to let Member States decide whether they wish to adopt rules on producer organisations, which will enable them to target regional needs much more specifically and provide support under the POSEI programme."
"This is possible."
"Regional authorities will be left to make their own choices."
"This flexibility built into the system would be the best way to secure sustainable and coherent policy decisions in the outermost regions."
"There were some questions about advance payments."
"It is important that we do not forget that the new system offers a number of tangible benefits to the banana-producing farmers."
"Firstly, as soon as the POSEI programmes are approved they will have budget clarity for the full period of 2007-2013."
"This will improve their position if they need to go to the bank about loans."
"They could also obtain 100% clarity concerning the aid already paid on 1 December."
"Under the present system, they have clarity concerning only between 20% and 40% of the payments."
"It is my clear impression that the Member States appreciate these changes."
"In general, I can say with some confidence that our proposal on the budget will be very good for the banana-producing countries."
"If we had chosen other reference periods the result would have been worse than choosing the period 2000-2002."
"Therefore, I am happy that the European Parliament has decided not to reopen this discussion."
"There were a few comments on the fruit and vegetable sector."
"I am very happy to be able to say today that on 24 January I will be coming to the Committee on Agriculture to give an explanation on the new fruit and vegetable reforms."
"This will clarify some of the questions that have been raised here tonight."
"On the various proposals, the Commission supports the incorporation of Amendment 4, regarding the contribution of bananas to the social and economic cohesion, and Amendment 9, which mentions the importance of various quality standards and the link to tourism, although we might need to revise the wording slightly."
"Concerning the amendments asking to link the POSEI report to the banana sector and allow for a partial decoupling in non-outermost regions, the Commission's view is that this would clearly go against the whole idea behind the reform and also the linkage to the 2003 CAP reform."
"I wish to thank you once again for all your efforts to speed up the discussion of the banana reform."
"I am delighted that Parliament seems to agree with the basis of this whole reform and I am looking forward to the vote in plenary tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(FR) The banana plays a key role in the economies of four of the seven outermost regions, due to the importance of European markets and the exceptionally labour-intensive work that it requires."
"Our Parliament must ensure that the proposed support is set at a sufficient level and that it takes account of possible price changes during negotiations at the World Trade Organisation."
"In order to deal with a possible slump in producers' income, provision should be made for an automatic revision clause, and the current system of financial advances, which is essential to the industry's activity, should be re-established."
"Banana producers in the outermost regions are waiting for a clear signal regarding the survival of the sector, in order to restore confidence within the industry."
"Fragmented and ineffective for many years, the West Indian banana sector is today a model of organisation, and restructuring efforts in this area must be emphasised."
"I would like to point out that the banana sector in the outermost regions meets the non-commercial criteria in force within the Union, unlike its competitors in Latin American countries."
"Without the banana, which brings 15 000 jobs, representing the real economic backbone of these regions at human, social and environmental levels, the entire agriculture of Guadeloupe and Martinique would be threatened with extinction, for lack of alternative crops."
"Circulation of compound feedingstuffs (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a decision by the European Parliament and the Council correcting Directive 2002/2/EC amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feeding stuffs C6-0209/2006-."
"Member of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its actions regarding this dossier, and especially rapporteur Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who, unfortunately, could not be here today."
"The Commission's discussions demonstrate the high level of interest created regarding the issue of labelling compound feedingstuffs."
"The Commission's proposal is the logical consequence of the decision issued by the European Court, last December."
"The proposal aims at aligning our legislation, namely Directive 2002/2/EC, so that it reflects the Court's decision."
"I fully understand and acknowledge the need for political debate regarding the potential improvements on the current system of labelling compound feedingstuffs."
"I appreciate the broad understanding on behalf of the European Parliament that today's proposal is not a suitable context for this discussion."
"The modernisation and simplification of the legislation on feedingstuffs is included in the Commission's rolling simplification programme for 2007."
"The Commission is following this objective in the context of the procedure of evaluating the effects, during which interesting new ideas regarding the labelling of compound feedingstuffs will be taken into consideration, as discussed in Parliament in the past few weeks."
"As I recently stated to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the evaluation of the effects will set the path for the legislative proposal regarding the modernisation of legislation on the labelling of feedingstuffs, which is expected to be ready in the second semester of next year."
"This will give us the opportunity to study in full the best way to modernise all the provisions of the legislation regarding the labelling of feedingstuffs."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur, and not least his staff, for their commitment to this report."
"Whilst this is evidently an interesting report, it is also a controversial one, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has in any case made a correction to the Commission's proposal."
"This means that Article 1(1)(b) of the 2002 Directive needed to be deleted in accordance with the proposal that was issued further to the European Court of Justice's ruling."
"During the exchange of views, it soon became apparent that there are very different opinions about the labelling of mixed feed."
"This is not a matter of the exact designation, but of whether we really want to have a debate about the open declaration articles in the relevant legislation."
"As I see it, this open declaration should be exposed, since the present regulation in this field is not workable and still not transparent, because there are, after all, still labels around which specify 110% of ingredients."
"In addition, too little consideration is being given to the intellectual property of the feed industry which, as a result of present legislation, is forced to make its recipes public."
"This is detrimental not only to industry, but also to the farmer, for the consequence of it is that our competitors outside the European Union know exactly what we are doing."
"Also, present legislation discourages innovation in the feed industry, and that does not benefit farmers either."
"Unfortunately, it transpired that the deletion of Article 1(1)(b) was at stake and that, according to the legal offices of the Commission, the Council and of this House, meant that the other articles in the legislation could not be amended."
"I have to say that the coordinators of all parties shared this view."
"This is why the European People's Party would like a prompt review of the whole of feed legislation, not least as a means of guaranteeing complete transparency."
"When I consider the amendments, I have to say that the European People's Party is shocked that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment to another article, while their own coordinator declared this amendment to be inadmissible."
"What we in the PPE-DE Group want is a prompt review, and we welcome the Council's pledge in this respect, to carry out a complete overhaul in the first half of 2007;"
"I assume that the Commissioner will be acting in accordance with this Commission proposal to the Council."
"Mr President, my group supports the rapporteur's call for clarity and transparency with regard to the circulation of compound feedingstuffs."
"We also pay tribute to his considerable efforts to find a compromise solution."
"The discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have revealed a great variety of opinions, especially on the open declaration for compound feedingstuffs."
"Views differed not only on the pros and cons of individual amendments, but particularly on their legal admissibility."
"The reason for this was not necessarily the controversial nature of the subject alone, but chiefly the exceptionally complicated legal preliminaries to the procedure."
"At this point, I should like to remind the House that we are talking about a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council correcting a 2002 directive amending a 1979 directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs that is based on a ruling by the European Court of Justice of 6 December 2005."
"The codecision procedure has been applied, although, as a rule, the Committee on Agriculture has only the right to be consulted."
"Following much to-ing and fro-ing, advance talks with the Council produced a line that my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, can support."
"The Commission has promised to present a revised version of the whole feedingstuffs declaration next year."
"I hope this will indeed bring clarity and transparency for farmers, for consumers, for the industry and, most of all, for us politicians."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the rapporteur may well be absent, but I would still like to extend warm thanks to him, because I have the impression that, even though he has been a Member of this House for years, he has not lost any of the initial enthusiasm he displayed in the past."
"Looking back, the European Union has been faced with a number of unparalleled cattle feed scandals that have had a profound impact on policy."
"It is therefore self-evident that we cannot exercise enough care in the cattle feed sector, and there is every reason to put sound checks in place."
"The big question is whether we will resolve this if we indicate exact percentages and quantities on the label, and so this method is probably ineffective, as the content changes by the day, and I know few farmers who study every label before they decide which cattle feed to buy."
"What matters to an average farmer, an average cattle farmer, is the energy content of the feed, the protein content and the company's reputation."
"What is the role of the government in all of this?"
"Should the government always need to have a certain insight into what a certain manufacturer does, and how can this be monitored?"
"I therefore think it important that every cattle feed manufacturer in Europe should have the information available at any time in order to be able to present it to anyone who is interested, which does not mean to say that all company secrets should all of a sudden be out in the open."
"Quite the reverse; I doubt whether we can make this demand."
"There are certain experiences that are beneficial to certain factories and these can be sustained, but I think that the Commission must be able to say that as a government body or national body, it must always be able to check the cattle feed composition and the possible impact this feed has on public health."
"One of the interesting aspects of the Court of Justice's judgment was that the directive's criteria, as we know them, were not at all in proportion with the directive key objective, namely better public health."
"My burning question is therefore: the current Commission is very much in favour of less legislation, but how can this be married with the Commission's past requirements - and perhaps even today's if I interpret the proposal correctly - involving precise percentages?"
"Less regulation and at the same time an indication of exact percentages?"
"Another big area of concern for me is the fact that in seven of the Member States, the national judicial authorities have already declared the directive to be inadmissible."
"I am therefore tempted to think that the entire directive in its current form is a legal ogre; I therefore welcome the Commission proposal to table a fresh proposal at the earliest opportunity."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank our rapporteur, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has made real efforts to reach a consensus with all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I support two substantive amendments, as I believe that text that is excessively detailed and excessively well meaning often confuses rather than enlightens."
"I am in full agreement that, in case of calamities, the competent authorities need to obtain precise details of the feed materials contained in the feedingstuff concerned, and that these details must be disclosed."
"Naturally, the definition of 'calamities' is open to debate but, in my opinion, common sense will determine this in the end."
"Secondly, it is important that, as part of the simplification programme, the proposals to overhaul feed legislation be drawn up by mid-2007."
"I believe that we have all learnt from the mistakes of the past."
"We hope that the BSE crisis in the late 1990s was a one-off, an extreme situation, that will never happen again."
"I would say to the Commissioner that transparency is essential when it comes to the production of foodstuffs, in particular."
"The simplification programme for food and feed legislation is along the same lines."
"Now, more than ever, transparency and confidence in a product are unbeatable advantages in international competition for consumers; but we do have to permit international competition in Europe, too."
". - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend my thanks - which will be passed on, I am sure - to the rapporteur for his work, but I regret that the Commission has not accepted the proposal for a decision of Parliament amending the Directive of 2002 on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs."
"In fact, while the requirement to provide the authorities alone with the composition of the mixtures in the event of a crisis admittedly represents a step forward, it is not sufficient, and the issue should therefore be tackled when the legislation is reviewed by the Commission in 2007."
"It is essential that farmers using these feedingstuffs should be aware of the origin of the ingredients, whether these be vegetable or mineral."
"Different mineral and vegetable proteins have different properties, and it was for lack of information about origins that, for example, feed was found to contain rendered animal fats, leading to the infamous BSE crisis."
"Furthermore, the composition of the mixtures cannot be withheld on the pretext of protecting the intellectual property rights to the formulas."
"In carrying out their work and making up the feed ration for their livestock using some of their own produce, farmers must be able to balance the feed by supplementing it with a mixture."
"In order to maintain this balance, it is therefore crucial for farmers to be aware of the composition of the mixture that they buy."
"Farmers must remain in charge of their own affairs, and the manufacturers' monopoly must not prevent them from doing their job, especially since, in the event of a crisis, they will be blamed for misusing feedingstuffs that they know nothing about."
"In short, despite the amendments made to the Commission's proposals by this report, agribusiness and the manufacturers of feedingstuffs are still unduly favoured at the expense of farmers."
"(DE) Commissioner, today, on the basis of a ruling by the European Court of Justice, we are discussing the correction of Directive 2002/2/EC regarding the circulation of compound feedingstuffs, or the compound feedingstuffs declaration."
"The aim of this Directive is not the protection of health; in this respect, the ruling by the European Court of Justice was acceptable."
"However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development held a broad debate followed by the presentation of amendments calling for provisions on giving feedingstuff ingredients by weight and detailing these in percentages."
"I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur."
"I also support the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, particularly my amendment - which has been adopted - calling for no further-reaching amendments to be made to the legal act from now on, to enable swift action."
"The Commission has announced its intention to draw up proposals by mid-2007 to overhaul feed legislation, and it should do so."
"That would be a good time to discuss the proposals, which should take into account not only consumer issues, but also the interests of farmers in being provided with precise, detailed information on the feed materials contained in feedingstuffs, and the interest of the industry in ensuring that business secrets are adequately protected."
"It could also be a suitable time to reconsider the possibility, in future, of using high-quality animal proteins or protein components, which was of course banned following BSE and is still not accepted now."
"As we all know, only feedingstuffs containing the best, high-quality ingredients guarantee animal welfare, optimum performance and high-quality foodstuffs."
"(NL) Mr President, since the BSE crisis and the dioxin scandals, farmers and consumers have, now more than ever, been in need of reliable information about the origin and content of cattle feed."
"Clear rules in this respect are lacking."
"Effective prevention of outbreaks of animal diseases requires maximum transparency and this interest must prevail over that of industry that refuses to reveal the content of cattle feed."
"Since a compromise is well within reach, I am imploring the Commission to come up with a fresh proposal in 2007."
"The designation of all ingredients must be compulsory, but the percentages are only essential for the substances that determine the name of the product."
"Exact percentages need not always be displayed."
"The rules for cattle feed should really not be any stricter than those for human food, but the information must be displayed on the products themselves for the benefit of the users, the farmers and consumers and not kept quiet until something goes wrong, for by then it is too late."
"The Commission proposal should bring clarity to the area of ingredients."
"A transparent market is needed; farmers and consumers are entitled to this, as is the cattle feed industry."
"Unfortunately, the Conservatives and Liberals in this House have, in their amendments, been led too much by industry."
"The EU will need to make tracks in deciding in favour of rules that are in the interest of the consumer and farmer."
"No unnecessary delays; every farmer wants to know the exact content of their animal feed."
"Prevention of a new crisis requires maximum transparency that must be achieved in 2007."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Members for this interesting debate."
"I shall now continue in Greek."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to remind you that today we are called upon to decide or agree on a proposal for a decision that amends the directive, based on the decision of the European Court."
"I think that everyone agrees on this point, namely that irrespective of the opinions that each one of us has, this is not a suitable moment to discuss the full review of the legislation."
"As I have assured you before, this will take place within the next year; hopefully before the end of next year."
"I believe it is of interest, for you too I hope, that until then we will issue a report regarding the implementation of Directive 2002/2/EC, namely how this directive has been implemented by Member States, a fact that will help both our later discussion on the full review of the legislation."
"Of course, today's discussion demonstrates the high level of interest regarding the improvement of the legislation, considering that there is always room for improvement, and of course Parliament's commitment to observing established procedures."
"I am certain that Parliament will listen to our proposal by correcting, at this stage, the directive on the labelling of feedingstuffs, based on the Court's decision."
"With regard to the amendments, we will circulate a full list with the Commission's position on each one of the amendments and I hope that this list will be included in the Minutes of this meeting."
"Allow me to mention a couple of issues: The lawful ground of Directive 2002/2 is the protection of public health, something that is significantly linked to the safety of feedingstuffs, of course."
"This was confirmed by the Court's decision; this is why the Commission cannot accept Amendment 1 which would seriously undermine this principle."
"The new article that is recommended by Amendment 4, regarding the notification of the exact percentages in the event of major crises, includes something that has already been integrated in the directive in a very explicit manner."
"In such cases, the exact percentages will be given; this is why we do not consider it necessary to adopt the amendment that overrules this provision, therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendment 4."
"Once again I would like to assure you that this proposal is included in the Commission's programme regarding the simplification and improvement of the legislation."
"In other words, it has included this legislation regarding the labelling of feedingstuffs in its proposal."
"I believe that the discussion prior to this corrective decision will be taken into consideration during the formation of the new proposal, however we will, of course, have the opportunity to discuss again at a reasonable time our future proposal regarding the labelling of feedingstuffs, trying, always something that is not easy, I admit to combine consumer protection, improved consumer services with a reduction in the costs incurred by other bodies involved."
"This is our objective and we believe that through this cooperation we will succeed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12.30 p.m."

"the report by Mr Martin on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the draft Council regulation establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (11877/2006 - C6-0265/2006 -"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this regulation has been in gestation for almost two years."
"At times, the pressure on Parliament to cave in, to divide, to give up our legislative role, was barely tolerable."
"I have been taken aback by the willingness of fellow MEPs, at times, to give other institutions carte blanche in this important area, so long as some little interest of theirs or influence was not lost."
"However, I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Committee on Development - Members who did not allow pressure to divide us, across all groups, and who, in the end, carried the day."
"I should also like to pay tribute to the secretariat of the Development Committee and to the secretariats of those groups that worked constructively with us in these negotiations."
"Having threatened to reject the original Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (DCECI), as it was called, which sought to take away codecision powers by changing the legal base from Article 179 to Article 181a and to include developed countries and expenditure on non-development issues in a development instrument, we have negotiated with the Council and the Commission an instrument which few thought possible 12 months ago, one that will streamline EU activities for the developing world while maintaining accountability and transparency."
"I should like to pay tribute, in particular, to the negotiating team who accompanied me at those talks, to the successive presidencies for the work they have put in and to the Commission for a good outcome."
"I have one reservation, however."
"I believe it was Voltaire who said, 'I do not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'"
"Having approached the whole of the negotiations in a way that sought to accommodate, I was very disappointed that, on one particular issue, my views were not accommodated."
"It is not about diluting the availability of health services for women in need."
"In fact, if my amendments - which were modest - had been carried, the Cairo Conference and all the related issues would have been respected."
"Indeed, having been at the centre of compromise, finding and supporting others, I was surprised that my modest proposals did not receive proper consideration."
"Part of the reason for that seems to me to have been a piece of written advice that was circulated, which pre-empted my proposals by claiming that PPE policy had been decided."
"As the signatures to the amendments show here today, that is not the case and should not have been stated, especially at what was a very sensitive time in the concluding stages of the negotiations."
"I can support the general content of the common position, with that one reservation."
"I think it is a very good outcome for us: Parliament has gained, insofar as we have maintained codecision under Article 179, which is a very important principle to us."
"It is to be time-limited legislation."
"The specific instrument for development policy is this instrument; it will not have any other content."
"There will be more detailed financial provisions: the financial provisions of the proposal were another area of very serious concern for the Committee, as they were extremely general and very far from the level of detail to which Parliament, as part of the budgetary authority, was accustomed."
"That has now changed, and the common position now includes a breakdown of funding by programme and, in some cases, within programmes."
"We are also breaking new ground."
"The new DCI will, for the first time, enshrine in a legal text the internationally accepted definition of development policy set out by the OECD Development Assistance Committee."
"A Commission declaration attached to the new DCI will contain, also for the first time, the benchmark that the Committee on Development has been using since 2003 to promote increased focus on the key MDG sectors of basic education and basic health, and the Commission has never before accepted the Committee's 20% benchmark for these sectors, which has been accepted on this occasion."
"In relation to democratic scrutiny, further headway has also been made on the matter of the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission on the draft strategy papers to allow effective Parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI, and I wish to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Commissioner Michel for their letter to me and to the chairperson of the Committee confirming that."
"Parliament does not want, or need, to be involved in micro-management, but it does give us an opportunity, through whatever structures we decide ourselves, to get involved at an early stage, thereby giving Parliament a much improved role in the whole area of transparency and accountability."
"With the exception that I mentioned, I consider the common position as established by the Council to be a very good outcome for the European Parliament."
"As I said at the outset, I doubt very much that anybody 12 months ago would have thought that we could have achieved what we did achieve."
"But it shows that, when Parliament stands together, when the different groups do not allow themselves to be divided and are determined not to give away the powers of this House, we can, with the other institutions, come up with a very good instrument and one that ensures that the prerogatives of this House are protected."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, before turning to my own report, let me congratulate Mr Mitchell on his."
"As the House will know, these two instruments started life as a single instrument and the Committee on Development was correct to argue that they needed to be separated because we were mixing apples and pears."
"The development instrument essentially aims to promote the interests of developing countries."
"The economic instrument, the one I am responsible for, is about promoting - not exclusively, but mainly - the interests of the European Union."
"It was therefore wrong that these two objectives should have been contained in a single instrument."
"The Committee on Development was correct to argue for a separate instrument and it was also correct to argue that it should be pushing hard for the European Parliament's involvement to at least be the same as it is under the plethora of existing instruments."
"So, I congratulate Mr Mitchell on his report."
"Turning to my own report, it is small in importance compared with the other external instruments, but still a significant tool of this European Union."
"It expands on the existing programmes, firstly in terms of geographical areas: the existing programmes cover just six countries, this new instrument will cover 17 countries."
"It is expanded in terms of objectives and, as one would hope with both the objectives and the geographical area being expanded, it is also expanded in terms of its budget."
"So, while it is the smallest of the external instruments, it is still a significant instrument."
"It focuses on furthering EU interests in industrialised countries and it builds on the highly successful executive training programme for Japan and Korea and the Gateway to Japan programme."
"Both have been subject to a Commission-financed study, which demonstrates that they have increased the access of European companies in both Japan and Korea and increased the awareness of the European Community in those two countries and so are worthwhile in themselves."
"The new programme will have five key objectives: to build on public diplomacy and outreach; the promotion of economic partnership and business; people-to-people links, particularly through education; encouraging dialogues; and finally the evaluation of small-scale cooperation projects to assist small and medium-sized enterprises to get access to third country markets."
"These are all very worthwhile objectives."
"In terms of the Committee on International Trade's approach, we have concentrated on three things."
"First, given that the scope of the programmes has expanded from 6 to 17 countries, we have insisted that there is room for differentiation within the programme - a one-size-fits-all approach would simply not work in a programme like this."
"I am glad to say that the Commission has gone along with the idea that the programme should be country-specific, rather than a general programme for 17 countries."
"We have also tabled amendments to ensure that this programme is complementary to the other instruments that we will be adopting either today or at a later stage."
"Again, given that the programme has expanded, we have insisted that there should be human rights and rule of law clauses in these instruments."
"Again both the Council and the Commission have indicated a willingness to accept those amendments."
"I am also pleased to say that, despite this being only a consultation and not a codecision matter, unlike Mr Mitchell's report, the Council has agreed to attach the two interinstitutional agreements on budgetary discipline and democratic scrutiny."
"It has also agreed that Parliament should be more involved in this programme than originally envisaged and has accepted that, if the scope of the programme is altered, either geographically or in terms of its objectives, Parliament will be fully consulted."
"The Commission has also agreed to bring forward multiannual planning for consultation with Parliament on this."
"So the level of parliamentary involvement has been significantly increased."
"Finally, let me conclude by saying that there is a chance that, if we adopt all the amendments today, this instrument will be adopted by the Council in exactly the form that it leaves Parliament."
"That is quite an achievement, given that it is only a consultation exercise."
"I would like to thank the Commission for its excellent cooperation, and particularly the Finnish Presidency, which, on a relatively minor instrument compared to the other instruments, has been fully engaged in Parliament's work, has kept us fully abreast of its position and has made compromises."
"We have made compromises with the Presidency."
"I think in the end we have got a very workable instrument and I would like to thank all the institutions for their cooperation."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, this December part-session is an important milestone in establishing an effective and streamlined legislative framework for the Community's external spending."
"I must say I feel honoured that I represent the Commission in this part-session, as we are now close to concluding negotiations on the four remaining instruments for the delivery of external spending, for the future period from 2007 to 2013."
"We have all come a long way since the Commission tabled these proposals two years ago."
"The new simplified architecture was the first attempt to streamline all the instruments for external spending."
"This was deemed the highest priority for the Commission in order to increase our own efficiency and coherence and that of our external action as a whole."
"While both Parliament and the Council welcomed the simplification process, these proposals generated a very substantial debate."
"Important questions were raised soon after Parliament began its work."
"I greatly appreciate the efforts made by Parliament and the successive Council presidencies to find constructive solutions to the challenges we have encountered with these innovative proposals."
"These efforts culminated in a successful trialogue in June 2006 when an overall agreement was reached on the architecture of the external financing instruments."
"Reflecting your concern to ensure a strong development focus for the development cooperation instrument, we agreed to separate the instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries."
"A specific human rights instrument was also established."
"To address your further concerns, it was agreed that the instruments be adopted under codecision whenever the Treaty made this possible, and a separate instrument for nuclear safety cooperation was created so that the instrument for stability could pass from consultation to codecision."
"In total four of the seven new instruments are now co-decided."
"This gives Parliament a legitimate and unprecedented degree of legislative power over the framework covering external spending."
"As for the development cooperation instrument, which represents the central brick in this new architecture, I greatly appreciate the fruitful cooperation with Parliament, especially during the last five months, and I thank the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, for the central role he has played in bringing the negotiations to a positive and timely conclusion."
"I should further thank the Committee on Development's negotiating team."
"The compromise as reflected in the negotiated common position of the Council represents a finely balanced solution."
"I also appreciate that the Committee on Development endorsed this compromise and recommended the approval of the negotiated common position of the Council at second reading."
"As requested by Parliament, the development cooperation instrument now includes indicative financial allocations, a mid-term review and an expiry date."
"For the new co-decided instruments, we have also agreed that before undertaking the review Parliament should examine the operation of the instruments to identify any dysfunctional situations which may have arisen."
"Parliament's report would be considered by the Commission in carrying out the review of the instruments."
"This review should be carried out in 2009."
"In response to the letter sent by the chair of the Committee on Development, Mrs Morgantini, I am pleased to confirm that this review date will also apply to the development cooperation instrument."
"In comparison with the development cooperation instrument, and if budgetary clout is a measure of importance, the instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries does not stand out as the biggest amongst the external action instruments, but this should not lead to underestimating its utility and its relevance in enhancing the role of the European Union in the wider world."
"Indeed, this instrument will directly help promote the EU's objective of becoming a more visible player on the global stage."
"It will achieve this objective by providing a framework in which, through concrete initiatives, we can strengthen relations with key developed partners, promote Community interests, and also raise awareness about the EU there."
"Since last June, the rapporteur, the Finnish Presidency and the Commission have worked hand-in-hand to ensure a timely adoption of the instrument, while making sure that the views of each institution are duly taken into consideration."
"In this regard I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur, David Martin, and the Committee on International Trade as a whole for their hard work and the spirit of cooperation demonstrated in expeditiously processing the dossier."
"This ongoing dialogue has permitted the factoring-in of Parliament's views in preparatory discussions in the Council held in parallel with parliamentary work and therefore, thanks also to this collaborative approach, beyond the Commission's own view and without encroaching on the Council's prerogatives."
"I can envision with some confidence that key amendments regarding, in particular, references to the core values of the Community - democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights; the protection of the Community's interests; reinforced evaluation and reporting provisions for the specification of an indicative financial envelope for the period 2007-13; or the inclusion of the review clause - will find their way into the final text."
"Furthermore, additional editorial changes will bring the final text more into line with language suggested by Parliament and with language already agreed in other external action instruments, to ensure sound coherence between them."
"I am looking forward to a positive outcome to the votes on the development cooperation instrument today."
"That will allow the Commission to start its work as of 1 January and for the delivery of the external assistance without any further delay, which is so important."
"With an agreement on the remaining legislative proposals the European Union will significantly increase the effectiveness of its external spending and, in particular, its visibility on the international scene, allowing it to live up to its role as major donor of development aid."
"Similarly, I welcome the positive view taken on the industrialised countries instrument in the report that is put before Parliament today."
"I can give you a clear assurance that the final text, which the Council is set to adopt very soon, will also substantively reflect the main thrust of Parliament's resolution."
"That is a testimony to our willingness to work constructively with Parliament on this dossier, something that will continue in future in implementing cooperation activities, with industrialised countries as well."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for all his work and cooperation on this report."
"The rapporteur and I often joke that we find very little to disagree on when it comes to international trade issues."
"When it came to shadowing this report, once again we found very little to disagree on, partly because the rapporteur is such an expert in this area and has dealt with it in a number of other reports."
"I should just like to repeat what good cooperation there was, and I have actually learnt quite a lot from him throughout this process."
"One day I will find something to disagree with him about, but for now let us look at the issues."
"We all agree that the proposal should be tightened and clarified."
"It is very important that we define the EU's strategic interest, and I welcome the amendments adopted in committee to this end."
"We must also have consistency across the financial instruments."
"Once again, the rapporteur and I had a number of discussions in this area, and I am very pleased that these were adopted."
"The other area is the review clause."
"It is very important to decide whether this instrument should be reviewed during the lifetime of this Parliament or after the European elections of 2009 when new Members come in."
"Those new Members will not have our expertise in this matter, and that is why I would have preferred to have seen a review within the lifetime of this Parliament."
"Finally, the report has got it right on human rights and democracy, especially when we are dealing with developed countries."
"Let us hope that we can continue to pursue these goals within the framework of trade agreements and continue to work with our partners."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, with the new development instrument we are at last getting a piece of development legislation that will give centre stage to the Millennium Objectives, which represent a pledge we made to millions of children in Africa, a pledge that has to do with education and health care."
"Unfortunately, the bitter reality is that in recent years, the Millennium Objectives have, rather than coming closer, tended to disappear out of sight, and it was for precisely that reason that we were so tough in the debate on the present financing instrument."
"For one and a half years, we debated long and hard about this new piece of legislation; that was no mean feat, and it turned out not to be in vain."
"In the next seven years, we have one clear European Development Act which, with a clear, thematic programme and a geographic programme accounting together for nearly 70 billion, will map out the course."
"This is putting an end to 16 different regulations that are difficult to implement and monitor."
"The new Act has two clear priorities, namely the Millennium Objectives, and within these objectives education and basic health care, areas, in short, that really matter."
"The campaigns we have launched in order to achieve this have not been in vain."
"We have campaigned with school teachers' unions and many other organisations from the world of education, including Education International, in order to try to make education more central to European development programmes."
"The same applies to our campaigns involving health workers in an effort to double spending in basic health care."
"Finally, the Commission has now officially pledged to at least double its spending by 2008, with at least 20% of the geographical budget being spent on education and basic health care."
"Including the thematic dimension of the Act, this amounts to more than EUR 2.5 billion."
"With this new financing instrument, Europe, with its Member States, can now make a difference in Africa."
"There are still more than 45 million children who have no access to schooling and millions of patients, especially girls, who have to go without basic health care."
"In 2015, they will enjoy the education and heathcare provision to which they are entitled."
"This will put an end to the fight I, together with my group, have put up from the moment I took my seat as an MEP in 1999."
"I would thank all European citizens and organisations who have helped me along the way, ranging from the 'STOP AIDS Alliance' to 'Bono' - thank you!"
"On 1 January 2007, we start a fresh chapter, namely that of putting this act, along with all its principles and promises, into practice."
"This is something to which the Committee on Development will be devoting much of its parliamentary time, both in terms of programming national policy plans and of monitoring their implementation."
"We do not want a noncommittal attitude. We want 100% commitment from all parties."
"This is why we do not accept that the programming stage for the period up to 2008 should already be completed."
"Consultations with civil organisations and parliaments over there and NGOs and our Parliament over here must be done in accordance with the new agreements."
"This is incumbent on the Commission by law from 1 January."
"I assume the Commissioner is in agreement with me on this and that he is prepared to confirm this unconditionally."
"Ten days ago, the funding of the Global Fund was yet again set to jeopardise the arrangements made in respect of the thematic section for the Act of 2007."
"Fortunately, with a letter dated 8 December, the Commission asserted its willingness to respect the thematic programming arrangement for 2007."
"It would be good if the Commissioner were to confirm this, and by doing so, put the mind at rest of the 23 NGOs that will be presenting President Barroso with an urgent note on this matter this weekend."
"I would wish the President, Mr Mitchell, the Council and Commission good luck with this success."
"I am also enormously grateful to them for the thorough cooperation;"
"I do hope that this House will reject the cancellation amendment, because I think we made it clear that we no longer accept amendments."
"This Act is it; let us make it a success."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Regulation of the financing instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation presented by the European Commission two years ago to the European Parliament did not satisfy the European Parliament."
"The Regulation sought to curb the European Parliament's general decision-making powers, and it did not adhere to the principles of development cooperation policy, conflating economic cooperation with developing and developed countries."
"Today in a second reading we are discussing a differently-named document concerning a European Parliament and European Commission Regulation defining a financing instrument for cooperation that supports development."
"It was particularly important for the Committee on Development to have a financing instrument for development cooperation intended only for developing countries."
"The document submitted for a second reading is really a compromise European Parliament, European Council and European Commission document, drafted in tripartite negotiations."
"Consensus rule is back in, as is budgetary transparency and accountability to Parliament; past budget items have been returned along with detailed financial guidelines and specific development cooperation provisions."
"It should be stressed that we agreed to rely on EC Treaty Article 179, since a broad definition of cooperation in support of development and a broad choice of action according to geographical and thematic programmes is assured by consensus."
"The geographical programmes cover Latin America, Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Africa."
"The specified thematic programmes include such programmes as investing in people, management of the environment and sustainable natural resources, including energy resources, participation of non-governmental organisations and local government institutions in the development process, food security and migration, and asylum."
"It is gratifying that agreement was reached on basic education and healthcare financing and that more than 20% of the funds allocated to development will be earmarked for this, which is one of the priorities of the European Parliament Committee on Development."
"The Commission made a commitment to carry out increased and more precise monitoring of implementation."
"We regularly felt this was lacking when approving budget implementation."
"The Regulation on Financing Instrument for Development Cooperation replaced 16 existing pieces of legislation, which is a good step towards improving and simplifying EU legislation."
"I recommend that the Regulation be approved without addition or amendment."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mitchell, this House, the Council and the Commission have spent much time wrangling over the future development finance instrument, and have actually ended up finding a largely sustainable compromise."
"The intention is that the new instrument should help us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, thus forwarding a very important objective of which both the committee and this House as a whole have been recurrent defenders, and, in view of the UN's recently-published estimate of their effectiveness to date, particularly in the fight against poverty, I see the EU as sending out a very important message in that respect."
"It is evident that Mr Mitchell's dedication, as rapporteur, and that of the Committee on Development as a whole, to changing the regulation as tabled has very definitely paid off, and so, with compromise in mind, all the groups have held back from tabling amendments, although the rapporteur has not, and I have to say, with some regret, that this is where he comes in for strong criticism from me, for, rather than doing what he said he would and supporting those who want to grapple with the wording of the compromise agreement, Mr Mitchell has himself been tabling the relevant amendments, which I see as being, in many respects, highly problematic and outrageous, in that they demand nothing less than that the reproductive health of women should cease to be a goal in development cooperation; his amendments aimed at deleting Recital 18 and parts of Articles 5 and 12 do not merely do away with the wordings he finds disagreeable, contrary to what he has said, but also have the effect of removing other goals as well, among them the right to give birth free of risk and to generalised access to comprehensive, safe and reliable reproductive sexual health care and services, the reduction of infant mortality and the fight against diseases associated with poverty, particularly HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria."
"In so doing, he disregards not only the compromise already arrived at, but also world opinion as expressed at the UN conferences on population development, in Cairo, and on the situation of women, held in Beijing, and hence also the WHO's definition."
"That I regard as a scandal, and I think this House would be making itself look utterly ridiculous if it were to adopt his amendments tomorrow."
"My group will, as a matter of profound conviction, be voting against them."
"I think it makes a great deal of sense to combine the EU's aid options - which have hitherto been highly chaotic - in a single instrument, but this must not have the consequence of important matters simply being dropped."
"Since the rapporteur is questioning the compromise, I can already tell him that my group will, in future, be asking searching questions about one aspect of the new finance instrument in particular, namely the use of development cooperation resources to fund measures aimed against illegal immigration and used for the stepping up of border controls."
"Article 16(2)c introduces into this compromise something that perverts virtually the whole of immigration and asylum policy, which, as formulated elsewhere in Article 16, is a positive approach."
"You can be sure that my group, in doing this, will avail itself of one particularly positive aspect of the new instrument, namely the better opportunity given to this House to have direct input alongside the Council and the Commission, at whose insistence, significantly, trade will, in future, be included alongside the funding of development."
"Notwithstanding the fact that the first words of the new instrument stress the importance of the developing countries' trading capacities, we will be most careful to ensure that we do not embark upon a new decade characterised by the covert promotion of external trade."
"We will ask searching questions and take a critical line if, in so doing, your sole desire is to help the countries of the Global South to sell Europe the raw materials it needs without let or hindrance, for it is not selling all their raw materials, but rather fair trade with finished goods, that offers southern societies a chance to overcome poverty."
"A fortnight ago, in the Financial Times, Philippe Maystadt, the President of the European Investment Bank, warned that Europe was imposing too stringent conditions on financial arrangements to be able to compete with Chinese or Russian businesses for African raw materials."
"Where is this argument going?"
"Do we not then end up again tolerating slave labour in order not to lose the race for raw materials?"
"I find it quite remarkable, and a cause for rejoicing, that it is stated in the present financial instrument and in our compromise that the criteria to be met include that of 'decent work' on which the mind of this House is shortly to be expressed by a report."
"I believe that this sends a very important message in response to calls - which I regard as wrong-headed - for the European Union, in future, to be less exacting in its political criteria in terms of the war on poverty and the advancement of development."
"Let us instead use the new instrument, knowing how important coherence and policy are, to offer something better, with bauxite being turned into aluminium locally, using environmentally-friendly methods, by workers working under decent conditions and for living wages."
"The new instrument will have achieved something if it manages to create the conditions with respect to education and health without which productive economic performance that benefits the local community is not even possible."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, our privileged and wealthy part of the world bears a great deal of responsibility towards those who are starving and have no prospects of development."
"Of course, the aid which we provide to these people cannot solve all their problems, some of which have deeper, political causes."
"However, it can help to resolve crises."
"I think that we are unanimous in recognising our humanitarian duties, and this gives us great strength."
"That is why I am all the more opposed to the introduction of legislation relating to so-called reproductive and sexual rights, which implies our political and financial support for abortion."
"This proposal was not contained in the initial European Commission draft, and was only introduced in this Parliament."
"This sends a very negative signal to those Europeans who have moral objections to abortion and do not want to pay for activities which hide behind the façade of the technical term 'reproductive rights'."
"After all, it is a means of undermining the common front against poverty and of weakening European integration."
"Is that really what we want?"
"Can we ignore the consciences of many Christians simply because of the fact that today they are in the minority?"
"Today, we are clearly letting them know that Europe has become a project in which they will no longer play any part."
"I therefore call on you to support Amendments 1, 2 and 3."
"Without these amendments, I will not be able to vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, I see that there is a great eagerness in this Parliament to offer opinions on everything under the sun."
"Everything from extremely important issues such as chemicals legislation to small ones such as the standardisation of windscreen wipers crop up for consideration."
"We are now debating the financing instrument for the EU's development cooperation."
"I am convinced that all my colleagues in the Committee on Development want to see a reduction in world poverty so that vulnerable people around the world can live tolerable lives."
"I believe that most of my fellow Members desire the same thing."
"I should like, however, to call on them to stop and think a moment."
"Is the EU really doing everything in its power to reduce poverty globally?"
"I find it very difficult to understand how, at one moment, people can sit and recommend aid under the auspices of the EU and then, at the next moment, support subsidies for EU agriculture or a harmful fisheries agreement with a poor African country in which corruption is a major problem."
"If we really want to help poor and vulnerable people in the world, we should really come at things from another angle."
"Let us abolish the EU's common agricultural policy and protectionist trade policy and let us stop protecting non-competitive European production."
"My proposals would obviously not solve all the problems in the world, but I believe that they would be a good start."
"(SK) First of all I would like to state that in my opinion both economic and development cooperation should be included in a single financial instrument underpinned by a double legal basis, namely Articles 179 and 181(a)."
"However, I respect the conclusions of the trilateral meetings which resulted in the original financial instrument being divided into economic and development cooperation."
"The instrument used to finance cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories is financially flexible, and its expanded geographic scope reflects the current situation."
"It also considers countries that are still on the DAC list to be developing countries despite the fact that they have long since ceased to be ones."
"This includes countries like Brunei, Taiwan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar etc. These nations are important trading partners of the European Union, and it is therefore necessary to expand the existing cooperation with countries such as Japan, South Africa and Australia to include the above-mentioned new countries."
"As the countries covered by this financial instrument represent a very mixed bag, it is imperative that all treaties should include clauses on human rights and respect for democratic principles."
"In my amendments to the report, I have highlighted the need for strengthening the role of the European Parliament."
"In conclusion, I am in favour of the European Parliament endorsing every change on the list of industrialised counties and of the Commission being required to assess compliance with the original objectives and costs on a regular basis."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to express my admiration for your work."
"(NL) Mr President, since development cooperation has its own Commissioner, its own budget, and its own committee in the European Parliament, and since this House has codecision powers in this area, it has been an important sphere of activity since the beginning of European cooperation."
"The European Union is right to feel responsible for contributing to peace and prosperity in countries outside of the Union."
"The fact that the Commission has made an attempt to make improvements is a good thing."
"While we invest a great deal, the results are sometimes far from satisfactory."
"Africa is a case in point, for poverty there even appears to be on the increase."
"Much needs yet to be done in order to achieve the Millennium Development Objectives."
"The Commission's original proposal was meant to improve matters, but was, in fact, extremely disappointing and hardly confidence inspiring."
"Both the budget for development cooperation and this House's involvement were at risk of being adversely affected."
"The negotiations were not easy as a result."
"All credit to Mr Mitchell who has done a fantastic job. The upshot is that a separate development instrument will in any event remain in place, with codecision and with Article 179 as its only legal basis."
"An agreement has been reached on the priorities of the Millennium Development Objectives within which priority has been given to education and basic health care."
"This also includes reproductive health, and I should like to add, also in reaction to Mrs Zimmer, that the amendments have been tabled in order to underline the importance of this issue."
"It is incorrect to say that Mr Mitchell's amendments are opposed to reproductive health."
"He states - and I am quoting from his explanatory note to the amendments - that it is too important an issue to handle in two sentences flat, which is saying something completely different."
"The new financing instrument for development cooperation is set to change the way Parliament works; we will need to focus more on the monitoring and implementation side of programmes."
"I hope that we can count on the Commission's promised cooperation and openness in this matter."
"(ES) Mr President, this debate is important because we are going to approve the instrument that will serve as a legal basis for using the resources that the European Union allocates to development cooperation and humanitarian action."
"While the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 reduces the Union's capacity to act in almost all fields, paradoxically, the money available to us for our solidarity with the developing world is not being reduced, but rather it is increasing slightly."
"This debate provides a satisfactory end to a process that has lasted an exceptionally long time, having had to overcome serious difficulties."
"However, the instrument that we will approve has the merit of reaching the House as the result of a consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The search for that consensus was the reason for the process taking so long."
"It was a complicated challenge, since the task was to condense, into one single legal instrument, the more than fifteen previously in force over which the bases for our development cooperation actions were spread."
"It was a question of rationalising that task, and Parliament agreed with that."
"Nevertheless, it had to reject the Commission's initial proposals when, supposedly for the sake of greater efficiency, it came to restricting the House's role, that is to say, to restricting democracy."
"That was something that Parliament could not accept and our Committee on Development acted with a degree of responsibility that we should be proud of."
"Despite what some people claimed, it was not a question of promoting the role of our committee. It was a question of maintaining and increasing the role of Parliament, that is to say, the democratic responsibility of our House, in a field that is important from political and budgetary points of view."
"Many of us have had to confront totalitarian powers, which justified their authoritarianism by stating that democracy complicated procedures and made management less efficient."
"We all know what a fallacy that is, however, and that there can be no efficiency without democratic rules, both when actions are decided upon and when the executive's actions are subject to control."
"Thanks to our firmness with regard to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, and thanks to all of the groups rallying round, our efforts ended in success."
"We must thank the British, Austrian and Finnish Presidencies for the understanding they have shown towards our points of view, and also the Commission, which has sought ways to take account of Parliament's demands."
"The text of the instrument is consistent with the European consensus on development and with the various strategies that we have been approving, particularly the European strategy for the development of Africa."
"It is also consistent with the text of the Constitution, which makes solidarity with the countries of the South a constitutional priority for the European Union."
"My concern is that, having consolidated Parliament's competences, we are now going to fail to meet the responsibilities conferred on us by the instrument and which are going to require a lot of work on the part of the House, its Committee on Development, its staff, which must be increased, incidentally, if we want to be in a position to take on the work, and, above all, on the part of the parliamentary groups, whose obligations are going to be increased since they will have to contribute to the strategy documents for each country targeted by European Union development cooperation, and in monitoring the programmes that are approved."
"We must not end up in the ridiculous position of not being able to meet the obligation that we have worked so hard to obtain from the Community's institutional partners."
"(FR) Mr President, it is always a pleasure to welcome a consensus and a good result."
"I therefore join my fellow Members in doing so."
"Balance has at last been restored."
"We have a common legal instrument, expiring in 2013, and we have a mid-term review."
"We have an appropriate instrument at last."
"We have avoided confusing different terms: no mention is made of industrialised countries or human rights; only development is referred to."
"We are able to set clear objectives and point out our political priorities."
"We have, at last, an instrument that, as my fellow Members have highlighted, has its legal base in Article 179, which reintroduces the codecision procedure."
"Never again will the European Parliament be unable to co-decide on a development policy."
"We have at last managed to ensure that the financial allocations are linked to different programmes, in order to increase our control."
"I would therefore like to highlight the work of our rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, and the attention given to this matter by the Commission and the Council."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, we have taken due note of the Commission's commitments regarding our role during the mid-term review and relating to the rational anchoring of finances, to the dialogue on strategy papers and, as I would like to point out, to our priorities, namely health and education."
"To conclude, I believe that our Parliament will have no problem in adopting this report and in adopting it unamended."
"I will not waste your time by discussing these amendments, which are certainly out of touch and backward-looking and absurd in every way."
"(PL) Mr President, the idea of the European Union providing aid to nations and countries in need is worthy of our support."
"However, there are doubts as to whether political issues should be included in cooperation policy as conditions for providing this aid."
"I understand the principle of not providing aid to countries that infringe human rights or commit various crimes."
"However, using cooperation policy as a tool for forcing countries in need to adopt solutions applied in the European Union as a condition for providing aid is to put unlawful pressure on these nations and goes against the idea of solidarity."
"We will do more to promote democratic processes if we show, in our own back yard, that we can protect civil rights and freedoms and ensure respect for and the development of the values which have always been part of the European identity."
"Turning cooperation policy into a weapon for militant feminism, for example, which creates a lot of controversy in Europe itself, will undermine our status and power to act in other parts of the world."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the goal we have set ourselves - of increasing official development assistance and halving global poverty by 2015 - is an ambitious one, but it has to be said that we are a long way away from achieving it."
"My view is that development assistance has to be a short-term measure, provided where people have nothing, in regions full of refugees or countries in crisis, for example."
"In the long term, though, it cannot be a substitute for systems that actually work."
"What matters, then, is that recipients of aid be given more power over their own affairs, and that some sort of accountability be required as a means of dealing with corruption and so on."
"Africa is an example of how the way development cooperation works is not always ideal, and no wonder, when it was often used to promote the donor countries' exports, to shore up dictatorships or to drive states into debt and dependency, so it is not acceptable that China, for example, should encourage states to get back into the indebtedness from which they have only just escaped and become dependent in new ways, merely in order to secure supplies of raw materials."
"Nor, however, is it acceptable that states should be so keen to hold out their hands to receive development funds when they are unwilling to take back any of those of their own citizens who have, in droves, sought refuge elsewhere."
"Mr President, I rise to congratulate a number of my colleagues in the Committee on Development, and the rapporteur, Gay Mitchell, in particular, as well as my fellow coordinator, Mrs Martens, and all coordinators of political groups, for having conducted this matter over a period of two years to produce this result."
"Why did it take two years, one might ask, given that what we have produced now could have been done in three months?"
"It took all that time because of a very stubborn attitude from a member of the Commission - a 'commissar', one might say - who was in a senior position in DG RELEX."
"It is only because the Commissioners and the Council recognise that the European Parliament is a premier democratic institution, which must be able to criticise legislation and make it accountable."
"At a time when the European Parliament and the European institutions are being seen to be remote from our citizens, for the Commission, as it was then, to produce a piece of paper that took away the powers of the Development Committee and the European Parliament to set development policy, was outrageous."
"It is only because Parliament stood together as one, despite attempts by certain people to divide Members and to have us at each other's throats, that we succeeded in producing this."
"I want this on the record because, as a coordinator for the Development Committee, I can say we went through hell trying to get this thing passed in a way in which parliamentary scrutiny, parliamentary control of policy, parliamentary control of strategy papers, parliamentary control of time-limits on legislation and parliamentary control of specific instruments for development policy were all going to be very important."
"We must connect with our people, with our constituents, with our voters."
"To have the Commission come in, as though it had come from Moscow in the old Soviet days, was absurd."
"I say thank you very much to the Commissioners, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, in particular, and Mr Michel, for understanding that we have a democratic role to play."
"(FR) Mr President, a joint declaration on development, a strategy for Africa, commitments on levels of development aid: the EU has certainly revised its political ambitions upwards in recent years when it comes to development cooperation, and this new financing instrument gives us a tool to match our ambitions."
"A financing programme over seven years, devoted entirely to international solidarity, really is a great victory for our partners in the South, and it is a great victory for us here in Parliament, because, after two years of locking swords with the Council and the Commission, our main demands have been met."
"It is a victory in terms of the commitment to allocate at least 20% of appropriations to the education and basic healthcare sectors, in order to increase the pace of progress on the Millennium Goals; it is a victory in terms of the creation of a specific instrument to fund the promotion of human rights and democracy in the countries of the South; and it is a victory in that it limits the scope of the new instrument to the countries of the South alone, in order to ensure that development appropriations are not siphoned off to other policies."
"It is a pleasant prospect, which now allows us to conclude the process of examining this text in peace. These victories will give rise to others, for example the ongoing negotiations on the programming of the European Development Fund (EDF), which I, as rapporteur, will make every effort to give the same priorities."
"Although it is true that, despite our best efforts, we have not managed to achieve the budgetisation of the EDF or to get officially involved in the comitology procedure, in order to keep a closer eye on the implementation of development policy, we should nevertheless be delighted at our many victories, the most important of which is the promotion of a generous view of development policy."
"In establishing this development cooperation instrument, the European Union is, more than ever, establishing itself as a leader in this field."
"It was already by far the biggest donor in the world in this domain, and it was already doing more than the rest of the world for international solidarity."
"From now on, it will do even better!"
"I believe that, today, Europe can be proud of the fact that it has remained loyal to its values of generosity and solidarity."
"I, too, would like to echo what has been said, and to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, all those who have worked towards this result - particularly Mr van den Berg - and all those who have made such valuable contributions to it."
"I hope that this report will be adopted without amendment."
"(ET) The financial instrument for development cooperation involves a very fragile compromise between the commission, the Council and Parliament."
"We must also recognise that Parliament's views have largely been taken into consideration during the codecision procedure."
"Any proposal to add a new instrument would mean that the instrument would not be implemented from the beginning of the following year, and the aid might not even reach those who need it."
"The instrument will cover a broad range of developing countries, from the very least developed countries to high-income countries."
"The instrument will also cover a wide range of topics and include activities that were previously financed from the environment budget."
"I am satisfied with the course of the proceedings, during which the European People's Party has removed those motions to amend that contained mention of political institutions, and thus I will offer a brief conclusion."
"I would like to emphasise once again that the financial instrument for development cooperation is a compromise between institutions, and the slowing of its processing would mean the delaying and interruption of aid, which certainly does not serve the instrument's purpose of promoting democracy and human rights."
"I therefore support the passing of the report without any amendments."
"(EL) Mr President, my intervention refers to Mr Martin's report, whom I must congratulate on his creative contribution."
"His report refers to the financial instrument for developing cooperation with industrialised countries and territories."
"The discussion regarding the institution of the said financial instrument is part of a wider problem that concerns primarily the harmonisation of the European Union's actions in foro interno, in foro externo and secondarily the cohesion of the European Union's entire foreign activity, whether political, financial or commercial."
"In particular, the proposed regulation unites a heterogeneous group of countries as well as a wide range of activities in fields such as economy, commerce, research and scientific cooperation."
"Distributing resources per field of activity on the one hand, and per country or group of countries on the other, should reflect the European Union's strategic, political, financial and commercial objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with respect to the cohesion of European Union's foreign activity I would like to refer to the new trade strategy that the Commissioner on International Trade, announced."
"Given that this strategy concerns our next steps with important European Union trade partners, is a compatibility issue regarding the European Union's political priorities being raised?"
"Does it connect the range of subject matters covered by the proposed financial instrument with European Union's internal political choices?"
"Moreover, should not it promote even more the European Parliament's active role in the determination of priorities as well as the evaluation of programme effectiveness?"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are having this joint debate, since we will end up, in future, with a shared legal basis differentiating between developing countries and richer, industrialised nations, and so it is good that we should be discussing this today."
"Mr Martin, the rapporteur, was right to point out that we have to seek after a more logical and systematic approach when it comes to defending the European Union's interests in our cooperative efforts with others, and I am glad that the Commission treated with respect his argument that further differentiation is needed, along with consideration of the countries' specific interests, more evaluation, and an early review."
"I would like to add a couple of other points, which Mr Papastamkos has already addressed."
"When this review is carried out, this differentiation must be reflected even more logically in our dealings on the foreign policy and trade policy fronts."
"What I mean by that is that we currently maintain very intensive relations with certain countries, with free trade agreements and partnership agreements, but the thinking on the basis of which we cooperate using financial instruments is not always in line with our thinking about policy."
"It follows that we should strive after greater strategic depth in financial cooperation too, for there is no point in having free trade agreements - with Mexico or Chile, for example - and having more of their kind in mind for the future, while not being logical in our cooperation; it is just as illogical to deny the least developed countries more intensive support than that given to those that are already on their way up and can be described as emerging."
"It is in just this way that we need to become more specific in future, and I might add that that also involves Parliament being consulted not only on the financial instruments as part of the codecision procedure, but also as soon as dialogue towards the conclusion of bilateral agreements is embarked on, and that its agreement shall be an indispensable requirement, for this House's involvement will otherwise result only, in the final analysis, in a wedge being driven between the Commission and the Member States, and that will make full and democratic support quite simply impossible."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, as a matter of urgency, to stress, in the debates involving the Commission and the Member States, the necessity of Parliament's approval being given in all areas, so that our system of values - about which we talk unceasingly - may remain intact not only when we talk about other countries, but also when we make policy for ourselves."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Mr Mitchell and the coordinators, and to congratulate them for managing to assert, through shared moral values, the will of a directly elected Parliament, which they have achieved in part thanks to our support."
"Development cooperation must lead to development and not to stagnation."
"It must lead to the rule of law, to the development of a free economy and, in turn, to pluralism in decision-making and respect for human rights."
"As many countries in the world have shown, economic development is not in itself sufficient."
"The pursuit of economic openness and rapid economic development is not enough when, in the absence of the rule of law, there is political stagnation, a closed society, corruption and the usurpation of power."
"Economic development of this kind leads to serious political failures and security problems, and ends in terrorism."
"We in Parliament have at our disposal an instrument whereby we can place conditions on development aid, guiding and earmarking it so that criteria are properly met and genuine development is achieved."
"This instrument lays down precise financial conditions and provides for precisely controlled funding for development programmes, including those of non-state beneficiaries and local authorities."
"With everyone better off, it will be possible for Parliament to influence the final form of national strategic documents and to assess their implementation."
"Speaking as a member of the Executive Committee of the World Movement for Democracy, I welcome the possibility of promoting genuine democracy via our democratically elected Parliament."
"I should just like to promise that, in common with the other Members of this House, I shall make every effort to ensure that we work effectively in conjunction with the Commission and the Council to achieve development throughout the world."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Mitchell and Mr Van den Berg on their excellent work on the development cooperation instrument."
"I have to say, though, that I strongly oppose the amendments put forward by Mr Mitchell on recital 18, Article 5 and Article 12."
"In a few days' time we will not have a separate line for the funding of sexual and reproductive health rights and I think it would be a grave injustice, in particular to the women who are at risk from very serious illnesses in maternity, to remove these references."
"We are committed in various agreements already made by the European Parliament with the Commission, with the Council and in international agreements, to precisely the language that is contained already in this DCI, and it strikes me as disingenuous for Mr Mitchell to offer by way of explanation for these amendments the assertion that these matters cannot be dealt with in two lines."
"These issues have been debated ad nauseam by this House and by most national parliaments and the outcome is always the same in this Parliament."
"This Parliament stands behind the rights of people to choose independently their sexual activity, their sexual proclivities and their right to proper health services and to prevent the appalling death toll of something like 90 000 women who die annually as a result of backstreet abortions."
"We need to end that and I believe we should leave the report as it stands."
"(LT) Today the congratulations are ringing out particularly loudly for rapporteur Mrs Mitchell, who has achieved a good compromise after two years of negotiations with the Council over a very important matter."
"For the first time we have a definition of development policy that allows resources for the support of development cooperation to be directed only to those countries that are most in need of them."
"One fifth of the funds will go to the areas of healthcare and education, which is socially equitable support for countries trying to liberate themselves from the stranglehold of poverty, disease and inadequate education."
"It is very important that Parliament will be able to exercise ongoing control and to have an effect on the allocation of funds."
"The compromise which is being worked out shows that this is essential."
"I believe that developing countries will hail this constructive step of the European Parliament and the European Commission, which enables us to hope that the funding of EUR 17 billion will be allocated thoughtfully, with maximum benefit to people facing the greatest adversity."
"It is important to spread this news within European Union countries as well, particularly in the new Member States."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Mitchell and Mr van den Berg on the success of this report, which focuses on simplifying how EU aid would be spent in developing countries."
"I also would like to state that unfortunately I will not be able to support the amendments that Mr Mitchell has tabled, for the same reasons as outlined by Mr De Rossa."
"As he said, this is an issue that has been gone over on a number of occasions, both within Parliament and internationally."
"I believe that we should stick to the agreements that have been there since Cairo."
"'The US fights, the UN feeds and the EU funds'."
"Those are the words of a French international affairs student."
"However unfair, that paints a picture of the importance of the EU to developing countries."
"In recent years, the world has been tragically hit by disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes in Pakistan and the recent flooding in Bangladesh."
"The United Nations fund CERF was designed to fund and provide a rapid response to any sudden global emergencies and to provide critical funding which has already been put in place by international donors."
"In the first five months of this year, CERF has provided EUR 200 million to more than 320 projects in 26 countries."
"However, ECHO has refused to contribute to CERF to date, arguing that it has its own rapid funding mechanism for swift and even-handed funding in emergencies."
"I would argue: what is the point in having two funds supposedly achieving the same goals?"
"Why not have one central fund which deals with these emergencies?"
"I would urge the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid, Mr Michel, to open a line of discussions with the United Nations to streamline the global response to international emergencies."
"Bureaucracy must not get in the way of saving people's lives, because that is what we are talking about."
"Let us not fight over two different funding blocs when the aim is to feed and fund the people who have been hit by disasters as quickly as we possibly can."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I wish to thank you once again for this closing debate."
"We had long negotiations, which at times were not easy, many formal and informal trialogues."
"As always, every party has to make its points clear, and sometimes that takes time."
"However, the important thing is that we get a good result in the end."
"I have listened very carefully to all of you and I think we can all live with this result and we can look to the future."
"There is now a new set of financial instruments and we want to ensure better external action and better visibility in favour of development, stability and human rights."
"Let me now say a few words about some specific items mentioned in the debate."
"On the question of sexual and reproductive health and rights, I am aware that the issue is of a very sensitive nature wherever it has come up in all the different fora."
"It becomes an even more complex matter in a Union of 25 Member States, all of which have their own different traditions."
"For this reason, the respective provisions in the Development Cooperation Instrument represent a finely balanced compromise, which I admit was difficult to achieve and which should not be reopened."
"These provisions are largely taken from the old regulation on aid for actions on sexual and reproductive health and rights in developing countries."
"Hence, these provisions already reflect a certain consensus as the old regulation was approved by Parliament in codecision."
"Transferring the issue from the Development Cooperation Instrument to a separate regulation would not facilitate the problem, but rather protract the discussions on this very sensitive matter."
"Such a solution would also go against the aim of simplification, which was the guiding principle for the reform of the external action instruments."
"The respective provisions on the Development Cooperation Instrument reflect a balanced compromise, which most likely would not be improved by regulating the issue of sexual and reproductive health in a separate regulation."
"I should also like to say a word on the question of the main thrust."
"The Commission reaffirms that eradication of poverty and the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals are at the core of the primary objective of its development assistance."
"The Commission commits itself to prioritising basic health and education and social cohesion as a whole in its programming and implementing role for country programmes."
"Moreover, the Commission will endeavour to ensure that a benchmark of 20% of its allocated assistance under country programmes covered by the DCI will be dedicated by the year of review, 2009, to basic and secondary education and basic health care."
"But I also have to say that the DCI also contains a thematic programme on migration and asylum, which is the successor of the old AENEAS programme."
"The contents of this thematic programme are the expression again of a finely balanced compromise, in particular with the Member States in the Council."
"In the light of the challenges which the European Union is currently facing in the field of migration, the thematic programmes will respond to those needs."
"Indeed the root causes of migration will primarily be addressed through our geographic cooperation - I have just spoken about that."
"Those who have prospects will not migrate, but there are many others."
"It is combating illegal migration on the one hand, and working for legal migration on the other."
"We must not close our eyes to the fact that migration, and especially illegal migration, is one of the big challenges of our time that we have to face."
"I look forward to putting those instruments to work, together with you."
"We have to look to the future."
"One of the most challenging questions throughout the negotiations on these new co-decided instruments was the role of Parliament in the strategic planning, as expressed in the strategy papers."
"Based on the declarations attached for the interinstitutional agreement on the new financial perspectives, the modalities of a democratic scrutiny dialogue have been fleshed out in an exchange of letters with the committees concerned."
"The first pilot country strategy paper will soon arrive in Parliament."
"We now look forward to the implementation of that democratic scrutiny dialogue."
"Regarding the ICI, I should like to say to Mr Martin and Mrs Mann that, as you know, the legal base is Article 181(a) of the EC Treaty, which foresees the consultation procedure with Parliament in the legislative process."
"But of course the Commission is always ready to exchange views with Parliament on aspects of cooperation with industrialised countries too."
"We will certainly take the utmost account of any resolution that Parliament might adopt in that respect."
"If, in the developing countries, we have not yet always seen the results we wanted to see, that is also because sometimes good governance has not yet been achieved."
"That is another very important factor I should like to highlight because we are providing a lot of funding and we try to do our best."
"Unfortunately, however, sometimes good governance is not there."
"In conclusion, negotiations are always complicated, but what we wanted to have was simplification."
"It is so important to simplify in order to achieve visibility and efficiency."
"Reducing more than 40 different legislative instruments to seven policy-driven instruments has been difficult but I believe that in the end it has been a rewarding challenge."
"Three new instruments are already in force: pre-accession, the neighbourhood policy instrument and the stability instrument."
"Four instruments will be adopted shortly: the DCI and the ICI, the nuclear safety and the human rights and democracy instruments."
"Everyone who has spoken today of the positive results of our negotiations on the DCI and the ICI has also seen that."
"What this whole exercise has shown is that if we, the three institutions - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - work together in a constructive manner, in the end we can produce results of quality."
"Again, I look forward to working together with you to secure a really good, efficient and visible implementation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon today."
"Protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration (debate)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the environment is a broad field; all human life on our continent is dependent on both air and water, and groundwater is among the most important and most vulnerable resources that we humans possess."
"It recovers lost quantity only very slowly, and regains its original state only very slowly after pollution; cleaning polluted groundwater can be done, if at all, only at enormous expense and with recourse to enormous technical resources."
"Our experience with air is currently teaching us that all the measures we have taken over the past decade have proved insufficient to prevent climate change and all its deleterious side-effects."
"Where air is concerned, we in Europe can accomplish relatively little unless other industrial states around the world lend a hand."
"Where groundwater is concerned, here in Europe, we alone have the power to secure this precious good for future generations, and in that the precautions we take and the protection of the groundwater ecosystem are of the utmost importance."
"This has been my core concern, the thing for which I, as rapporteur, have fought, and I am grateful to all those who have supported me in this, by which I mean primarily you, the Members of this House, for, without your convincing votes at first and second reading, we would not have been able to achieve the result that we did in the conciliation negotiations with the Council, even though we had the Commission's support."
"I would like to thank the Council and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation and for their support in the quest for compromises."
"What, then, have we achieved?"
"The protection of the groundwater ecosystem and the precautionary approach have been explicitly included, the latter of which meaning, with regard to groundwater, that water that is still clean must be kept in good or very good condition."
"It means not leaving action until the conditions defined by the limit and threshold values as 'poor' have already come about."
"The reversal of trends and deterioration are regulated in such a way that not only the transition from good to poor conditions, but also ongoing increases in values within a category are considered and have to trigger action."
"When laying down the threshold values for the materials described in part B of Annex 2, the Member States shall be required to take account of knowledge concerning toxicity to humans and the environment as well as of hydrological conditions, in other words, of background levels, in order to be able to take better account of the differing conditions from one European region to another."
"For the purpose of reviewing the effectiveness of these measures, the introduction of a review clause was especially important."
"The observation on the Nitrate Directive in Annex 1 was deleted and the reference to it in Annex 4 has been expanded."
"The targets for protection and repair laid down by the Nitrate Directive and the Water Framework Directive in conjunction with this Groundwater Directive, which is derived from them, are comparatively stringent, and the new Article 11, on evaluation, is important in this regard."
"The Commission's reports on groundwater must include an assessment of this directive in its relation to other relevant environmental legislation - such as the Nitrate Directive - and of the degree to which it is in harmony with it."
"The wording of the directive has now been made clearer and less ambiguous, with concepts such as 'background concentration', 'starting point', or 'significant upward trend' being defined, and requirements that are unclear or open to reinterpretation being deleted."
"Where its implementation is concerned, the Member States are allowed more scope for devising their own solutions, with the possibility left open of contractual agreements between, for example, farmers, water treatment companies, and local authorities, and, when the directive is adapted in future, this House will be allowed more scope for its own input, since the new comitology procedure enables it to raise objections when the lists of pollutants, indicators and limit values are altered, and its consent is required before specific substances can be deleted from the list."
"The rural development regulation makes it possible for agriculturalists to be compensated for losses of income sustained by them in consequence of constraints imposed on their management of their land in order to protect groundwater."
"We sought compromises, and we have managed to find them."
"I am firmly convinced that we will be able to sustain and defend all this."
"There are some irregularities remaining in the various language versions, and I ask the language service to iron them out."
"The new groundwater directive will be an effective aid in protecting our groundwater, and so I ask all of you to vote to accept that which has emerged from the Conciliation Committee."
"Member of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I would like to both congratulate and thank the Parliament delegation that participated in the Conciliation Committee on 17 October."
"In particular I would like to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who chaired the Parliament delegation and rapporteur Mrs Klass on their outstanding work and the result they achieved."
"The Conciliation Committee's discussions were constructive."
"As stated before by Mrs Klass, Parliament achieved positive results on certain important issues, especially on the vital issues of prevention of deterioration of groundwater and establishing quality standards for groundwater."
"I am positive that Parliament will endorse the good results achieved by its delegation."
"The European Commission supports the document that was adopted by the Conciliation Committee."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) When I entered the European Parliament two and a half years ago, I must admit I was afraid my fellow Members and I would become part of a Babelish confusion, and in fact, we would be able to do very little in terms of making decisions affecting half a billion citizens in Europe."
"Well, now I am standing here and I can say that yesterday we helped to deliver the new chemical industry law, and today I may be actively involved in delivering another piece of legislation offering great hope: the law on groundwater protection."
"I have spoken a great deal with Mrs Klaß, whom I would like to thank at this point for her selfless efforts, about how important and significant this law is. About how we cannot be allowed to pollute the water we drink, without which life on Earth cannot be sustained."
"It is not that anyone would have argued against the principle of it, but when it got down to the nitty-gritty, touching on actual cooperation between Member States, nitrate limit values and protection zones, some countries started giving their own interests priority over the Community's interests."
"Finally, however, common sense prevailed and the agreement was adopted."
"As a result of the successful 'trialogues', every citizen in Europe, regardless of whether their country shares a groundwater base with another country or not, is now in the same position, and will be able to enjoy a considerably higher level of water quality and safety than before."
"It is now up to the Member States as to how they implement this law, how they integrate groundwater protection into their rural development policy and how they encourage agricultural practices to be adapted to this new directive."
"Congratulations to Mrs Klaß, the Commission and Council on this water protection law which is of great importance to Europe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Klaß and the other Members for their work on the drawing up of this report."
"I believe the result to be positive, thanks to the work of this House, which has improved it considerably, to the efforts that the Commission has made in helping us, and also, lastly, to the understanding of the Council in the Conciliation Committee."
"Groundwater provides around 65% of all of Europe's drinking water."
"The fact that we have obtained a definition of deterioration and that precaution and prevention are now seen as a principle, is really very positive."
"In order to protect the environment as a whole and human health in particular, we must prevent and reduce the dangerous concentration of harmful pollutants in groundwater, I believe that this Directive is moving very much in the right direction."
"The quality of water and, hence, the health of human beings are threatened by the presence of high concentrations of nitrates, pesticides, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and a long list of pollutants."
"I am therefore particularly pleased with the agreement that we have reached with the Council, which will make it possible to implement a whole series of rules for preventing pollution and protecting groundwater."
"These rules will oblige the Member States to prevent or restrict the entry of dangerous substances into groundwater, and in this field it is also very important that we take account of the different hydro-geological conditions in the different regions of Europe, because soil that continuously receives water is not the same as dry soil, which faces other kinds of problems."
"Furthermore, I would like to stress the possibility for the Member States to establish protection areas of a size that the water authority, or other competent national body, considers necessary in order to protect drinking water supplies."
"I believe that this is one of the most important elements to have been introduced."
"I would like to end by calling on the Members to vote in favour of this report and I hope that the States will implement these measures as soon as possible, with a view to preserving the environment and protecting human health, thereby moving us in the direction of the sustainable Europe that we all want to see."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, my congratulations to the rapporteur Mrs Klaß, the EP delegation chairwoman, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Commissioner Dimas, the Council and all those who have made it possible for this directive to go through conciliation successfully."
"Many will say that this directive is long overdue, and they are most probably right."
"But, as my English colleagues wisely say, better late than never."
"Many will also say that this directive does not go far enough in ensuring the utmost protection of our groundwater and they, too, are probably right; but when the issue at hand is so complicated and when the stakes and stakeholders involved are so numerous and significant, the need for an agreed compromise is paramount and essential."
"Indeed, some compromises were made, for example on nitrates and on the revision clause period, but these were part of an overall balanced and fair agreement."
"On the other hand, issues like the protection of public health being sufficient justification for laying down more stringent limit values for pollutants such as pesticides were correctly re-emphasised in the directive."
"Additionally, and most significantly, reference to the water framework directive was justifiably included in a recital."
"But, perhaps most significantly, the EP delegation secured a broader role for Parliament in future decision-making and consequently a role in overall surveillance of correct and adequate implementation."
"Indeed, implementation is an area where I feel that weaknesses may emerge and it cannot be emphasised too strongly that a watchful eye and strict adherence to the rules and regulations must be achieved if we are to secure high quality of our valuable groundwater reserves for ourselves and for future generations of Europeans."
"In conclusion, we have before us a balanced and most satisfactory compromise that deserves our full and undivided support."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Klaß, Commissioner, that the groundwater directive has not been watered down amounts to a tremendous success, and the proposals now made are a real step in the right direction, although we would, of course, have expected even more."
"As we know, 80% of all drinking water is derived from groundwater, but 40% of Europe's groundwater is already polluted."
"In Germany, the pollution of rivers in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria through fluorinated tensides has made it abundantly clear in just what peril our number one nutrient now is."
"That the groundwater directive now contains a legally binding ban on the introduction of pollutants into groundwater must be counted a success, and it is to be hoped that this will bring in strict and efficient measures for sustainable water protection."
"It is cause for rejoicing that Parliament has torn up the 'shopping list' of derogations from second reading, and fortunate that the agricultural lobby's feeble excuses for upper limits on nitrate have been thrown out; even farmers have to comply with the 50 microgram/litre tolerance limit, which is not actually that much to expect of them."
"Nitrate is associated with cancer, and it has been found in Germany in concentrations of up to seven times those that are permitted, which makes it abundantly clear just how disturbing the situation is."
"If this precious resource of ours is to be effectively protected, what we could actually do with is a limit value of less than 25 micrograms per litre."
"Nitrates pollution continues to be the biggest and the most expensive problem where the protection of European groundwater is concerned, and so I regard it as seriously negligent of this House, and the Council too, to fail to push the case for protection against nitrates in order to set ambitious targets for it, but the fact that it has been confirmed and laid down that groundwater is, as such, to be protected, constitutes a major triumph."
"We still know too little about the characteristics of our ecosystem, for preventive protection of groundwater is ten times as beneficial as measures to clear up the damage after it has been done, which are, in many cases, impossible."
"We need to adopt the groundwater directive, and it must be the starting point for further measures to protect the environment."
"In the forthcoming process of producing legislation on pesticides, I shall, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, be paying very special attention to the maximum quantities of pesticides in groundwater, for it is important that that be dealt with if the groundwater is to be better protected."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Directive on the protection of groundwater from pollution and deterioration is a necessary document."
"It will have a positive effect on access to drinking water and water used in farming and industry, of which there is a shortage in many regions within the European Union."
"Water is an economic and humanitarian matter in these regions."
"Water shortages and the poor quality of the water available mean that it often needs to be delivered to holdings, where people work and live, from places ranging from a few to more than a dozen kilometres away."
"The Directive does not restrict the implementation of national policies, which take into account the specific circumstances of individual countries."
"It is a document which represents a compromise between our wishes and reality."
"In its approved form, it is a document that is worth adopting."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Klaβ, for her work."
"The UEN Group will support the jointly approved text of the Directive."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Klaβ warmly on the result achieved."
"Although the circumstances with regard to groundwater can be very different and the effects do not always extend across the border, it is useful nevertheless to have the prospect of a sound groundwater directive."
"We have even managed to bring in the more ambitious requirement that the quality of groundwater should not deteriorate, and so, rather than fighting a running battle, we really are clamping down on pollution."
"I am pleased that the directive has taken into consideration the specific protection measures that are already in place in some Member States, and I say that with particular reference to Denmark, which applies strict standards for pesticides on account of the fact that groundwater is used directly as drinking water."
"Although the Treaty already provides for this, it is good that this directive explicitly confirms that Member States are allowed to take further action."
"Finally, I should like to add that the option of withdrawing the current Nitrate Directive should be given serious consideration."
"The objective, a limit value for nitrate, has already been laid down."
"An effective regulation for the measuring method is also in place now."
"The Nitrate Directive is now only about the means to achieve this end."
"As I see it, the means should remain secondary to the end."
"The mother can now throw away the bathwater with confidence, because the baby has now been washed, the mother, of course, being the framework directive on water, the bathwater being the Nitrate Directive and the daughter being the Groundwater Directive."
"Madam President, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have all talked much of better regulation and removing duplication."
"Yet here we have a new groundwater directive not to consolidate or replace, but to supplement, the existing directives: the Water Framework Directive and the Nitrates Directive."
"The overregulated farmer, instead of having one clear-cut directive with which to comply, has to contend with aspects of four directives on this subject."
"So, far from the promised rationalisation of legislation, we seem to be seeing more proliferation."
"As for the assurance that loss of income suffered by farmers as a result of restriction on farming practices can be offset under the Rural Development Regulation, that is of no comfort in a country like the United Kingdom, where a large part of the funding for rural development is coming from the farmers themselves, through top-slicing their single farm payments via the misnamed 'voluntary modulation'."
"(DE) Madam President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Klaß for the outstanding work she has done."
"When one first comes to the subject, one asks oneself who actually can be opposed to the protection of groundwater; one ought, of course, to immediately answer that question with 'nobody', but, as we see, we have among us a number of Members from the United Kingdom who still take the view that these are rules and regulations of which we have no need."
"It must, though, be clear to anyone that our primary source of sustenance, on which we depend for our existence more than on anything else, needs to be protected."
"Perhaps the news has reached even the United Kingdom that groundwater does not stop at national borders, and that is why we have the task of enacting regulations applicable to Europe as a whole."
"What is being taken here is a first step, and in that respect at any rate, Mrs Breyer has got it right."
"We must keep on working on this, but let us just remember that we have laid down standard values for pesticides and for nitrates, and the Member States are mandated to specify, subject to their own national circumstances, limit values for ten other pollutants."
"We have managed, through tough negotiations, to bring in a prohibition of deterioration."
"All these things are milestones as we journey in the right direction, and it really would be completely wrong to say that Europe is doing nothing in this area."
"Perhaps I might also point out that it is now, in fact, possible to use European funds to compensate for the losses in income of which some Members have spoken, and so, in other words, the European Union is helping, by making the necessary funds available, the farmers, some of whom would certainly find implementing this problematic."
"It is also for the Member States to put in place comparable rules by way of standardised measurement and testing procedures."
"As I see it, we have taken a very good step in the right direction, but it is only a first step, and we have more work to do."
"I think it would be fundamentally wrong to demand 'less Europe' in this area."
"(DE) Madam President, I too would like to join in the congratulations to our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß; the adoption of this compromise from the conciliation committee brings us to the end of the process of legislating on this extremely important matter."
"Groundwater is the most vulnerable of the European Union's fresh water resources, and is one of the main sources for the public water supply not only in my own country but also in many other European regions."
"Uniform standards for the most important pollutants, applicable right across Europe, are essential to the protection of our groundwater, for it is these alone that can prevent distortions of competition and environmental dumping."
"This directive lays down limit values for nitrates and pesticides right across Europe, leaving it to the Member States to bring in their own threshold values for other pollutants such as arsenic, mercury, lead and chlorine."
"The limit value laid down for nitrate is 50 mg."
"It is fortunate that this House's demands, and the pressure it brought to bear, meant that the derogations provided in the Common Position in respect of agricultural activities could be deleted, for it is still the case that agriculture is primarily responsible for the pollution of our groundwater in many European regions, and if it is to be better protected, the practices of those engaged in agriculture and forestry in many parts of Europe will have to change."
"The directive on the protection of groundwater obliges the Member States to take all action necessary to prevent hazardous substances finding their way into groundwater."
"That they will in future be obliged to actually take these steps and will no longer be allowed merely to aim to do so is another of the significant triumphs of the conciliation process."
"Even though the right of the Member States to take more stringent measures is already specified in the treaties, I am delighted that this principle has once again been explicitly entrenched in the groundwater directive."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is one of the most abundant resources on the planet: the oceans and seas cover 70% of the Earth's surface and produce three quarters of the oxygen we breathe."
"However, we can only actually use 1% of this water, and many human activities are putting a major strain on the resource."
"Polluted water, regardless of where the pollution comes from, gets back into nature one way or another, and is therefore liable to harm human health and the environment."
"This proposal for a directive is a step forward for the protection of groundwater and in preventing its deterioration, because it provides for compliance with the precautionary principle, specifically in Article 6."
"It will now be the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent and limit the discharge of hazardous substances by defining zones to guarantee the protection of the bodies of water in question."
"Farmers will be able to obtain compensation to cover the loss of revenue attributable to the obligations imposed in the protection zones, particularly in drinking water catchment zones."
"Parliament will also be more deeply involved in future decisions, because it will be able to oppose amendments to the list of pollutants."
"I would therefore like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, and Mr Florenz and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the tenacity they demonstrated during the negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"Parliament's delegation succeeded in toughening the obligations imposed on Member States with regard to the protection of groundwater."
"Under these circumstances, I recommend that we adopt the joint draft at third reading."
"(SV) Madam President, we have reached agreement, and it is now important that these things be properly implemented."
"I should, of course, have liked the Member States to have been forced to take measures whenever a tendency to exceed the limit values is noted instead of once we have already damaged the groundwater irreparably."
"In spite of everything, however, this compromise has its advantages."
"I am particularly pleased about the opportunity it gives countries to ban dangerous chemicals throughout their territories in order to protect their drinking water."
"I think that this is a good addition."
"We must remember that, in the future, it is climate change that may be still more of a factor in destroying the groundwater."
"It is important for us to take measures to combat climate change, as a further problem will arise if there are floods that sweep through, for example, poison stores in factories, causing the poison to end up in our watercourses and then to sink down into the groundwater."
"Firstly, then, we need the Groundwater Directive, but we must solve the climate problems if we are to have a chance of protecting the groundwater in the future."
"Madam President, I also wish to thank Mrs Klaß and the parliamentary team."
"At this stage in the process so much has been said that I shall use this minute to recall some basics on groundwater."
"It is important to remember that groundwater is very different to surface water, which moves in a continuously renewing cycle of flow, evaporation, precipitation and flow."
"Only some groundwater is renewable and it can take water a very long time to percolate through the layers of the Earth's crust to renew the underground source which we can so quickly deplete. Some sources of groundwater are not renewable."
"We sink wells which, once exploited, go dry."
"Lastly, pollution works in two ways."
"Groundwater may be safe to use or it may not."
"During the UN International Water Decade in the 1980s, deep bore wells were drilled in parts of water-starved India."
"By the end of the decade people were beginning to show symptoms of skeletal sclerosis."
"Now six million people suffer from severe skeletal sclerosis and 66 million to a lesser degree from naturally contaminated water."
"As we search for more sources of water, it is important that groundwater be protected from pollution, but it is also important to remember that protection from pollution works two ways."
"Madam President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, and the Chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for this very good report and for the agreement that was achieved with the Council."
"Clean water is, clearly, vital to life, and we are fortunate in Europe to have, at least relatively speaking, an abundant supply."
"We must maintain, and indeed improve, the quality of that supply, reversing the damage already done."
"I believe that in Ireland, in particular, considerable damage has been done by illegal landfill sites and the abundant spreading of pig slurry by farmers on land."
"Despite the concessions made to the Council, I still believe we have a strong defence of the environment and water supply here."
"The key points are the 'protection against deterioration' requirement on Member States, the requirement that nitrate quality standards be consistent with the Water Framework Directive and the requirement for a revision to be carried out every six years."
"Finally, I want to refer to the enhanced role of Parliament under the new comitology procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon today."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.00 p.m. and resumed at 11.30 p.m.)"
"Welcome"
"I would like to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from the Afghan Parliament led by the President of the National Assembly of Afghanistan, Mr Mohammad Yonus Qanoni."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr Mohammad Yonus Qanoni is accompanied by four other Members of the Afghan Parliament."
"Tomorrow I will have the pleasure of meeting this delegation personally. It has already held an exchange of views with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development."
"We welcome you most warmly and we would invite you to remain in the gallery for the award of the Sakharov Prize to Mr Milinkievitch and, later on, the important debate on the European Union's annual report on human rights."
"1."
"Nomination of the Bulgarian Commissioner (vote)"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"We shall begin with the proposals for decisions on the appointments of the new Commissioners nominated by Bulgaria and Romania, respectively."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, will speak on its behalf."
"President of the Commission."
"Mr President, today you are asked to give your opinion on the appointment of the two Commissioners that have been nominated by Bulgaria and Romania, Mrs Meglena Kuneva and Mr Leonard Orban."
"It is the first time that an accession treaty explicitly makes provision for consultation of the European Parliament on the appointment of Commissioners from new Member States."
"I very much welcome this important role given to your institution as it increases both the democratic rights of Parliament and the Commission's accountability."
"I stand here before you today to ask for your approval of our two new colleagues."
"I do this because I sincerely believe that they both fulfil the highest standards."
"The approval by the European Parliament of the appointment of the two Commissioners-designate will allow the Council to formally appoint them."
"Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban will thus become full Members of the Commission as of 1 January 2007."
"As Commission President I am particularly happy and proud that Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban - two remarkable personalities - will join my team."
"Both have worked incredibly hard to help their countries to successfully complete their final preparations for accession."
"With their experience and their European conviction, both will bring a valuable contribution to the collegial work of the Commission on moving Europe forward, including the institutional settlement necessary to ensure a more democratic, transparent and efficient Europe."
"In the course of the last weeks many of you had the opportunity to get to know the two Commissioners-designate, be it in a bilateral context or through the hearings."
"Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban have successfully passed in the relevant parliamentary committees."
"It is my firm belief that both candidates in the course of the hearings proved their personal integrity and independence, their general competence and professional experience, as well as their deep and genuine European commitment."
"The promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity in the European Union touches the very substance of our European values and identity and is the prerequisite for communicating Europe and multicultural dialogue."
"I am sure that Mr Orban is the right person to do this job."
"The protection of consumer rights is central to the interests of each and every one of our citizens."
"I am sure that Mrs Kuneva is the best person to do this."
"1 January 2007 will be a truly historic moment."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will complete the fifth enlargement of the European Union."
"Enlargement has not only contributed to peace, prosperity and stability throughout Europe but has also made all of us richer socially, economically, and culturally."
"With Bulgaria and Romania becoming members of the European Union, we will see the fulfilment of the ambitions and hopes of so many people who have fought for freedom in Europe for so long."
"The new Member States will now be firmly anchored in the community of European values which inform and permeate the public purpose of the European Union."
"Their rightful place at the heart of this community will give them new confidence and new dynamism which I am sure will generate benefits for the whole of our Union."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am, quite honestly, surprised at being called on to speak right now, but life is always full of surprises."
"I was very glad to hear what the President of the Commission had to say: the hearings have been held, and the result is that both Mrs Kunewa and Mr Orban have met with the approval of the relevant committees."
"It is for me an honour and a joy to be able to affirm these two Commissioners; we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will endeavour to work very well with both of them."
"We have the goodwill to do so, and we say 'yes' to the appointment of both of them."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hearing of members of the Commission is an important prerogative of this House; it is one that we take seriously, and it appears to us that the Commission does so too."
"It is for that reason that Mr Vosgenian, the first Romanian candidate, did not even get as far as a hearing that he would not have got through, and you, Mr President of the Commission, did the right thing in learning from that and taking action to get another candidate; that shows that Europe's democratic structures work when the institutions take their roles seriously."
"Far from being a formality, these hearings are a real testing process, and the Socialist Group in this House believes that both candidates, Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban, have come through it well, and that they are equal to the task allotted to them, and so we will be voting in favour of both of them being appointed."
"Even so, it still has to be said that the letter you, Mr Barroso, wrote in response to our questions, does nothing to make it any the clearer precisely what portfolio has been allocated to Mr Orban, and that shows that the search for a portfolio in a Commission consisting of 27 members can be interpreted to mean only that this Commission is being formed on the basis of the Treaty of Nice, a treaty that was, in the opinion of those who drafted it, not even suitable for 15 states, and it certainly does not work for 27 of them."
"(Applause)"
"Institutionally speaking, then, we have reached our limit."
"This criticism must neither be held back nor taken to be directed at Mrs Kuneva or Mr Orban, for it is to the discredit of neither of them."
"Now, Mr Orban, Mrs Kuneva, we knew even before the hearings that neither of you are enthusiastic supporters of the social democratic movement, but we will not hold that against you, for everyone has the right to be wrong; even so, though, we appeal to you to take care, when you become members of the college, that that college does not lose sight of the need for a political balance, in Europe, between economic and social responsibility."
"By voting for you, we are expressing our confidence that you will come to see that."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the imminence of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is underlined by today's vote on the nominees for the posts of two Commissioners and two Members of the Court of Auditors."
"Both Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban were deeply involved in the negotiations for their respective countries' membership."
"Each was dealt a tough hand of cards, especially if you think of the distance that each country has travelled on its road to membership."
"It proved tougher than expected and needed two years more than other countries emerging from the former Europe."
"We must learn now to adapt our Union to a wider membership - a fuller house - with inevitable family disputes."
"All must learn to give a bit if they are to take."
"Whether we yet have a full house, of course, is still a matter for debate and maybe Mr Brok would enlighten us towards the end of this week?"
"It is fitting that those who bore the burden of accession negotiations bear some of the fruit of their labours."
"Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban have a great deal to contribute to Europe."
"The depth of knowledge they have gleaned from the talks will stand them in good stead for their collegial decision-making on the upper floors of the Berlaymont."
"Whether they choose to play the Queen of Hearts or the Ace of Spades in President Barroso's House of Cards is up to them, but I remain convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will be an asset to the Union, and not a burden as some would have us believe."
"I know that some in this House are thinking of voting against one of the nominees for the Court of Auditors."
"If we are serious about bringing two countries into the Union, let us be serious about bringing them in properly and not play games with the nominees."
"Let me offer a word of advice to President Barroso as he chews on how to use the talents of his two latest recruits: there are not enough jobs for 27 Commissioners."
"That is why we supported the Constitution's provisions to slim the College down."
"Please ensure that Members of the Commission act in the Community interest and not as representatives of their home states; define their jobs clearly, more clearly than you have done in your letter to President Borrell, allegedly 'clarifying' the role of intercultural dialogue."
"It has left many of us with more questions than answers."
"However, we wish you success."
"We wish the two new Commissioners success and we expect that you will do the job we need to advance the cause of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will vote in favour of the integration of Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban into the Commission."
"We would like to congratulate them on their nomination and we hope that they will be able to work in a team whose internal cohesion, motivation and European vision is not, unfortunately, that which we hope for and which the European Union needs."
"In this respect, our vote of approval today is more a sign of welcome to the two new Member States, represented here by the two new Commissioners, than support for the current Commission and its policy."
"Mrs Kuneva, you will very quickly become aware that, in the Commission that you are entering today, the industrial lobbies have much easier access and much easier lives than the consumer movements."
"I hope that you will be able to introduce change and stand up to this in some way."
"Mr Orban, you will quickly become aware that protecting the cultural dimension of the European Union is a very difficult task, in a Commission which is perhaps too open to one part of our world rather than to others."
"Mr President, casting our vote of approval in this matter for us also means setting a precedent in some way, by voting on individual Commissioners; this is something that we have often called for and that we hope to be able to do in the future."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I would like, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to welcome our two new Commissioners, Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban."
"My group will approve these two nominations."
"I myself would have preferred it if the President of the Commission had made the most of the conclusion of this stage of enlargement to engage in a fundamental debate on an interim assessment of his Commission, to reshuffle the cards within the enlarged Commission, if appropriate, and, finally, to submit the whole of his team to Parliament's vote."
"At a time when so many questions are being asked about the operation, the direction and the future of the EU, this would have done the Commission's authority and parliamentary democracy no harm at all."
"As we can see, this was not what was decided."
"Even so, all the best to Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, today we mark another step in the progress of Romania and Bulgaria towards welcoming them back into the family of democratic nations within the European Union."
"I welcome the appointment of Commissioner-designate Kuneva and Commissioner-designate Orban, and I hope that all colleagues within this Chamber will not use political points to try and attack them in the important role that they will undertake in the future."
"In particular, the respect for diversity that will be required in the European Union of the 21st century is encompassed by the portfolio that Commissioner Orban will have, and I call on all colleagues to be as generous as possible towards him, and to all the Commissioners, but in particular to be helpful towards him in suggesting new ways in which that diversity can be protected within the European Union."
"Finally, at this important juncture, it is vital that all peoples across Europe come together and unite, and understand that, no matter what may divide us in our different ideologies, or in our different political opinions, or, indeed, in our different religions, the things that bring us together, the things that we share, are far more powerful and far greater, in order to effect change for the good, not only in Europe but on the world stage."
"Rather than being bogged down in mere politics, let us look to the bigger picture."
"Let us grasp the opportunities that have been given to Romania and Bulgaria today, but, most importantly of all, let us grasp the opportunities which have been given to the European Union to act as a beacon of hope, of democracy, of freedom, of respect for human rights, across the world."
"In particular, let us ensure that we can do this collectively for the betterment of all mankind."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, today we are being asked to approve the nomination of European Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania."
"Well, I do not approve."
"I voted against the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, as did many of my colleagues from the IND/DEM Group."
"My colleagues and I from the UK Independence Party were vilified in 2004 because we opposed the accession, but we did so for several reasons, not least that we are totally opposed to the European Union's empire-building because it is a thoroughly undemocratic organisation that undermines self-government."
"We also voted against it because we knew that there would be mass migration from some of the new Member States to Britain - a mass migration with which my country's infrastructure cannot cope."
"Two years later we have been shown to be right: an estimated 650 000 people came to Britain from the accession countries during the first year of membership."
"Furthermore, such has been the drain of skilled workers, that we now have the ridiculous situation in which the President of Poland is putting out statements calling for his fellow countrymen to return to their homeland."
"Will the EU empire-builders ever consider the immense social cost of their actions?"
"We now stand at the cusp of a tragedy: two further countries, which have recently thrown off the yoke of communism and grasped their freedom, are about to throw it away by taking on the yoke of Brussels, with all its suffocating bureaucracy and its relentless pursuit of power."
"It will not be many years before Bulgaria and Romania discover what a mistake they have made in subjecting themselves to the will of an intolerant European Commission."
"It will be like exchanging an iron curtain for a vast curtain of paper, which could end up being almost as big a threat to civil liberties and prosperity as was its predecessor."
"Freedom is indivisible."
"It should never be given up in the pursuit of economic gain, particularly when it has been won at such a high price."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add two quick comments to what Mr Titford has just said with regard to these Commissioners from two friendly nations - one Slavic and the other Latin - which have recently been freed, it is true, from the yoke of communism, and who we hope will not find themselves under another yoke."
"My first comment is that Mr Orban's portfolio, multilingualism, must treat the learning and use of the national languages of the Member States as a priority, including within the European institutions."
"In a little while, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our opinion on the appointment of two members of the Court of Auditors."
"I have in front of me the French versions of those reports: one of them has been drawn up by Mr Pomés Ruiz, a Spanish rapporteur, on the Bulgarian candidate; the other, by a Hungarian rapporteur, on a Romanian candidate!"
"In these French versions, the biographies of the members of the Court of Auditors and the questionnaires are in English."
"So there we have an important area for Mr Orban to work on: ensuring that linguistic diversity is respected in our institutions!"
"I would also like to wish Mrs Kuneva good luck."
"She has had a very difficult job defending the interests of her fellow Bulgarians during the negotiations: I hope that she will find it easier to defend the interests of European consumers."
"I would finally like to say that we are opposed to the application of the protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice that states that, from the point when the European Union has 27 Members, the number of Commissioners will be less than the number of Member States, which would deny some of them any representation within that institution."
"We have two and a half more years to show that that measure is entirely useless and contrary to the equality amongst nations that should govern the future of our international organisation."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the proposal for a decision on the appointment of the new Commissioner proposed by the Republic of Bulgaria, Mrs Meglena Kuneva."
"The vote will be by roll call in accordance with Rule 99(4) of the Rules of Procedure."
"(Parliament approved the decision)"
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you very much."
"Congratulations, Mrs Kuneva."
"Few Commissioners have received such long and loud applause as you."
"2."
"Nomination of the Romanian Commissioner (vote)"
"We shall continue with the vote and vote on the proposal for a decision on the appointment of the new Commissioner proposed by Romania, Mr Leonard Orban."
"(Parliament approved the decision)"
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you and congratulations to you too, Mr Orban."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments while awaiting the award ceremony for the Sakharov Prize and resumed at 12 noon)"
"Voting time"
"Formal sitting - Award of the 2006 Sakharov Prize"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, it is a great pleasure for the European Parliament to receive the winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize, Mr Milinkievitch, leader of the opposition United Democratic Forces in Belarus."
"Please believe me, Mr Milinkievitch, when I say that we are particularly happy to have you here with us today."
"(Applause)"
"There have been times when we thought that you would not be able to come."
"Our Sakharov Prize winners have often been unable to come here to receive the prize."
"Aung San Suu Kyi, Wei Jingsheng and the Women in White have regrettably been unable to attend this ceremony."
"We should remember that we Europeans, at home in our consolidated democracies, often take human rights for granted, seeing them as something natural and indisputable, like the air we breathe."
"We enjoy our political and civil freedoms, sometimes forgetting what it costs to obtain them and accustomed to exercising them."
"We become accustomed to good things very quickly, and even countries that have obtained freedom later enjoy it as if they have always had it and as if everybody had it."
"We must remember, however, that billions of people on our planet lack the freedom that we enjoy."
"Our Union is based on respect for human rights, and defending them and promoting them around the world is part of our raison d'être."
"Not just for moral reasons, but also in our own interest."
"In terms of Europe's interests, it is a priority that our freedom should be exercised by the whole of humanity."
"The Sakharov Prize is therefore an expression of the European Union's defence of and commitment to human rights, and this year it is being awarded to a person who is dedicating his life to the fight for freedom in his country."
"Everybody knows that the presidential elections in Belarus in March were neither free nor fair and that the European Union was not able to send its observers, their access to the country being denied."
"Mr Milinkievitch has had the courage to challenge the last dictatorship in Europe; he has managed to unite the democratic opposition forces in order to restore political rights and freedoms in his country."
"He has headed mass demonstrations and has been arrested for urging his fellow countrymen to defend their fundamental rights."
"Mr Milinkievitch, you have become a symbol of resistance to oppression and of hope for a democratic future."
"We share your ambition that Belarusian society should obtain the right to elect its leaders democratically, the right to independent information, the right to create non-governmental organisations and the right to an independent and impartial judiciary."
"That is something that the European Parliament has always defended."
"We have protested against the violence, the arbitrary arrests and the politically-motivated sentences by the Belarusian regime against people fighting for fundamental rights in that country."
"The Prize that you are receiving today is a demonstration of our support for all of the people fighting alongside you."
"This is not the first time that we have awarded this prize to people from Belarus."
"In 2004, this Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Belarus Association of Journalists, to professionals who were risking their lives in order to discover the truth and to make it known."
"Today, two years later, we are once again showing our full support for the fight for democracy in Belarus, because things have not improved since then."
"The death penalty is still carried out regularly in that country."
"I wish to condemn the arrest and sentencing of Aleksander Kazulin, who is currently on hunger strike in prison, and I wish to tell you that we are convinced that Belarus's future lies in sharing in the freedom and prosperity of democratic Europe."
"You are a scientist, Mr Milinkievitch, as was Andrei Sakharov himself."
"Both of you have shared the same opinions, the same values and the same education and you have experienced the same tragic consequences of confronting a totalitarian regime."
"Today, the prize bearing the name of the scientist Sakharov is being awarded to another scientist, but above all it is being awarded to the hope of a democratic Belarus and to all the people fighting alongside you to make it a reality."
"You have the floor, Mr Milinkievitch."
"(Sustained applause)"
"(The President awarded the Sakharov Prize)"
"leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall speak in my mother tongue because I would like to say what I think, and I always think in Belarusian."
"I am therefore going to speak in the language that best allows me to express my feelings."
"(Parliament stood and applauded Mr Milinkievitch.)"
"(The speaker spoke in his mother tongue, the text below being a translation)"
"I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament most warmly for awarding me this high honour, the Andrei Sakharov Prize, named after the brilliant physicist and ardent defender of human rights."
"I would also like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you."
"This prize is not for me alone!"
"It is for all the Belarusians, for all of those who were in the square in Minsk last March, who have been thrown into prison and expelled from universities and workplaces."
"This prize is for all of those who are carrying on with the fight."
"There are many of us!"
"We are the ones who want Belarus to return to the family of European democracies and who are ready to sacrifice our personal well-being, our freedom and even our lives to get there."
"Belarus has always been a European country."
"It has given a lot to Europe, making many sacrifices."
"In the 19th century, it gave Europe a prototype for a first democratic constitution, the statute of the Grand-Duchy of Lithuania."
"It gave the world several eminent personalities, such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Marc Chagall, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Dimitri Shostakovich and Tadeusz Kościuszko."
"The Belarusians were the second in Europe to translate the Bible into their mother tongue."
"During the Second World War, it was in Belarus that the most powerful resistance movement in Europe emerged, costing the lives of one out of every three inhabitants."
"Of the six million Jews exterminated in the Holocaust, one million came from Belarus."
"If anyone deserves freedom, it is us!"
"We have earned it through the whole of our history and the sacrifices we have made on its behalf."
"Every century, as a result of endless wars, Belarus lost from a quarter to a third of its sons and daughters."
"It lost its elite."
"Our people have suffered the forced uprooting of their national identity and the eradication of their historical memory."
"In 1991, we were delighted to finally achieve our independence, but at the time we did not realise that freedom and independence are not the same thing."
"Today, we are once again fighting for freedom and defending our independence."
"We are doing so not just for ourselves, but also for our children, who, like French, Lithuanian, Polish and British children, have the right to live in a free country."
"It was our children who spent long nights standing on the square in Minsk after the elections on 19 March, when the adults could not stand the cold and returned to their homes."
"It was our children who were thrown into closed lorries, suffocating, and imprisoned, while their parents spent days looking for them."
"It was our children who, having been released from prison, were expelled from universities for their choice of conscience."
"But not for one moment did they doubt the justice of our common choice."
"I am proud of them."
"Throughout the week following the elections, when we were remaining on the square and protesting against the outrageous falsification of the results of those elections, the authorities arrested more than a thousand people."
"Minsk's prisons had never been full to bursting: that was exactly what happened during that week."
"The regime realised that that protest movement could only be ended by military force."
"That is why, during those few days, the authorities arrested everybody who came to the square, even those who were simply bringing food, water and warm clothing to the people living in the 'tent city'."
"On 19 March, the authorities did not expect to see tens of thousands of people coming out, despite the threat of reprisals."
"That was our first victory."
"I am very well aware that we will need many more similar victories before we can put an end to that illegal regime."
"The former presidential candidate, Mr Aliaksandr Kazulin, is now in prison, sentenced to five and a half years."
"He has now been on hunger strike for more than 50 days."
"His state of health is extremely serious: he has lost 40 kilos, and his life is in danger."
"This prize is also for him, and for Zmitser Dachkevitch, Pavel Seviarynets, Mikola Statkevitch and Andreï Klimaǔ and all of the other political prisoners in my country."
"This prize is a sign of Europe's awareness of the situation in Belarus."
"This prize is a wonderful example of moral politics."
"This prize is a recognition of Belarus's European future."
"This high distinction today could have been received by the person who was the leader of the Belarusian democratic movement for several years, Professor Hienadź Karpienka. Or by the former Internal Affairs Minister, Yury Zakharanka."
"Or by Viktar Hantchar, the vice-president of the last legitimate parliament in Belarus."
"These people are heroes, fighters for the freedom of Belarus, but they have disappeared without trace or have been murdered. These are the methods, as old as human hate and as horrifically outmoded as the inquisition, that the Belarusian authorities currently use against their opponents."
"In his speech on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Andrei Sakharov said: 'I am convinced that international trust, mutual understanding, disarmament and international security are not possible without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, glasnost, the right to travel and the right to choose one's country of residence'."
"I share that view."
"The academic Sakharov always preached non-violent resistance."
"I agree with him in that regard too."
"We have everything we need to win: faith in Belarus's European future, solidarity, courage and experience."
"For many young people, blue - the colour of the European flag - has become a symbol."
"In March, that flag was raised alongside our white, red and white national flag."
"As a sign of those countries' solidarity with us, the flags of Lithuania, of Ukraine, of Poland, of Russia, of Estonia, of Azerbaijan and of Georgia were also flown."
"We must conquer the fear that has impregnated people's consciences over the last ten years as a result of constant propaganda."
"Andrei Sakharov issued a warning: 'Freedom of thought is the only safeguard against the contamination of people by collective myths, which, in the hands of perfidious hypocrites and demagogues, can turn into a bloody dictatorship'."
"That is what is happening today in Belarus."
"Monuments to the glory of Stalin are reappearing."
"Resurrecting the 'best' traditions of the Soviet system, the official media endlessly pours out torrents of lies and slander, as in Sakharov's era."
"The main enemy is the West and local democrats are depicted as its agents."
"The regime is in a difficult situation today."
"Its planned economy is not efficient, and Russia is threatening to put an end to economic preferences."
"For that reason, the government is getting nervous and is trying to blame its political opponents."
"At the end of November, at his meeting with Ukrainian journalists, Mr Lukachenka stated that, 'this opposition sneaks abroad to call for the application of economic sanctions against the country and is then happy that gas prices are going to rise tomorrow'."
"I would like to take this opportunity to state from this European platform, taking full responsibility and to everybody, particularly the Belarusian people, that these are lies!"
"We have never called for economic sanctions against our country and we are perfectly aware that such sanctions primarily hit the ordinary citizens of Belarus."
"The regime in power will always find ways to sustain its officials."
"We have always stated that Russian gas would no longer be cheap for Belarus, that it was going to become expensive in Russia itself."
"It is a shame that the Belarusian leaders have not taken the opportunity that had presented itself and that they have not taken advantage of the possibilities they have had for a long time to carry out real economic reforms."
"Now the Belarusian people are going to suffer the consequences."
"The main conditions that Moscow currently imposes on Mr Lukachenko in return for their long-standing economic and political support include joining the monetary union, effectively the Russian rouble, and the adoption of the constitutional act of what the Russians call the 'Union State'."
"Accepting these conditions would inevitably mean a loss of sovereignty for Belarus."
"The Belarusian political leaders are currently still resisting a move in that direction."
"Mr Lukachenka has recently openly expressed his concern about the country's independence."
"He talks about the link, which Belarusian democratic forces have been talking about for a long time, between independence and well-being."
"But in his case, defending independence must not be confused with defending his personal interests and his desire to hold on to power at all costs."
"He and his entourage are perfectly aware that, with the loss of independence and the arrival of Russian capital in the country, very few of them would keep their positions or their wealth."
"We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that, led by an instinct for self-preservation, the Belarusian regime will accept Moscow's conditions and call a referendum to approve them."
"There can be no doubt that only democracy, rather than dictatorship, can guarantee Belarus's independence."
"The fact that we have not so far found a common language with Moscow does not mean that the Belarusian democratic forces are against Russia."
"We want to live in a sovereign State and build the best possible relations with Russia."
"We are prepared to take account of its interests, provided that they do not run counter to our own interests."
"Russia is a strategic partner for us, as it is for the EU."
"A democratic Belarus will be a credible and reliable friend to Russia."
"We believe that banning entry to the countries of the European Union for people violating the Constitution and participating in repression is a very effective measure."
"This list of enemies of democracy should be extended."
"At the same time, I would appeal to you not to increase the cost of Schengen visas for Belarusian citizens."
"From 1 January 2007, the cost of a Schengen visa is expected to be EUR 60."
"For the overwhelming majority of Belarusians who desperately need free contacts with the West, that cost would be prohibitive."
"That decision is in danger of creating a new 'iron curtain'."
"These measures will benefit Mr Lukachenka, who is always telling the Belarusian people that 'nobody wants us in the West'."
"We were very pleased with the European Commission's proposals last month."
"They offer Mr Lukachenka's government a good opportunity to leave behind the international self-isolation and the poor economic situation that it is stuck in."
"Aliaksandr Lukachenka himself was obliged to acknowledge, at the meeting of the government, that next year will be 'catastrophically tough'."
"If the regime accepts these proposals, Belarus will be able to receive considerable support for the launching of the political and socio-economic reforms that have been so necessary for so long, and to begin a genuine rapprochement with Europe, including by means of gradual economic integration."
"However, there is practically no hope that the Belarusian Government will accept the course of rapprochement with the European Union."
"There have already been plenty of similar proposals, but the regime has never responded in a positive concrete fashion."
"Its faithful are perfectly aware that, once it is launched, democratisation will inevitably and very quickly put an end to their stranglehold."
"The current leader of Belarus would never win genuine free elections."
"At the same time, this European Union proposal offers us the opportunity to make the citizens of our country understand that, despite what the State propaganda says, Europe is leaving the door open to Belarus, but to a free and democratic Belarus."
"These proposals have appeared at a very appropriate time, during the local election campaign."
"There will be no genuine elections, just as there is no genuine local government in Belarus."
"Within the context of that campaign, we are distributing information on the European Union's proposals."
"We appreciate your assistance very much and we thank you most warmly for it."
"I would, however, ask you to extend it and make it more flexible."
"We are talking about things that are already well-known: assistance for free media, support for civil society and for repressed people."
"The European Union's current programmes are drawn up for countries that are already moving towards democracy and carrying out reforms, but they cannot work in the case of Belarus."
"In order to promote democracy in countries such as mine, it is high time that a European Fund for democracy were created with real resources geared towards countries with dictatorial regimes."
"Europe must not shrug its shoulders and say 'what can we do about it?'."
"There is a lot you can do!"
"You can help us to break down the barriers to information and the restricted view of the world imposed upon my fellow countrymen by government propaganda, to create a public space conducive to open debate amongst the citizens, bringing together independent authors, intellectuals and moral authorities."
"This will undoubtedly help civil society in Belarus to develop more quickly."
"Europe's recent message to the Belarusian people was both a demonstration of your solidarity and a reminder to the current regime of its responsibility for its crimes."
"The most important thing, however, is that that message should make clear that our country belongs in Europe."
"It is my profound conviction that Europe will never be complete without Belarus."
"That is why we repeat the same slogans as my ancestors who rose up against tyranny for the sake of freedom: 'For your freedom and for ours.'"
"As a Belarusian and a citizen of a European country, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart and I also thank you on behalf of all of those people who were on the square in March and those who have been, or still are, in prison for defending their fundamental right to live in a free country."
"I thank you for having faith in our victory."
"I promise you that our victory will not be long in coming."
"My country has changed."
"It is less afraid and it believes in change."
"Belarus will soon return to the European family and will once again be a free and democratic State."
"Historically, dictatorships have no future and, as history shows, they end badly for the tyrants."
"Under a dictatorship, the only real option is to fight, simply because we have no other choice."
"Thank you for your support and long live Belarus!"
"(Parliament stood and applauded the speaker)"
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"Thank you, Mr Milinkievitch."
"The European Parliament is proud to have awarded you this Prize and is sure that the words you have spoken today will go down in history."
"(Applause)"
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments while awaiting the continuation of the vote)"
"Agenda: see Minutes"
"(DE) Mr President, this morning's sitting was yet another that ended half an hour early, and Mrs Kaufmann, who was in the chair, deserves thanks for having apologised for this to the visitors who were pouring in at the time."
"I would ask that the person in the chair at any given time be given a bit more speaking time if it is in any case clear that the sitting is going to end earlier."
"It is not good for visitors to come into the Chamber in the expectation of hearing a reasonably interesting debate, and then to find the place empty."
"It would be possible to be a bit more flexible in this respect, and it would keep the Members happy too."
"(Applause)"
"I share your desire for flexibility, Mr Swoboda."
"I am very firm when time is limited."
"When possible, I would like to increase the maximum speaking time."
"Having said that, when the agenda's time, and the Members' time, has run out, what can we do?"
"Mr President, may I just say in that regard that you do not only have the option of letting speakers speak for longer, you also have the option of taking additional speakers under the 'catch the eye' procedure, which is perfectly within the Rules of Procedure."
"Of course, Mr Corbett, provided that the speakers in question are here, because a President cannot give the floor to absent Members!"
"1."
"Nomination of the Bulgarian Member of the Court of Auditors (vote)"
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to invoke the Rules of Procedure."
"I feel obliged to point out - as I said a moment ago - that the report by Mr Pomés Ruiz is not available in French, or, to be more precise, the version of this report presented as the French version contains the biography of the candidate as well as a reply to questions exclusively in English, which seems to me to violate our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Gollnisch, since you are a stickler for the rules, I am going to do you the favour of giving you the only reliable information: you are absolutely right, we should have full translations of all texts put to the vote."
"And that is actually the case."
"All of the texts put to the vote are available in all languages."
"Annexed documents themselves are not in any way put to the vote, according to our Rules of Procedure, and are not therefore subject to translation in their entirety."
"Now you are fully informed!"

"Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to say briefly that I hope that we are on the point of adopting, by a large majority, this European instrument for promoting democracy and human rights, because it is the only instrument enabling us to support projects for promoting democracy in third countries, without the support of the governments, and it is therefore the only instrument that can provide a response to the issues that have just been raised by Mr Milinkievitch."
"How can we support free media, how can we support independent civil society, how can we defend and protect the defenders of human rights in third countries, without the support of governments?"
"The answer is by means of this instrument."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should just like to inform the House that not only have we achieved a separate instrument to promote democracy and human rights as a successor to the European initiative, against the original wishes of the Council and Commission, but we have managed to achieve all the objectives set by the European Parliament."
"In reply to Mr Milinkevich this morning, it is true now that that instrument can have the capacity to operate within his country, without his country's consent as Mrs Flautre says."
"Moreover, this year I visited a number of what we call 'difficult countries' - China, Cuba, even Russia today, parts of the Arab world - where the democracy backlash is moving in."
"I should like to read from the letter that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner sent last Friday to the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok: 'This provision may also include working with democratic political partners in third countries, provided that the principle of impartiality towards such partners is respected."
"On the other hand, funding of political parties as such remains excluded from the scope of the draft regulation.'"
"So, Mr President, this is part of the process of the moral politics that Mr Milinkevich talked about, but it is only part of it."
"We must do a lot more and not leave that field to the Americans."
"(Applause)"
"If I am not mistaken, you are proposing an oral amendment to Amendment 147."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, you are indeed not mistaken."
"This is an oral amendment to Amendment 147 which, in order to conform precisely to the terms negotiated with the Council, is intended to replace the phrase"
"'including rights of migrants, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons' with 'including migrants' enjoyment of human rights, rights of asylum seekers and internally displaced persons'."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"19."
"Prevention of injury and the promotion of safety (vote)"

"A financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (vote)"
"That concludes voting time."
"Voting time (continued)"
"We shall now resume voting time."
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. I voted in favour of the appointment of Mrs Meglena Kuneva, the Bulgarian Commissioner designate."
"However, while I have no problem with the individual herself or with the appointment of a Bulgarian Commissioner, I have serious doubts about there being enough jobs for 27 commissioners."
"I look forward to a Treaty change that significantly reduces the number of Commissioners."
"in writing. Mr President, my party is keen on the continuing enlargement of the Union, and we look forward to our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues joining us."
"We have paid close attention to the confirmation process of our two new Commissioners, and are satisfied that both are welcome additions to the College."
"I am pleased to support Mrs Kuneva's appointment today."
"in writing. I voted in favour of the appointment of Mr Leonard Orban as Romanian Commissioner."
"However, I very much regret that the Nice Treaty makes it necessary for us to have one Commissioner per Member State."
"I simply do not believe that there are enough serious jobs for 27 Commissioners and look forward to a Treaty reform along the lines of the draft Constitution that significantly reduces the number of Commissioners."
"in writing. Mr President, my party is keen on the continuing enlargement of the Union, and we look forward to our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues joining us."
"We have paid close attention to the confirmation process of our two new Commissioners, and are satisfied that both are welcome additions to the College."
"I am pleased to support Mr Orban's appointment today."
"in writing. I welcome the appointment of a Bulgarian Member of the Court of Auditors and am glad that this proved uncontroversial in the light of other difficulties."
"in writing. I voted in favour of Mr Ispir despite allegations of corruption involving Mr Ispir being made in the Romanian media."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control could find no evidence to support these allegations in their hearing."
"Mr Ispir has also strongly denied any wrongdoing."
"On the evidence available the allegations against him appear to be politically motivated."
"However, if any evidence of wrongdoing emerges I would expect Mr Ispir to resign from the Court."
"(DE) Mr President, if a stop is to be put to meat scandals and the back-door introduction of genetic engineering, then consumers need to be told the blunt facts, with nothing left out, but it cannot be acceptable that the stringent food regulations we impose on our own farmers and producers should be regularly circumvented by imports from third countries, a state of affairs that I regard as unfair to our farmers, counterproductive in terms of consumer protection and therefore needing to be done away with at once."
"It is for that reason that I voted against the Thyssen report."
"in writing. (SV) The June List thinks it crucial for there to be proper consumer protection within the EU."
"However, funding the necessary measures is primarily a national issue."
"We do not, then, believe that there is any justification for the budget heading of EUR 156.8 million entailed by the present consumer policy programme."
"We are also extremely critical of the proposal to support financially the development of master's degree courses in consumer issues within the framework of an integrated European examination."
"It is not, of course, for the EU institutions either to determine the type of educational courses to be established in the Member States or to finance these."
"We should, then, have voted against this report."
"in writing. Irish consumers know only too well the reality that is Rip-Off Ireland."
"Spiralling costs of basic services such as gas and electricity, or outrageous mobile phone and roaming charges continue to hit Irish consumers hard."
"Of course those living in or at risk from poverty are hardest hit."
"In order to counter this unacceptable situation, government needs to step in with stronger regulation and resourcing of the relevant consumer protection agencies."
"In this context I welcome today's report by Marianne Thyssen MEP."
"The aim of the report is to initiate an action programme in the field of consumer protection for the years 2007 to 2013."
"The programme seeks to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States and to contribute to protecting the health, safety, economic and legal interests of consumers."
"The programme would also attempt to promote consumer rights to information, to education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests."
"In Sinn Fein's view the Irish Government need to take a lead in strengthening the rights and protections of consumers."
"However, there is clearly a role for the EU, to assist Member States' agencies in sharing models of best practice and ensuring a level of consistency throughout the European Union."
"in writing. - (FR) The Community action programme in the field of consumer protection for 2007-2013 is intended to complement, support and monitor the policies of the Member States."
"It will contribute to protecting the health, the safety and the economic and legal interests of consumers, and also to promoting their right to information, education and organisation with a view to defending their interests."
"The actions will contribute to guaranteeing all of the Union's consumers a high level of protection and to ensuring the effective application of the consumer protection rules."
"I am delighted that this programme has been divided into two parts, thereby distinguishing between health and consumer protection."
"While I regret that the Commission has reduced the financial envelope from EUR 233.46 million - at first reading - to EUR 156.8 million and that the number of actions in the field of consumer protection has been reviewed and reduced from 20 to 11, I have voted in favour of Mrs Thyssen's report, so that consumers' organisations can benefit from this programme in the interests of our fellow European citizens."
"This regulation details how to address and combat diseases such as BSE and scrapie, which affect ruminants as a whole."
"Firstly, the number of categories of risk of contracting BSE is reduced from five to three, in line with World Organisation for Animal Health recommendations."
"The regulation bans the use of animal proteins in feeding ruminants, but states the quantity up to which the addition of such proteins is considered insignificant."
"The report also calls for a review of the rules on the use of mechanically processed meat for human consumption and lays down new rules on providing better information to consumers."
"In order to prevent mass, indiscriminate slaughter and the ensuing losses for the producer, the report also defines the use of animals up to the end of their productive lives."
"This will naturally be monitored very closely given that there is no scientific data confirming that BSE is transmitted via milk or from cattle to their offspring."
"Prevention programmes for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are to be carried out on a voluntary basis, and there is to be regular assessment of the scientific results of these programmes."
"The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs thus support the Roth-Berendt report."
"This proposal, submitted for a second reading, differs from the legislation in force in three key areas."
"One purpose of the proposal is that data be submitted annually rather than monthly."
"According to recent studies, monthly data forwarded up to six months after the event are of limited use in day-to-day market management, whereas the compilation of annual data can be useful for medium- to long-term market studies and can help reduce the workload for the national authorities in forwarding data."
"According to the proposal, data submissions are to be required by the flag (or nationality) of the vessels responsible for the landings."
"This requirement, as opposed to the current submissions by broad groups of EU, EFTA and other vessels will enable the data to be analysed in greater detail and yet will not significantly increase the workload of the national authorities which already collect the data to this level of detail."
"Lastly, this proposal for a regulation provides for a more flexible approach, enabling sampling techniques to be used to estimate total landings."
"National authorities may, to an appropriate extent, use sampling methods for data collection purposes, providing that they justify their use and analyse the quality of the resulting data in a methodological report ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The new information and communication technologies have raised pertinent questions regarding the protection of minors and human dignity, given the amount of illicit, harmful and undesirable content that can easily be found on the Internet."
"There appears to be a desire for regulation on this issue that has come up against technical and legal difficulties."
"Measures to protect minors and human dignity are undoubtedly needed."
"It is therefore necessary to discover more about, and to assess, these new technologies and not to downplay the progress that they have brought to our societies, the consequences of which have, in the main, been beneficial to the quality of life of the poorer as well as the wealthier sections of society."
"Universal access to information gives the poorest people quicker access to solutions to day-to-day problems."
"Accordingly, as regards protecting minors, the recommendations proposed here are eminently sensible criteria that we must disseminate in our societies by raising awareness among parents and teachers and by ensuring that regulatory bodies exchange experiences in classifying audiovisual content."
"From a very early age, children are consumers and quickly take to these technologies."
"in writing. I welcome this report which aims at the implementation of automated customs systems and of coordinated processes and services under both the current and future modernised Customs Code."
"The main objective of this Decision is to determine what action needs to be taken for the achievement of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade."
"This is highly laudable but I hope it does not prove to be a pious goal."
"in writing. (SV) The June List is in favour of cross-border police cooperation."
"It is necessary to confront contemporary international crime, but this has been done successfully for decades by the international police body, Interpol."
"The June List is very sceptical about measures to combat crime being taken at supranational level."
"We are in favour of intergovernmental cooperation and opposed to common legislation."
"The Commission recommends that Asset Recovery Offices be set up in the Member States, directly subject to EC legislation and administration."
"This means further interference in the Member States' national legal systems and a weakening of Interpol's respected position."
"The June List is therefore voting against the report as a whole."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that cross-border animal diseases are an important area for cooperation within the EU, but it is not for the EU routinely to finance the fight against animal diseases."
"We want to point out that, in the final analysis, it is the responsibility of the Member States, both financially and in terms of the measures taken, to combat animal diseases and zoonoses within their respective territories."
"We therefore object, in particular, to Amendment 6, tabled by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whereby each Member State would be able, depending on its specific circumstances, to submit national programmes to be financed by the EU."
"We are voting against the report as a whole, since it is based on the European Union taking major financial responsibility for combating animal diseases."
"EU funds are not a horn of plenty that can constantly finance measures within the agricultural sphere."
"Sweden, for example, has conducted a long and successful fight against salmonella within its own borders and is proof that the Member States themselves can engage in such battles without the need for funding by the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, nature has a long memory, and so, for example, thanks to the EU's 'Groundwater 2010' programme in Austria, pollution of the groundwater from the past twentieth century is being laboriously cleared up."
"The amount of nitrates finding their way into it from agriculture creates major problems in some regions in that it makes the maintenance of the prescribed chemical conditions difficult."
"This underlines once more the importance of biologically and ecologically reasonable modes of management, which, when properly applied, can make a vital contribution, and so I do believe that it is important that much more be done to promote their use, and have voted, accordingly, in favour of the Klaß report."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the compromise, even though I also take the view that it would have been desirable, in view of groundwater's extreme importance as a primary source of food, to have a single set of European rules applicable to all hazardous substances."
"Let us also bear in mind that our health and that of our children are at stake here."
"Since short-term economies will prove to be problematic not only for the state but also for the healthcare systems, I call on all the Member States to put everything rigorously into effect, while at the same time joining in working on a further package of measures with ambitious limit values."
"in writing. Groundwater is a valuable natural asset and must be protected wherever possible."
"It also extremely awkward to treat for pollution, even when the source of pollutants has been removed."
"I broadly support the intentions of the new directive, which would help preserve Scotland's reputation of having a clean, unspoiled environment."
"There must be a balance, however, so that any new directive that is passed is not unnecessarily obstructive to farmers and agricultural business."
"For example, in 2003, Scottish farmers faced groundwater charges when those in England did not."
"As long as this proposal does not produce extra bureaucracy or impractical demands for those who work around groundwater, then I think this directive is a worthy one."
"in writing. I voted in favour of the Klaß report on the protection of groundwater against pollution."
"I believe the report is now much stronger than the Commission's original proposal."
"We will now have more stringent rules to prevent or restrict inputs of hazardous substances into groundwater with a possibility to have even more stringent national measures."
"As regards nitrates, the provisions are now consistent with the Water Framework Directive."
"in writing. Because the south-east of England has suffered so much from drought orders which have affected water usage by consumers, this directive is extremely important."
"Some 70% of south eastern England's water comes from groundwater resources."
"Protection of this resource, therefore, is essential to allow for both the capacity of such resources to recover as well as for nitrates and other chemicals to be excluded as far as possible from reaching the UK's drinking water."
"Parliament has stuck steadfastly to its view that Member State governments must do far more to prevent this type of pollution, such as arsenic, biocides and cyanide."
"Parliament's approach to 'toughen up' the legislation in this field is very much welcomed."
"Water is the basis of all life, and in this sense, a matter of life and death."
"The European Environmental Agency regards the situation as serious: 87% of groundwater in agricultural areas fails to meet EU standards on the presence of nitrates, and most of the Member States have reported on the risk of contamination by pesticides."
"A strict new Groundwater Directive is therefore of vital importance."
"The text approved by the conciliation committee deserves our support."
"This House has managed to make the notion of 'protection against quantitative decline' legally binding."
"Moreover, steps have been taken to ensure that the measures for achieving the quality standard for nitrates draw on the Water Framework Directive."
"More emphatic demands are also made of Member States and regions to prevent and reduce the introduction of dangerous substances into groundwater."
"They are now required to 'take' all the measures necessary, and not just to 'strive towards' them."
"The result at first reading was, from an environmental point of view, a huge disappointment, and the Council's common position was also a complete disaster."
"These have now been put right at second reading in this House and the subsequent conciliation procedure."
"As we should be pleased with the outcome, I have endorsed the agreement reached."
"Mr President, in all the continuing debates surrounding abortions performed on those who could live, one rather individual moment is presented by a seemingly neutral formula: reproductive healthcare, which is a catch-all term, and in a sense a confusing one."
"Therefore, we should speak openly about non-reproductive health and show concern about how to limit or lessen reproductivity inside European society without causing physical harm to women."
"Such harm is a very bad thing, but the time should come to realise that the problem is broader, as the harm includes psychological and social aspects and should deal also with the lack of compassion and growth of cruelty in our societies, which are turning them demographically into suicidal ones."
"Those are the reasons why I voted for the deletions proposed by Mr Mitchell."
"The original proposal for a regulation, tabled by the Commission and establishing a financial instrument for development cooperation was unacceptable to Parliament, given that it jeopardised its codecision powers and the very principles of development policy."
"Following the amendments introduced by Parliament, however, I support the final text of the regulation, which provides for time-limited legislation (2013) and a mid-term review (2009), the creation of a specific instrument for development policy - the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) - as distinct from the policy of cooperation with industrialised countries, a single legal basis and the drafting of more detailed financial provisions."
"It also safeguards Parliament's right to define development policy under the codecision procedure."
"in writing. The Development Cooperation Instrument covers over EUR 16 billion of development spending over the next financial perspective."
"The Instrument is in two main parts - geographic and thematic."
"Geographic spending covers the money that will be negotiated between the Commission and partner countries through Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) - almost EUR 11 billion."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament insisted in negotiations that social services, and particularly health and education, be prioritised by the Commission when drawing up CSPs."
"Parliament also got a commitment from the Commission that 20 % of spending on geographic programmes would be on basic health and basic and secondary education - an important and longstanding priority of the Socialist Group."
"Promoting development is, mutatis mutandis, equally as important in the EU's external policy as promoting human rights and democracy."
"Whenever the EU boosts the growth and development of third countries within the framework of external cooperation, it is to promote a better world and, indeed, to promote its own interests, a fact that must be acknowledged but that does not in any way diminish the virtues of the gesture."
"Quite the opposite, in fact."
"In the area of illegal immigration, for example, it should be stressed that this policy is one of the most powerful weapons at our disposal, especially when used in conjunction with our neighbours."
"As regards development, it is, like democracy and human rights, a universal good."
"in writing. Our part of the world having the privilege to live in wealth has a great responsibility to those who suffer hunger and whose future is uncertain."
"I believe we can speak with one voice according to our humanitarian responsibility."
"United in this noble cause we can change a lot."
"That is why I am against paragraphs introducing so-called 'reproductive and sexual rights' which are simply trying to win our support for abortion."
"This subject was not in the original Commission proposal."
"It appeared in Parliament."
"It is very unfortunate message for those Europeans who do not agree with abortion and do not want to pay for such practices, hidden in this document under the technical term 'reproductive right'."
"Do we really want this message to be sent?"
"We cannot disrespect Catholics' beliefs only because they are in minority today."
"Our message to them is clear: it says that Europe is not their responsibility any more!"
"In conclusion it weakens our fight against poverty and weakens European integration."
"Therefore I called for support for Amendments 1, 2 and 3."
"I could not vote in favour of this report without them."
"The Group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted against the report regarding the Commission's proposal for a regulation on a 'Modernised Customs Code', because it clears the path for invasion of major monopoly enterprises (especially logistics) in the sector of customs procedures."
"Establishing a 'certified financial body' in combination with the replacement of Article 5 of Regulation 2193/92, which refers to customs representatives, will result in the loss of jobs for all customs brokers in Greece and several EU Member States, who will be replaced with monopoly enterprises at the expense of the security of customs procedures."
"The new Customs Code follows the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to increase the prosperity of the capitalists."
"This policy, apart from destroying labour, salary, insurance and social rights of the workers, which are its primary goal, will have devastating consequences on the self-employed and the small to medium-sized enterprises."
"This reactionary policy by the EU is aimed against all grassroots classes."
"Therefore, it is absolutely essential to form an alliance between the small- to medium-sized enterprises and the working class, a people's alliance that will put an end to the aspirations of the monopolies and imperialism and will claim its own power and open the road to social prosperity."
"in writing. - (EL) It is the farmer's and consumer's right and obligation to look after their health and safety and know the composition of each product, including animal feed."
"Therefore, we agree on the amendments and amendment proposal regarding the directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs."
"However, certain companies appealed to the European Court with the pretence that the 'financial interests of the manufacturers would be seriously harmed' and that intellectual property would not be safeguarded, in order to circumvent from their obligation to inform the consumers on the composition of feedingstuffs, something that would provide farmers and consumers with the right to choose but also protect their health."
"At the same time each manufacturer would be controlled as to whether the product he is selling corresponds to the ingredients printed on the label and regulations on the protection of public health."
"However, we should not be fooled by thoughts that legal and other barriers can prevent monopoly enterprises in the animal feed sector from acting unscrupulously, given that such companies are responsible for the dioxin and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy scandals."
"For these enterprises profit is the number one priority and not the protection of public health."
"Moreover, for as long as there is a lack of adequate state control bodies and control responsibility is handed over to private individuals, we should be very worried about the protection of public health and the safety of the food chain."
"in writing. I supported this report so as to allow for a swift correction of Directive 2002/2/EC by deleting the obligation for feed manufacturers to inform customers on request of the exact composition of compound feedingstuffs, in line with the ruling of the Court of Justice."
"The ECJ ruled that this provision provided too little in the way of additional health protection to justify the serious impact on the interests of the manufacturers."
"However, I am concerned and disappointed that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation."
"The intention was to amend the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight."
"Disclosing exact percentages for animal feedingstuffs goes beyond the equivalent provisions applicable to food for human consumption."
"In most cases, ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect the interests of farmers and consumers and the formulations of the manufacturers."
"I expect the Commission to take on board these concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year."
"in writing. Conservative MEPs supported this report so as to facilitate a swift correction of Directive 2002/2/EC by deleting, in line with the Court of Justice's ruling, the obligation for feed manufacturers to inform customers on request of the exact composition of compound feedingstuffs."
"The ECJ ruled that this provision provided too little in the way of additional health protection to justify the serious impact on the interests of the manufacturers."
"However, we express our disappointment that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation."
"Our intention was to amend as well the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight."
"We do not believe that exact percentages need to be disclosed and note that this goes beyond the provisions applicable to food for human consumption."
"In most cases, ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect both the interests of farmers and the trade secrets of the manufacturers."
"We expect the Commission to take on board our concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year."
"I support the report by Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre on the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, because democracy is a fundamental universal right, and, as such, should be promoted by transnational institutions."
"The radicals in this Parliament have fought for years for the 'democratic clauses' contained in many agreements between the EU and authoritarian countries such as Laos, Vietnam and Uzbekistan to be respected."
"These agreements must be applied to the letter; however, the promotion of the right to democracy cannot be a mere by-product of policies on cooperation, international trade or humanitarian aid."
"We need to take action, devising a genuine European policy on democracy in the world, because the right to democracy cannot stop at Europe's 'neighbours'."
"All over the world we need to succeed in building an alliance between Europe and pro-democracy forces: that is what the rapporteurs aimed for."
"The EU's ability to act in the future will tell us whether this aim has been achieved, or whether new, more flexible and effective instruments will be needed."
"Socialists can look back on a long tradition of international solidarity."
"They champion human rights, peace, democracy, social security, fair sharing, public services and a clean environment not only for the sake of people in their own towns, regions or countries, but also for the people in neighbouring countries and in other parts of the world."
"Human rights for others are more important than the economic benefits accruing to us from cheap imports from countries where human rights are trampled underfoot."
"It is this conviction that has led us to back boycott campaigns against dictatorial minority regimes in South Africa, the former Rhodesia, the former Portuguese colonies and Pinochet's Chile."
"By joining forces with opposition movements in those countries, we have managed to help bring about major changes."
"This is why we, representatives of the Dutch Socialist Party, support the Flautre/McMillan-Scott report on human rights in international treaties and relations with dictatorial states."
"We are aware that this report can be misused for measures against Venezuela or other states where the people have opted for radical steps towards human equality, and maybe even as justification for military interventions on allegedly humanitarian grounds."
"We regret that fear of this appears now to have prompted some of our Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to opt for a principle of non-intervention, and hence, albeit unintentionally, for turning a blind eye to unacceptable dictatorships."
"The fact that the EU explicitly links its external policy with promoting human rights and democracy should be highlighted and lauded."
"Yet not everyone in Parliament, and in other Community institutions, will share the same views on which human rights have been violated and on where there is and is not democracy."
"Perhaps it would be better to avoid this question at this time, although in so doing we would be sweeping the situation under the carpet rather than addressing it."
"That being said, the first of these points should be brought to the fore. The expansion of democracy and the protection of human rights is intrinsically a good thing that brings benefits to the people of countries in which there is neither democracy nor respect for human rights, as well as to the people of neighbouring countries (which is why promoting these values in our neighbourhood is so important) and of the world as a whole."
"For these reasons, albeit with the reservations to which I have referred, I support the report before us."
"in writing. - (EL) The 'financial Instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide' is a blatant admission that in the name of 'democracy and human rights' we are establishing the EU's right to imperialistic interventions at the expense of nations around the world."
"The Commission report moves in an even more unacceptable, reactive direction, by stating that it will be used 'without the consent of the host country's government', in order to provide plenty of money to the long arm of EU imperialistic policy, to various non-governmental organisations and moreover to organisations that are not officially registered in their country, that is illegal organisations."
"It provides for the creation of a productive workforce for independent civil society organisations, namely training of secret agents."
"Its objectives include the strengthening of the International Criminal Court, and moreover special international criminal courts."
"The EU proclaims itself the universal protector of democracy and human rights, in the sense of a 'Trojan horse' that will be used to undermine the national and social sovereignty of nations that oppose the EU's decisions and overturn governments that do not agree with them."
"Let the nations draw their own conclusions."
"They should strengthen their struggles against this barbaric imperialistic union of monopolistic capitalists and send into history's trashcan the imperialists' ambition to be elevated to the position of worldwide policemen."
"The high number of injuries arising from accidents or violence in the Member States remains cause for concern."
"We therefore welcome the focus on the causes of these injuries, on the circumstances in which they occur and on why, when and where they occur."
"There are numerous factors behind the injuries, including social, economic and cultural factors. The more we understand these aspects, the bigger and, more importantly, the better, will be the measures put in place to prevent them from happening."
"Hence the report adopted today to place the emphasis on prevention."
"The first step is therefore to gather information."
"The bottom line, however, is that people's living conditions must be improved, which entails, for example, maintaining a public health policy with guaranteed access for all to healthcare regardless of economic circumstances, ensuring high quality public education and reducing or eliminating inequality."
"Accident and injury comes at a very heavy human price - premature death, years living with incapacity - and entails high costs in terms of healthcare and loss to society owing to lack of productivity. Injuries can be avoided, however."
"It is therefore essential to adopt healthier lifestyles and to adopt public policies that help make living conditions safer."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"in writing. - (EL) The primary reasoning of the 'effort to prevent injuries' is to invest in sectors that will offer something back."
"They promote cost-gain reasons instead of health."
"We disagree with these free market motives that drive this so-called effort to prevent injuries."
"Dissimilar incidents are being lumped together and addressed within the framework of individual responsibility on the grounds that they all classify as injuries."
"The true causes of accidents are being concealed, thereby sending the strategy for preventing and addressing them off the rails."
"Personal responsibility is stated as the main cause of these 'injuries' in order to cover up managerial liability for accidents at work."
"The promotion of 'safe behaviour' conceals the need for a prevention strategy directed at taking collective measures that safeguard safety in areas where employees work and live."
"They are aiming at burdening the employee, directly or indirectly, with the managerial obligation and cost of preventing accidents at work."
"Their end objective is to promote further intensification of work and reduction of labour cost."
"The State is largely to blame."
"In order to serve free economy, it does not carry out essential controls; it accepts criminal omissions and imperfections in projects from businessmen, which in turn increases the risk of accidents."
"Accident prevention should be enforced by the state on a regular basis, providing detail on the actual causes; moreover the bodies recording and investigating these accidents should be state controlled."
"Insurance coverage of occupational hazard, the creation of a state body of workforce doctors and safety technicians will provide the foundation for a systematic prevention of accidents at work."
"(DE) We owe it to our environment and to the people whom we represent to halt at once the policy of promoting long-distance transport the length and breadth of Europe; now that cancer and respiratory diseases have become the fourth most frequent causes of death in the EU, it is past high time that we did so."
"If, though, safety is to be promoted, a solution also needs to be sought to the problem of deluded multiculturalism, which ultimately results in more and more problem areas in European cities, in which the forces of law and order are regarded as invaders, in which a massive decline in values prevails and in which the rule of the state is no longer acknowledged."
"This phenomenon is not limited to Paris, for, in Berlin too, there are districts in which fires cannot be put out in good time or the injured taken away because it is impossible to communicate with the rampaging foreign mob, by which those trying to help risk being attacked or robbed - so-called 'no-go areas', in which even the police now venture only en masse."
"That is exactly how it started in France, and we all know what that led to."
"If we are going to talk in terms of prevention and of more security, then these problems too must be addressed before the situation escalates."
"in writing. I naturally voted in favour of my report on the financing instrument for cooperation with the industrialised countries and territories."
"As I said in the debate, this might in financial terms be the least significant of the new external instruments, but it will still involve a budget of around EUR 22 million a year and cover our external actions with 17 important countries."
"I believe the amendments that Parliament has approved will make the instrument more appropriate and effective in promoting the interests and values of the EU in these 17 heterogeneous countries."
"I would like to thank colleagues of all Groups for their support in finding such a wide consensus."

"Coordination of certain of the Member States' provisions on television broadcasting (debate)"
"Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would thank all those in this House who have worked on the proposal for a directive on the various audiovisual media services."
"I should like, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, as well as the co-rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs who have put a lot of time and energy into drawing up Parliament's opinion."
"Their efforts have been rewarded, as a number of the amendments that we are examining today improve the Commission's initial proposal, presented on 13 December 2005."
"I also wish to emphasise the excellent cooperation between Parliament, my services and the Council, whose Finnish Presidency has done a first-class job."
"The proposal for a directive on audiovisual media, which updates the TV Without Frontiers Directive, will be seen as one of the important pieces of legislation adopted in the course of this Parliamentary term."
"It responds to two requirements: firstly, it enables us to adapt our audiovisual enterprises to the considerable technological and commercial developments that have taken place; and, secondly, it demonstrates the political will that exists to ensure the continuation of the values essential to our communal life and to the forming of public opinion."
"On the one hand, the technical and commercial aspects have to be taken into consideration."
"There are the new means of watching television, such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and video on demand (VOD), the shift to digital technologies offering many more services and the arrival of new players in the market, including telecommunications companies, Internet access providers and big international investors."
"On the other hand, account needs to be taken of cherished considerations such as consumer protection, human dignity, the protection of minors and the promotion of cultural diversity and of media pluralism."
"What is more, the Commission proposal will enable all companies that want to invest in the audiovisual media to do so under fair conditions of competition and at European level, namely that of the internal market."
"The principle on which the 1989 directive is based has not been substantially changed and is still that underpinning the updated directive."
"According to this principle, full compliance with the free movement of services in the internal market is conditional on responding only to the legislation of the country of establishment."
"I would thank Parliament for supporting me in the matter of this basic demand, which contributes not only to the strength of our audiovisual industry but also, by opening national markets to European competition, to media pluralism."
"The essential points of the Commission proposal are as follows."
"Firstly, the directive should be made applicable to audiovisual media services, with a definition of these services that is sufficiently flexible to stand the test of time while remaining sufficiently precise to provide the sector with the legal certainty it needs."
"Secondly, the various services should be divided, or grouped, into two categories reflecting the twofold differentiation criterion of, on the one hand, users' choice and control, and, on the other, the impact of these services on the way in which public opinion is formed."
"Linear services, which constitute the first group, correspond to television broadcasting involving a chronological sequence of programmes."
"Such services are 'push' content, whether the platform is traditional, IPTV or mobile television."
"The other group - non-linear services - are supplied at the consumer's request."
"These services - video on demand, for example - are 'pull' content, selected from a catalogue."
"Where the rules are concerned, audiovisual content in the first category - that is to say, traditional radio and television broadcasting - needs to be subjected to a set of rules comparable to the current rules, but updated and simplified in order to take account of the developments I have mentioned."
"In the case, moreover, of audiovisual content in the second category, recourse to the country of origin principle should be authorised, on condition that the harmonised basic rules relating, in particular, to the protection of minors and the ban on incitement to racial hatred are complied with."
"We then need to lower the barriers to entering the audiovisual sector by simplifying the current rules, particularly in the area of commercial communications, and to do so without compromising the general interest."
"Madam President, I am very aware of the fact that many Members are very sensitive about this subject and that a number of them are asking for stricter rules on advertising."
"I want to be very clear about this issue."
"Like yourselves, I do not want to see American-style television, that is to say programmes constantly interrupted by isolated advertising spots."
"That is why the Commission is reaffirming the limit of a maximum of 12 minutes per hour and maintaining the principle of exception for isolated advertising spots, except in the case of sport."
"At the same time, we must bear in mind that, to put it bluntly, television channels, whether they be publicly or privately owned, need advertising revenue in order to buy high-quality content such as sport, films and documentaries."
"If we want Europeans still to be able to have a choice between free-to-air-television and pay TV, we must accept that there is going to be advertising."
"What is more, recourse to co-regulation and self-regulation needs to be encouraged as a supplementary means of implementing the directive."
"This is the first time that this option has been introduced into a legislative text."
"There is also cause for reaffirming the general interest when it comes to the protection of children against harmful content, the protection of human dignity and the consumer's right to transparency, as well as the promotion of European works, which are an expression of our cultural diversity."
"Honourable Members, you have today the opportunity, while still making stringent ethical demands, to enable the very successful European audiovisual content industry to become still more competitive and more integrated into the European internal market."
"I would ask you, in the course of the debate and the voting, to seize the opportunity to send two messages: one to Europeans, encouraging them to embrace new developments in television, and another to the professional sector, encouraging it to invest not only in order to create value but also in order that tomorrow's creative content might be European."
"It will only be possible to achieve this if the legal framework is better adapted to 21st century television."
