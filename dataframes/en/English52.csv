"Positive signs of economic progress are emerging, both in Europe and internationally."

"We must increase our efforts to implement at individual Member State level those reforms and legislative changes already agreed, if we are to reap the full social and economic benefits."

"I have written to you, Mr President, and to my colleagues in the European Council, setting out my proposed approach and the key elements of the Lisbon Agenda, on which I intend to focus at the Spring European Council."
"Our primary focus is clear: sustainable growth and high-quality employment are our twin priorities."
"It is my intention that, during the Spring European Council, we will have a real debate on the most pressing economic and social challenges facing Europe."
"Investment in physical and human capital, supporting higher rates of growth across the European Union economy and, equally, continuing to maintain macroeconomic stability are just some of the challenges."
"A central challenge facing Europe continues to be competitiveness."
"While the internal market has indeed been one of the Union’s most important achievements, we see the further development of the services sector as the key motor of growth and job creation."
"Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Europe, however, is the pressing need to create more and better employment."
"We welcome the focus and the practical, country-specific messages in the report of the Employment Taskforce which was chaired by Mr Wim Kok."

"Social dialogue will greatly assist us in addressing these challenges."
"During our presidency, I look forward to working with the European social partners, through the Tripartite Social Summit in March and in other ways, to boost their involvement in achieving the overall Lisbon goal."
"Before leaving the Lisbon Agenda, I also want to point out that 2005 will offer a unique opportunity for a mid-point review of the overall process."
"How to stay on course to realise the Lisbon goal in the new climate represents a very considerable challenge."
"The Irish presidency will contribute to the process of setting up a meaningful evaluation of the Agenda, in cooperation with our partners, including the incoming presidency."
"Over the past 50 years, we in Europe have created an area of peace and prosperity."
"We have also created a single market where our people can trade and do business without barriers."
"We must ensure that the freedoms we enjoy are not exploited by criminal elements for illegal gains."
"As a presidency, Ireland will work for the greatest levels of freedom, security and safety for all the people of the European Union."

"This will involve a wide-ranging agenda including asylum, immigration, police, judicial cooperation in criminal matters and civil law cooperation."
"The June European Council is likely to initiate an assessment of the achievements of the Tampere programme, with a view to launching a further development of the Union’s justice and home affairs policies."
"We will also focus on practical police cooperation."
"We will place emphasis on the fight against drugs and organised crime and on combating illegal immigration."

"I welcome Parliament's decision to award the Sakharov Prize to the Secretary-General of the UN."

"We will also work to advance EU-UN cooperation in crisis management."

"The United States has stressed the importance it attaches to working with key partners, including Europe."
"We will continue to focus EU-US relations on what we can and should achieve together."
"Our aim will be to consult and cooperate with the United States on the broad range of issues, both political and economic, that face us all."
"We intend to work particularly closely with the United States on areas such as the Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan and effective multilateralism, as well as on the extensive trade and economic agenda."
"We will not always see eye to eye, but we can and should concentrate on those areas where our cooperation is to the mutual benefit of our citizens and the wider international community."
"The European Union values its relationship with the Americas as a whole. This is reflected in the fact that the European Union will have summit meetings with the US, with Canada, with Latin American and Caribbean countries during our presidency."
"These meetings will provide key opportunities to strengthen our relationships."
"In the Middle East, we will continue to promote the implementation of the roadmap as the basis for progress towards a just and lasting two-state solution."

"Enlargement gives renewed impetus to the Union’s strategic relationship with Russia."
"Our security and well-being are increasingly intertwined and we need to work effectively together."
"The EU-Russia Summit during our presidency is an opportunity to set a course for our future relationship."
"In the conflict prevention area, we want to focus, in particular, on the role of non-governmental organisations and civil society in conflict prevention."
"We also want to integrate support for conflict prevention into our engagement and dialogue with the rest of the world."
"This is particularly relevant in the case of Africa."
"There are 290 million people living below the poverty line in sub-Saharan Africa."
"An estimated 30 million are infected with HIV/AIDS."
"Over a dozen conflict situations make this humanitarian crisis even worse."
"We must work with our African partners to find comprehensive solutions to these problems."

"I would like to see greater convergence between foreign and development policy and this will form part of our approach as a presidency."
"The Union has a critical role to play in responding to major developing challenges such as poverty alleviation, the fight against infectious diseases and environmental degradation."
"The Union must set an example in relation to the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and the creation of a fairer and more stable world order."

"We would also hope to hold an EU-Japan Summit during our term."
"As I have already stated, the Irish presidency looks forward to working closely with Parliament in the coming months."
"It is essential that we cooperate effectively and that we get down to work immediately."
"There is a range of important dossiers which require close cooperation if they are to be satisfactorily progressed in the time available to us."
"The discussions on the Members’ Statute are of particular concern."
"I pay tribute to President Cox for his personal commitment to bringing closure to these discussions."
"The Parliament vote, in December, provides the basis for us to move forward together to achieve an agreement which has eluded our institutions for too long."
"The Irish presidency hopes to conclude this matter rapidly and is doing all in its power to deliver a positive outcome."
"As we move further into the 21st century, I have no doubt that the Union will continue to develop and to grow, to broaden and to deepen."
"The Union must meet new challenges and exploit new opportunities that lie ahead."
"There will continue to be healthy debate and differing perspectives among us."
"We will continue to work to accommodate this enriching diversity."
"We must tackle these challenges and embrace these opportunities together, united by our shared interest in the success of the Union."
"The founding fathers were inspired by the dream of a future in which Europeans would never again fight each other to the death over resources, over territory or over their beliefs; a future in which Europeans would never again be divided from each other."
"This year will see that dream – a Europe whole and healed – brought closer to reality."
"The founding fathers dreamt also of a Europe in which ever-closer cooperation would deliver greater security and prosperity for its people."
"I stand before you as a firm believer in that dream."
"I come from a country where membership of the European Union – a Union which we have helped to shape – has enabled us to develop and to flourish to our fullest potential."
"I profoundly wish the same for the incoming Member States."
"Six months is not a long time."
"But I promise you an Irish presidency that will not stint in its efforts to achieve as much as is possible in this time."
"I greatly look forward to cooperating closely with our partners and with the institutions of the Union, especially with the European Parliament."
"Our agenda is demanding and complex."
"We have begun our work with ambition and with humility."
"We call on everyone to help us with this challenging task for the six months ahead."
"We know that, as Europeans, our strength is our unity."
"We achieve more, and we are at our very best, as 'Europeans – Working Together'."
". Mr President, Prime Minster Ahern, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the best way of opening this debate is to make final assessment of the future, given that events of future months will shape the course of the Union for many years to come."
"I am referring to the key institutional events, such as the parliamentary elections in mid-June and the completion of this Commission’s mandate at the end of October."
"Furthermore, negotiations are about to start on establishing the Union’s future Financial Perspective, and the Commission will soon be presenting its proposals."
"Finally – and here I am moving on to the issues that I will discuss today – this Presidency will see the completion of enlargement and progress will have to be made on the Constitutional Treaty and on our strategy for growth."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, the best wishes that we have exchanged over the last few days are especially valuable and I am sure that Mr Ahern and his colleagues will employ all their determination and ability to ensure that this Presidency is a successful one."
"I will start my brief speech by referring to enlargement."
"After years of meticulous preparation, 1 May 2003 will really be a day of celebration."
"I am glad that these celebrations will be centred on Dublin, because the Irish people are known for their exuberance and conviviality."
"I am pleased that this celebration will be geared towards young people in particular, from whom we have a lot to learn, especially in times of difficulty when there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm about the future."
"Enlargement will bring about significant changes for all our institutions."
"At a practical level, work will continue on the internal organisation of the Commission, and I will report back to you on this in good time."
"Furthermore, I am stepping up my consultations with the governments of the new Member States in order to appoint new Commissioners."
"Work is progressing very quickly and so I can confirm that at the end of February – as early as was called for by Parliament – I will let you have the names of the Commissioners so that you can duly proceed to the hearings that have been proposed."
"The aim is, of course, to integrate the new members of the College as from 1 May 2004, after they have been approved by Parliament."
"The celebrations in Dublin will be a symbolic moment, which will open up new horizons."
"This monumental step is like a mountain pass: when we get there, a new landscape will of course unfold before us."
"We will see the final frontiers of the Union, which will be complete when it welcomes the countries of the Western Balkans."
"From this height we will be able to see the new neighbours of the enlarged Europe with whom, as Mr Ahern mentioned, we want to create an area of cooperation, stability, security and peace."
"We have already embarked upon this task with the circle of friendly countries, which increases the possibility of far-reaching and systematic cooperation with the European Union from the Mediterranean to Russia."
"We propose the European model as a way of structuring relations between countries outside of Europe; everyone is hugely interested in this model: in Asia, in Latin America, everywhere."
"In recent years, the world, which has become less secure, has gone through a period of profound uncertainty."
"I am therefore pleased by the call from the Irish Presidency to promote strong and effective multilateralism, respect for human rights and conflict prevention: these principles are European principles."
"The Union must indeed strengthen relations with the United Nations and try to find more common ground with all the major players on the world stage, starting with the United States and Russia, and thus we are right on track."
"We must work together with the Member States to help Secretary-General Kofi Annan – whom we will meet in two weeks time – to push ahead with the reform of the United Nations, an organisation that we want to be strong, effective and present wherever peace is under threat, where people are in need of aid, where human rights need protecting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, threats to security and world peace are not posed simply by armed conflicts and groups that are prepared to fight to achieve their goals."
"Whilst we must show determination in opposing and neutralising terrorist organisations, conflict situations must be resolved at political level."
"I therefore agree with the proposals made by the Irish Presidency to concentrate Union measures on humanitarian aid, respect for human rights and on the political, economic and social factors that fuel war and violence."
"I would now like to turn briefly to the issue of the Constitutional Treaty, which was the thorniest issue on the agenda of the Presidency that has just concluded."
"Firstly, I would like to say how satisfied I am with the Presidency’s announcement that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will begin again."
"For the Commission, adopting this Constitution is an absolute priority: both the Irish and the Dutch Presidencies can count on our continued support."
"2004 must be the year of the European Constitution."
"The December summit clearly showed that the existing stumbling blocks would not be insurmountable if the Member States made a further effort to extend the consensus – which was huge – on the Convention’s proposals."
"If this development occurs – and I know that Mr Ahern is a master of patience and persuasion – then agreement may not be far away."
"The cost of slowing down the process of integration is too great."
"Clearly, there are risks involved in any situation and the Commission insists that we all move together towards a form of integration that is more solid and which enjoys broader agreement."
"If the efforts to this end were to fail repeatedly – and I do hope that this does not happen – then we could not, of course, oppose better solutions from other quarters but, I repeat, this does not apply to the historic phase in which we are currently working: we are now working towards us all having a Constitution shared by all the Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to finish my speech with the European measures for economic growth, to which you referred very clearly."
"On this subject, your programme contains a wealth of ideas and is also ambitious; it could not be otherwise, since this Presidency will host the Spring Summit, which is the main meeting to set out the economic strategy."
"After several difficult years, the economy finally seems to be picking up: not too enthusiastically, but at least there has been some improvement."
"The climate is becoming favourable to stimulating economic activity."
"This is not the place to repeat any analysis of the objectives set out in the Presidency’s programme – which will, I guarantee, receive the Commission’s full support – and so I will just give a brief review of the ideas underlying the strategy in question."
"The Spring Council will continue in the direction outlined in the Lisbon strategy, which remains the only basis that will allow Europe and its economy to maintain – I am not saying to increase, simply to maintain – its prosperity, security, social justice in a globalised world."
"The Commission will, therefore, make its proposals and the Council will take its decisions; no decision will be able to bear fruit until the decisions become real policies at national level, and so we need the cooperation of the Member States to be harmonised."
"The key priorities must be knowledge and innovation, that is to say, a single priority: human resources, full stop."
"That is the priority."
"Investment in education, lifelong learning and in research are not theoretical problems, but an objective that must be pursued at once because our international competitors are overtaking us, or have already done so."
"We must, therefore, step up our efforts to become a knowledge-based economy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we look beyond the here and now, it is clear that our growth depends primarily on developing human resources and knowledge."
"I would again like to stress the need to create research centres of excellence in Europe and at world level, or even better, that are the best in the world."
"They must be the tangible and fundamental symbol of our belief in the future, that – as Mr Ahern said – the future is something we can shape and make happen."
"National strategies alone will not produce cutting-edge research; we need a strategy for the continent, we need the whole of the Union to pull together."
"Our continent must once again become what it was for centuries: the reference point for researchers across the world."
"We must put in place measures to allow young people who are currently specialising elsewhere to return to Europe when they have completed their studies."
"There is no point in me giving you facts and figures: here the issue is that hundreds of thousands of people are educated here and go elsewhere, or are educated elsewhere and go elsewhere."
"We are thus out of the loop of cultivating human resources in the world: either we re-enter it or the Lisbon strategy will not be fully achieved."
"There is only one way forward possible: fundamental research and disseminating education throughout the European workforce."
"Our young people must be able to find opportunities to study, work and be successful in Europe: that is their right."
"I say this not only for the sake of young people, but also because their success is the key to our own survival."
"This must, therefore, be the aim of our policies and our effort to meet the expectations of the people of Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, just before Christmas the political group chairmen had an opportunity to speak to the then-incoming Irish Presidency: with the Taoiseach, Foreign Minister Brian Cowen and the Minister for Europe, Dick Roche."
"I can tell you that the meeting was professional, efficient and amicable."
"I think this bodes very well for a successful Irish Presidency and by happy coincidence we have an Irish President of the European Parliament."
"I would also like to mention Gerard Collins, the co-chairman of an important group here in the European Parliament, who we first met when he was still Foreign Minister."
"The Irish Presidency of the time performed excellently, and I wish you every success in the coming six months as well."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the Constitution."
"For my group, for the European People’s Party section of it, the Constitution is the number one priority."
"The Constitution project cannot be allowed to fail simply because the Brussels Summit was unsuccessful."
"You will have our full support if you manage to resolve matters during the Irish Presidency."
"Everyone needs to move into action now."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats may support the principle of double majority for decision-making in the Council of Ministers, but it cannot now be considered a fundamental principle whereby we say that if it is not accepted, the whole Constitution project will fail – certainly not."
"The Constitution is so important a subject that we must move towards one another."
"A compromise must be found, and we need everyone to work together to that end."
"Then there is the discussion about ‘core Europe’ or a two-speed Europe."
"I would advise against any such discussion."
"It is inherently wrong."
"How would a core group work?"
"How would a two-speed Europe work?"
"It is the wrong approach, but it is also seen as a threat to make certain governments move in a particular direction."
"Let us stop talking about a two-speed Europe, let us create this Constitution and move forward together."
"Mr President-in-Office, the elections for the European Parliament fall during your Presidency."
"The Convention’s draft Constitution says – although of course it is not yet in force – that the results of the European Parliament elections will be taken into account when the Commission President is appointed."
"I do not know whether your Presidency will actually make a proposal for the office of Commission President at the end of June, after the elections."
"I can only encourage and ask you to respect the results of the European Parliament elections if you do."
"It is a question of principle."
"Our group is not willing to repeat the events of 1999, when one side won the elections and the other side took up offices in the Commission."
"This time the results of the European elections must be taken into account."
"The Commission as a whole must be balanced."
"As President of the Commission – you are laughing, and I am always pleased to see you happy –you are already being asked for your opinion, even now, on the subject of appointing the ten Commissioners from the accession countries."
"Please ensure that there is a cross-party political balance when you appoint the Commissioners."
"Mr President-in-Office, you went on to speak about our relationship with the United States of America."
"Let me underline everything you said."
"We do not want to be the United States’ lackeys, but neither are we her rivals."
"We want to be partners with the United States, with equal rights, speaking on an equal footing with our American friends, and on many issues we share common goals."
"Anyone who believes that Europe has to be defined by contrast with the United States not only has it wrong in treating the United States, as it were, as an enemy, but would also split Europe itself, because we have different views on how we should structure our relationship with the United States."
"Consequently, I can only advise that we consider ourselves partners and equals of the United States."
"It is up to us to establish that equality."
"Rather than constantly criticising American dominance, we should do our utmost to ensure we, as Europeans, are united, and then we will be on an equal footing with the United States."
"This does not mean that we ought not to criticise our American friends at all."
"For example, I consider the current situation in Guantanamo Bay unacceptable."
"No one on this earth – no terrorist, no one – should be without rights."
"Everyone in the world is subject to a system of law."
"We should tell our American friends so."
"Please include it in all documents we exchange with them."
"The same holds true for Chechnya."
"We are always told: yes, yes, we have talked to the Russian President about Chechnya."
"We would like to see it in black and white: a statement that Chechnya will also be dealt with, that we will intervene to uphold human rights and that we also have the courage to address world leaders – or those who consider themselves as such – on such matters."
"So my request to you is: give human rights a chance, again by referring to them in documents and agreements."
"This applies both to Guantanamo Bay and to Chechnya."
"Let us respect one another: the small respecting the large, the large respecting the small, the majority respecting minorities."
"Europe can only work if we understand others, and if we respect one another."
"There should be no domination, and I thought it would be good to ask, in all modesty, everyone to do their bit."
"That is exactly what we need."
"Everyone needs to do their bit for a united Europe."
"Our group will stand alongside you."
"We wish you every success."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Taoiseach, , which according to my poor Gaelic means ‘a hundred thousand welcomes’: you are more generous than the Spanish, who say in the plural."
"I would like to welcome the arrival of the Irish Presidency, because fate and the timetable have placed you right at the European Union’s important political crossroads."
"It was you who began the process – while I was President of the European Parliament – in Dublin, in March 1990, which led to Maastricht, you played a decisive role as the Presidency in relation to the Stability Pact and now you have an enormous responsibility."
"As well as participating in the Conference of Presidents, in December, the Bureau of my group last week visited Dublin and we had the opportunity to hold a full debate with the and the Irish Government;"
"I would like to say, on behalf of my group that we finally have a reliable, experienced and serious interlocutor."
"Following what we have just experienced – a Presidency full of political extravagances and boasting in the media – I believe this is a very significant step forward."
"We can have faith in you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"I personally went to ask you to support us in the Convention – you are not from my political family – but you supported us in this challenge from the outset."
"As well as having experience – since being negotiator of the Single Act and participant in the subsequent reforms of the Treaties – you know what you are talking about and have demonstrated your seriousness."
"With regard to the Constitution, I would like to note, firstly, the decisive attitude of the Irish Presidency, a prudent but firm attitude – , as the Latins said, (we must press forward slowly and prudently) – and I hope that you can present us with proposals in March."
"I do not want to enter into controversial territory, I believe that Parliament’s position has also been prudent, firm and serious and I hope that with the Irish Presidency we manage to unravel this extremely important issue."
"Because a Constitution is absolutely essential to us if we are to consolidate an enlarged Europe and make it work in a democratic manner."
"I have taken good note, Mr President, of the ’s comments on the Members’ Statute, which my group sees as a question of constitutional dignity."
"The second important challenge is economic."
"The President has talked about an issue which is very important, and in relation to which Ireland offers an example to the current Union and to the enlarged Union, which is the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"In other words, achieving, as we Socialists believe, full employment, gender equality – I would like to welcome the fact that the Irish Government has been the first to appoint a female Ambassador to Coreper, thereby entering into the most sexist realm of the Union, I congratulate it – social cohesion and technological development."
"You can also set a good example in terms of solidarity, because we are now going to begin to renegotiate the financial perspectives, because ultimately, if we are going to get married we must also talk about the dowry and the marriage settlements, and that is where we are going to see solidarity."
"In this regard, I would like to say, Mr President, that we naturally support the proposals from the Commission which at least maintain the current effort."
"We cannot set many more objectives while providing fewer resources and it is not acceptable for one or several governments to tell us that in order to do many more things we must provide much fewer resources."
"We must respect the work of the Commission and its responsibility, and I hope that it makes proposals as soon as possible, and that the Irish Presidency can interpret them."
"We must also provide a future for the Stability and Growth Pact."
"With regard to international policy, I would like to stress two elements: one is the President-in-Office of the Council’s insistence on the value of human rights at world level and the importance of Kofi Annan’s visit, because it is an affirmation of Europe's attachment to multilateralism."
"I believe that the Irish Presidency also has the capacity and experience to take this forward."
"Finally, Mr President, an important issue, since we are in an election campaign and my distinguished colleague, Mr Poettering, has raised the issue."
"I believe that the important thing, from the point of view of the European Parliament and democracy in Europe, is that the Irish Presidency applies the Simitis-Cox Agreement to the letter, taking the form of an exchange of letters, according to which the Council will have to propose the candidate to the Presidency of the Commission after the European elections."
"As far as that we are all in agreement and I hope that the Irish Presidency will comply with it."
"With regard to the European elections, the issue is open, nobody has won them and I would like to ask my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the technical group of European conservatives, to explain to me what you have in common with the British Conservatives in relation to Europe."
"There are no majorities here."
"Majorities, in European democratic systems, when there are no absolute majorities, are created on the basis of programme agreements."
"I accept that you advocate a conservative programme, and we advocate a progressive programme, but everything is open and we are all going to win the elections, or at least we will also be winners."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, at the beginning of the last century, a disgruntled writer from Dublin went to live in Italy."
"He wrote a famous novel in Trieste, a city that some years after his death came to mark the southern end of a line which divided our continent for half a century."
"This year, under this Irish presidency, that line will finally be erased."
"History, as Stephen Daedelus reminded us in James Joyce's , is a nightmare from which we are trying to awake."
"The Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement."
"It is an historic moment: the final act of the revolutions of 1989."
"It is appropriate that a country which speaks for the transformative power of the European Union should oversee that process."
"But we should not be tempted to believe that we can separate enlargement from agreement on the instrument designed to make that step possible."
"Integrating the new Member States into the Lisbon process and Schengen cannot hide the fact that without the additional framework of a new constitutional settlement we are simply changing the oil in a Union which needs a new engine."
"Liberals in this House welcome the Taoiseach's strong commitment to advancing the work of the IGC."
"December's tempers have cooled."
"Europe's destiny is in an altogether safer pair of hands."
"This time, Europe's leaders must choose to succeed."
"My Group also welcomes the presidency's intention to sustain the momentum of enlargement by concluding accession talks with Romania and Bulgaria and by responding to the request from Croatia."
"We, too, see this as the moment to achieve an historic settlement with Cyprus."
"The presidency also rightly focuses, too, on the Lisbon Agenda in what can only be called its hour of need."
"Most of the structural problems identified at Lisbon remain obstacles to wealth creation."
"The political will needed to undertake reform and give the eurozone credibility has not yet clearly been summoned."
"The Celtic tiger has long stood for the benefits of competitiveness and economic discipline."
"Now it is time for you to roar in the Council."
"We welcome the commitments on the Framework Directive on Services, published by the Commission yesterday, and on the Financial Services Action Plan."
"We welcome the commitment to work with the European Parliament to secure the adoption of the Trans-European Networks proposals."
"But your modesty about what you can achieve must not obscure the need to resurrect the Growth and Stability Pact in some form under this presidency."
"The presidency's assessment of our agenda abroad is also sound."
"We welcome the focus on African issues, on the holocaust of AIDS and poverty and hunger."
"We accept the need to work constructively with Russia, although we expect hard words on Chechnya and on Russia's vanishing political pluralism."
"We welcome the attempts to rebuild bridges in our transatlantic friendships."
"But here the Council's loyalty to European values means that Guantanamo Bay must be on the agenda of the EU-US Summit."
"The EU must act together to demand conscionable treatment for all detainees in Camp Delta, including the Europeans who have now been held for two years without charge."
"I welcome, Mr President-in-Office, your commitment to review justice and home affairs in the Union."
"I hope you will not overlook the worrying Amnesty International report on human rights within some of our own member countries."
"My Group welcomes the presidency's political commitment to take the Statute for Members forward."
"That commitment must now be carried through into reform by both Parliament and the Council so that the statute can enter into force after the elections."
"Mr President-in-Office, your work programme is a worthy one."
"If my Group could offer you a slogan for it, it would be 'restoring belief'."
"Deliver a deal on the Constitution and see in enlargement and you will have done Europe, and Ireland, proud."
"Carry that spirit through to the European elections in June, to a pan-European campaign with a continental consciousness rather than 25 national campaigns, and history will give you rich reward."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, when observers talk about the difficulties that the Irish Presidency is going to face, they all stress the fact that the constitutional process is deadlocked."
"I fear that this will mean that we will not see the wood for the trees."
"To my mind, what happened at the Brussels summit and its conclusion were only symptoms of a deeper problem: the lack of a common plan, or in any case of a plan with which Europeans can identify."
"The challenge that we now have to meet is more ambitious, much more ambitious than seeking a compromise of power between two black sheep in the European Council."
"It is to dare to go beyond what is left unsaid, the soothing proposals, the Community hangover, and dare to call a spade a spade and a crisis a crisis."
"Being critical is a rare commodity in both the Council and the Commission."
"This is why I am convinced that our fellow citizens would appreciate the major change of talking truthfully and responsibly about what is not working properly in the Union and calling for changes."
"There are currently numerous examples of such taboos that need to be lifted."
"I will just mention three of them that are particularly fundamental."
"First of all, there are the crises of the euro and the stability pact, because the two problems are linked."
"The creation of the European currency was supposed to stimulate growth, promote employment and strengthen the Union in relation to its main competitors."
"What has happened so far?"
"The economy is sluggish, there is massive unemployment and the euro zone is unflinchingly enduring Washington’s predatory monetary policy."
"This must change."
"The solutions to this that have been put forward do not seem to be credible to me or seem to be no longer credible."
"We are also being told that the Lisbon strategy is going to have new momentum."
"But where has all the momentum that we have had for nearly four years got us to in terms of growth and employment?"
"Great importance is also attached to major projects."
"There is no doubt that they correspond to very real needs, but by mainly using private capital, the scope of them is being significantly limited."
"The President of the EIB, Philippe Maystadt, acknowledges that the private sector (and I quote) ‘is interested as long as the projects are sufficiently profitable’, there is no secret about that."
"He goes on to say, to quote him again, that ‘the expression ‘growth initiative’ can lead to confusion."
"It is in no way a measure for trying to encourage a restart in the short term’."
"These are the circumstances under which the stability pact is supposed to continue as if there were no negative effects on public spending, as if it were to be aimed, as we would like, at renovating hospitals for example or developing research."
"Commissioner Solbes is going to bring before the ECJ those States that have committed the crime, of – and I quote, ‘replacing a system based on respecting rules with a system based on political decisions’ – as if this crisis in the EU were not forcing us to review the rules and launch into detailed political discussions."
"This must change."
"The second example of a crisis, which is quite significant, is that of the financial perspectives, and therefore of the solidarity policy at the time of enlargement."
"It was the Commission that, several months ago, triggered the former."
"On the basis of the famous Sapir report, drawn up at its request, it took responsibility for accrediting the unacceptable idea of a reduction in the Structural Funds after 2006."
"More recently, the shameful initiative of the six richest countries in the EU drove the nail in: freezing the budget at 1 per cent of Gross Domestic Product from 2007, at a time when we are preparing to welcome ten new countries whose income per inhabitant is lower than half the average for the Fifteen."
"As there is no possibility in their minds of calling into question, the principle of the UK style refund, extracted twenty years ago by the ‘Iron Lady’, it is the solidarity funds that will provide the adjustment variable."
"Will we discuss this matter on 1 May, at the enlargement celebrations?"
"If we want to make a success of this major project, this too is a factor that needs to be changed."
"Finally, there is well and truly a crisis in terms of the EU’s external action."
"One year after the major clash of choices at world level regarding Iraq, we have gained a great deal of experience."
"We now know that a State lied about weapons of mass destruction."
"We now know that a major power can win a war alone but is powerless to win peace."
"We also know that the occupation of Iraq is in fact feeding the terrorism that it was supposed to overcome."
"Everyone now knows all of this, but the Union is incapable of saying so and of learning lessons from it."
"This must change."
"In the Middle East, which is urgently appealing for us to reinvigorate Europe’s role, the building of the annexing wall, stone by stone, is giving rise only to tentative statements."
"What are we doing to protect the Palestinian people?"
"What are we doing to support the courageous efforts of Israeli and Palestinian figures who are unprecedentedly working to restart dialogue and negotiations?"
"What are we doing to speed up the international conference planned in the route map?"
"To be honest, we are doing very little."
"This must change."
"My group sees all of these expectations of Europe that are being expressed in different regions of the world as an excellent opportunity that we should grasp."
"I am thinking of Latin America, where democracy is emerging, which is standing up to the hegemonic designs of the White House and is seeking genuine partners who respect its identity and sovereignty."
"I am thinking of the most heavily indebted countries which, given the obvious failure of initiatives from international financial institutions, are suffocating, with no concern from the international community."
"I am thinking of our partners who were disappointed in the Barcelona process, whose grievances we need to listen to so that we can restart Euro-Mediterranean and, more generally speaking, Euro-Arab relations."
"May the Irish Presidency, , take strong action in these different areas that can bring to life the image of a Europe that listens more to the criticism it receives and the hopes that it raises."
"This is what I see as your greatest task."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we have to ask ourselves a very simple question: is Europe as a whole sustainable?"
"When I say ‘we’, I mean the Council, the Commission, Parliament."
"I have heard some astounding things in this Chamber."
"I hear that Europe is a success story – how nice – and that we have an historical opportunity – how nice. Then, Mr President-in-Office, you said how wonderful it is that the Convention has done excellent work."
"To which my response is: take it, if it is so good."
"Then you can say: forget Mr Blair’s ‘red lines’."
"The Convention has done an excellent job, so let us get on with it."
"Next, along comes Mr Poettering and says we have to compromise."
"Of course there will have to be compromises – but based on what?"
"Based on self-interest, thereby making Europe unsustainable?"
"The principle of double majority is not a mythical creature."
"We have to decide for once and for all whether Europe will be capable of taking decisions in the future."
"If individual states have the power to block decisions, making them will no longer be viable."
"If you want applause from the Spaniards, perhaps you could explain to me how Europe can have an effective decision-making process using approaches such as those suggested by Mr Aznar."
"His proposal will not allow effective decision-making."
"That must be acknowledged now, or else there is little point in continuing."
"The discussions in the Chamber did not end there."
"Mr President-in-Office, you spoke of Lisbon, of being prepared for the future, of social cohesion – all excellent."
"Then we read a letter from a Mr Schröder, a Mr Blair, a Mr Chirac, and someone else, a Dutch Prime Minister, which says that Europe is expanding, but will have less money."
"That is the most creative economics I have ever seen!"
"If you expand, you pay less: how is that for logical reasoning?"
"And yes, I will tell Mr Fischer so."
"Mr Poettering, perhaps you could ask your own ministers, Mr Schäuble and Mr Lamers, who thought up this two-speed Europe?"
"It was not some stupid Social Democrat or Communist: it was your very own Mr Schäuble, potentially the next Federal President of Germany, and he did it in order to keep Spain and Italy out of the euro."
"That is the true history of two-speed Europe."
"Your own Helmut Kohl also did his bit, with the Schäuble/Lamers paper."
"You seem to rewrite history as it suits you."
"While I have the floor, let me add the following: Mr Poettering, you stood up in this House and said, ‘we will not allow it’."
"You will have to accept whatever the majority in this House votes for."
"Either"
"you will have the majority or we will, and the President of the Commission will be appointed accordingly."
"You may be the largest group, but you are far from being the majority."
"Mr Barón Crespo is right: go ahead and form a majority with the British Conservatives, and I will be interested to see what kind of President you get for the Commission."
"That is something I would like to see."
"There is something else I would like to say: let me add something else."
"You stand up here and announce what you do and do not want."
"Tell us for once and for all, and tell the Presidency."
"Either we want Europe to be based on human rights and the rule of law, in which case there is one road open to us, namely, to be honest."
"We agree on this, that we have to tell Mr Putin the truth about Chechnya, and that is what the Presidency should be doing."
"We have to tell it straight to China: that is what Mr Schröder ought to do."
"Not only is it folly to lift the arms embargo – in view of human rights in China, of their policy on Taiwan, of their policy on Tibet,"
"it is criminal."
"We have to tell them so."
"Then we need to talk straight to Iran."
"Then there is Hanau: we have to be straight with China about this Hanau nonsense."
"It is foolish to operate as a weapons dealer and to work towards increasing the number of uranium treatment facilities."
"These comments are also aimed at Mr Brok, whose party in the Bundestag supports the move, and at Mr Schröder."
"The list goes on: we also have to be honest with Iran."
"Giving money towards destruction – as is being done in Iran at the moment – is a political disaster for democracy."
"We have to tell Iran that."
"Then, if we really do support the rule of law and democracy, let us simply follow the Brazilians’ example."
"In Brazil, they have decided that if their citizens have to have their photograph and fingerprints taken when they travel to the United States, then all US citizens who come to Brazil will have to do the same."
"That means that if Americans come to Europe,"
"they will also have to have their fingerprints and photograph taken."
"Equality all round!"
"Only then will we be partners worthy of respect."
"To close, I would like to touch on the Stability Pact and the Commission."
"President Prodi, it was heroic to declare this Stability Pact a load of nonsense."
"Your decision to take legal action against the Council was foolish, because you were unable to reform the Stability Pact even though it is not working."
"It is just as stupid to defend a rule that does not work as to defend a stupid rule."
"We all have to acknowledge the fact."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, it is a very great pleasure for me and my Irish UEN colleagues to welcome here the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, our political party leader, as President-in-Office of the Council."
"Europe is very fortunate at this particular time to have the presidency held by a Prime Minister who is one of the longest-serving heads of government in any of our Member States."
"In fact, the President-in-Office and myself are co-signatories to the Maastricht Treaty."
"With regard to the IGC, the failure to reach agreement at the December Brussels Summit is, undoubtedly, a serious setback for the European Union, but it is not a crisis."
"The Union will continue to function on the basis of the existing Treaties and the process of enlargement, with the accession of ten new countries on 1 May 2004."
"However, a hastily reconvened summit and a second failure to reach agreement on a constitutional treaty would quickly plunge the European Union into crisis."
"After the summit failure, the immediate need was for a period of calm reflection by Member State governments and EU institutions."
"I am delighted that the Irish presidency has already embarked on an intensive programme of consultations with fellow Member State governments during the first working week of its presidency."
"I am also pleased to note that the Irish Government is most diligent in seeking clarification on the results of the bilateral meetings which took place at the end of the last presidency."
"It is important – indeed essential – to determine the exact position in which we find ourselves at the earliest possible opportunity."
"It is now time for all those involved in EU decision-making to demonstrate the necessary discipline and patience to avoid further failures and to await the report of the presidency to the Spring Summit."
"All of us must avoid inflaming the debate by raising issues which could be interpreted as threatening in many national capitals."
"It is not helpful at this time to have some Member States threatening to reduce the size of the European Union budget."
"Nor is it helpful to have Member States floating the idea of a two-speed Europe."
"The European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must do everything possible to ensure that the idea of a two-speed Europe does not gather momentum."
"If some Member States wish to move forward at a faster pace on specific issues, then the enhanced cooperation mechanism already exists to enable them to do so."
"Already some, but not all, Member States are involved in the eurozone and the Schengen Agreement."
"These methods could be applied to other sectors or issues if necessary."
"However, the suggestion that a small group of Member States could forge ahead, creating a two-speed Europe, is vastly different in scope."
"It is a highly destructive proposal, which could put at risk the effectiveness and even the very existence of the European Union."
"The debate on the IGC and treaty reform should be characterised by caution and by mature reflection."
"It is far more important to obtain a good result than an early result."
"The Spring Summit will also focus on the Lisbon Agenda and I welcome the presidency's proposal to give renewed impetus to the reform goals agreed at Lisbon."
"It is in all our interests that the objective of making Europe the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 be achieved."
"Some progress has been made and we are still a long way from achieving the agreed targets."
"We must focus on polices which will improve European competitiveness and productivity, while investing more on research and new product development."
"This is one area where the European Union can have a practical effect on citizens' lives by improving living standards and increasing environment opportunities."
"It is regrettable that some Member States are now advocating a reduction in the size of the EU budget."
"At a time when the European Union is expanding to include ten new countries and when these countries are making stringent efforts to encourage economic growth, we have a duty at least to give these countries access to resources, which the existing fifteen have had access to in the past."
"It is in all our interests to encourage these countries to reach their maximum potential as soon as possible."
"The Commission will shortly bring forward proposals on the next financial perspectives."
"The Commission should ensure that the resources in future EU budgets are sufficient to provide for a continuation of existing EU programmes in an expanded Union of 25."
"A related issue concerns the budgetary powers of this Parliament, where different suggestions have been tabled to increase and decrease the role of Parliament in this area."
"I support Parliament's view in insisting on maintaining its existing powers over the budget."
"In external relations, as with previous presidencies, the Middle East will once again be a priority issue."
"I am pleased to note that this week Minister Cowen, as President-in-Office, is making an official visit to the Middle East, where I am confident he will make every effort to move forward the peace process in that region."
"The Irish presidency should concentrate its efforts on implementing the roadmap and ensuring that its partners in the quartet are committed to this goal."
"Only the roadmap provides the basis on which progress can be made towards a just and lasting two-state solution."
"The priority that the presidency is giving to US relations is to be welcomed."
"The US is our biggest trading partner and is a country with which Europe has strong cultural and historical links."
"We have had political differences in the recent past but the time has now come to put these problems behind us."
"Indeed, I am of the view that the transatlantic relationship has not yet adapted fully to the new set of circumstances which exist following the collapse of the Iron Curtain, the effective removal of a security threat to Europe from the East and the emergence of the United States as the world's only superpower."
"Ireland is particularly well placed to improve relations with our American friends and I hope that the Irish presidency will further strengthen and deepen relations between the Eruopean Union and the United States."
"Mr President, before Christmas, the group chairmen were in Dublin to negotiate with the Irish Presidency."
"We spent some useful hours with Bertie and Dick and were able to welcome them."
"In this House, I shall welcome Mr Ahern and Mr Roche on a more official basis."
"I am certain that, as a small country, Ireland will deliver an outstanding Presidency."
"I myself come from a small country in which we are on first-name terms with the prime minister and his closest rivals for the job."
"My friends in Dublin sometimes meet Bertie Ahern at the local pub."
"That closeness to the electorate is something to which I would ask the Irish Presidency to draw attention at the next European Council."
"How do we put the people at the centre of the debates concerning the Treaty?"
"How do we make the voters into those who decide, in the EU too?"
"Do not get involved in the present fight concerning the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers."
"Do not breach an agreement entered into with Poland."
"Look at the minority statement from the Convention which, in actual fact, contains the key to the future."
"We propose, as the main rule, that decisions must be made by 75% of the countries in the Council of Ministers, with all the countries being equal and having one vote each."
"The 75% must also represent half of the voters."
"This is out of particular consideration for the most populous countries, but we also propose that special account be taken of all the electorates: all the EU countries, both large and small, should have the right of veto on really vital matters."
"We accept that majority decisions are the point of departure. It should be possible to use the right of veto if this is agreed to at a public meeting in the national parliament and if the prime minister is prepared to defend its use at the next EU summit."
"This is a sustainable compromise which combines the democratic principle that the voters always have the last word with efficient international decision-making."
"Without the right of veto on vital issues, no efficiency is achieved."
"There are merely permanent battles and confusion where the Member States do not administer the common decisions."
"Look, however, at the statistics for the implementation of EU legislation. That is the reality."
"Parliamentary democracy must not be ignored."
"Without majority decisions, however, the result is permanent discussions of practical issues too, in relation to which all the countries have a common interest in its being possible, as a general rule, for them to vote their way to solutions."
"We need to take both considerations equally seriously."
"The draft Convention has neglected to satisfy parliamentary democracy in our Member States, and it will, therefore, scarcely be possible to agree to such democracy in the form of fair referendums, with full information supplied."
"Let it come down to a test, however."
"Instead of organising a second referendum in Ireland if the electorate votes no, you should involve the other countries in the demand that the draft Constitution be voted on in referendums in all the countries and, preferably, on the same day throughout the EU."
"Dear Irish Presidency, we look forward to cooperating with you and will offer our affectionate, critical, constructive and democratic opposition."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council may find it strange that I should be welcoming the Irish Republic's presidency today, but I know that he will understand my intention because he is going to be so busy over the next six months that we will not have to tolerate his presence at meetings in Northern Ireland."
"We will be able to get on with our business, as so overwhelmingly decided by the electorate, and he can get on with his."
"We wish him a fair wind only as regards that particular issue."
"We in Northern Ireland have problems."
"The new President-in-Office of the Council has said that he would not tolerate having any members of the IRA/Sinn Fein in the Dublin Government, but insists that we tolerate them if we are to have a government in Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom."
"I trust he will learn over the next six months to become consistent and no longer tell us to accept something that he would not tolerate."
"I well understand his forced optimism today regarding the new constitutional proposal but agree with the last speaker that the Union should decide on this democratically, with every part of that Union holding a referendum to decide on the issue so that the people can voice their opinion."
"This would constitute a step towards stability and progress."
"Realistically, I do not think there can be a mighty leap forward in the six months of this presidency."
"There are many things that need to be attended to."
"The President-in-Office made a few remarks about human rights, which I think are a very important part of our agenda."
"On that subject, the matter of paedophile priests and their victims, which affects the whole of the European Union, is one of very serious consequence to us all."
"I trust that this matter, which the President-in-Office knows something about as it affects the country of which he is Prime Minister, will be attended to."
"There must be no cover-up and the problem must be addressed directly by this Parliament and the European Union."
"There are also other matters, like agriculture and fisheries, to deal with."
"The people whom I represent in this House were sadly disappointed and very angry at the attitude the government headed by the President-in-Office has shown to the fishing industry."
"He will see the impact of that disappointment and anger in the days to come."
"As for agriculture, we know that this is an industry which needs all the help it can get in both parts of Ireland."
"There is no use talking about helping Poland into a position of power when that could be disastrous for the agriculture interests of other parts of the Union."
"These are matters which the President-in-Office of the Council and this House need to consider thoroughly."
"Mr President, that last contribution is a sad reminder that the doctrine of bigotry is alive and well in certain parts of this Union."
"We still have a lot of work to do in that area."
"Taoiseach, Minister Roche, Ambassador Anderson, I join colleagues in welcoming you here this morning, particularly on behalf of my Irish colleagues in the PPE-DE Group."
"Our presence here, as well as yours, Mr President, in the chair of this august assembly, sends a huge signal to all small Member States that the systems and the processes in Europe allow the smallest of nations to come to the top in the right circumstances."
"I am extremely proud of your presence in the chair and of the Taoiseach's presence here as President of the Council of the European Union for the coming six months."
"I thank you for the honour you bring to our country in that regard."
"Taoiseach, there are those who contend that the only truly important issue to be tackled under the sixth Irish presidency of the European Union is that of the completion of the IGC, the issue of the Constitution."
"Over the past few weeks you have been playing down your chances of delivering on this, certainly on the domestic scene."
"However, having listened to you here this morning, I feel that this might have been merely a political stratagem, dampening down expectations perhaps, and from what you have said – I hope I am right in my interpretation – this is right up there at the top of your agenda and you have all our support in that regard."
"Again we hear the Lisbon Strategy being trotted out: the mantra of Lisbon."
"Quite frankly, at this stage most businesses think that time is running out for Lisbon, if indeed it has not already run out."
"We need concrete action, not just repetitions of wish lists and words."
"What exactly are we going to do in relation to Lisbon?"
"What are we going to do in relation to deregulation to allow businesses to flourish, to allow innovation?"
"Facts please, Taoiseach, specifics please, no more wish lists, because this is the eighth time I have sat here listening to this at the start of a presidency and I find it very hard at the end of every presidency to see what difference has actually been made in relation to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Please tell us before you go today exactly what you intend to do to make the Lisbon goals a reality during your watch."
"Of particular note is the fact that the growth of the US economy, which has outperformed Europe's economy since Lisbon – the gap has grown, not lessened – is driven by its superior research and development."
"In fact, the gap in wealth is stretching every year."
"It is time we acted."
"The Irish presidency must concentrate on a sound framework for European research and innovation."
"I ask you particularly to look at the seventh EU framework programme and to deliver as best you can."
"I would like to acknowledge the historic period of enlargement which will happen under your watch and welcome into the Community our ten new Member States with their considerable scientific enterprise and research skills, which must be harnessed and developed to full capacity."
"We must place emphasis on overall economic growth, but our priority must be to promote employment, more and better jobs in our European Union."
"In the interests of equity, productivity and social stability, we must address the serious issue of Europe's greying population and so we must create the optimum conditions for jobs."
"Two-thirds of Europe's workforce are currently employed in enterprises employing less than 250 people."
"As such, these SMEs are the driving force of European job creation."
"We must focus on simplifying and establishing a supportive regulatory-environment framework which encourages entrepreneurship and reduces this bureaucracy and red tape."
"If you are sincere in what you are saying in advocating for the rest of Europe a knowledge-based economy, perhaps you could start by ensuring that our Irish universities and third-level institutions are adequately funded to allow access to the greatest possible number of young people."
"I should like to ask you to put the ratification of Kyoto, which is essential for progress and for all our futures, way up there at the top of the agenda at the EU-Russia summit."
"Finally, given the well-publicised claim by members of your government that Ireland is closer to Boston than Berlin – a claim from which I dissociate myself – could you at least turn that now to an advantage with your plans to re-establish close transatlantic links given the rift that has ensued following the invasion of Iraq?"
"Again, Taoiseach, I welcome you here this morning and you have my sincere good wishes for a very successful term at the helm of Europe."
"I do not like to irritate colleagues by interrupting them, but I must appeal for your support."
"There are 40 speakers still to speak in this debate and the vote is due to take place at noon."
"We will not be finished in time if speaking times are not respected."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Taoiseach, Minister Roach and Ambassador Anderson this morning."
"I welcome the wide-ranging speech that the Taoiseach made to the House, which covered many key issues with which this House is concerned."
"I wish you and the Irish Government well with the very onerous agenda which it falls to you to push forward."
"I have no doubt that you will carry out your responsibilities with efficiency."
"The most important issue, as you, Taoiseach, and every other speaker emphasised, is the draft Constitution."
"We all wish the IGC could have concluded in December."
"That it did not reflects badly on those who blocked the conclusion, and I include not only Poland and Spain in that criticism."
"The most important objective is to ensure that there is momentum on this issue."
"Europe needs this constitution, which would make the Union more democratic, more socially engaged and more comprehensible to its citizens and would enable us to play a more positive role on the world stage."
"But be warned, Parliament will not accept any old outcome."
"The constitution produced by the Convention must remain largely intact."
"The values, the objectives and the rights of citizens must not be diluted."
"Nor must the budgetary powers of this Parliament be diluted in any way."
"Another key issue is the Lisbon process."
"Europe must advance with social progress hand in hand with economic progress."
"There is no time to go into detail on that issue, but it will be an example of a serious commitment by the Irish Government if it were to drop its opposition to the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, which will help to develop a flexible and adaptable workforce if we address this issue in the correct way."
"It affects millions of workers right across the European Union."
"Finally, I urge you to take up the issue of debt cancellation for developing countries."
"Servicing debt costs the poorest countries more than they receive in development aid."
"A human development approach to debt sustainability with highly indebted countries would mean that the first call on poor countries' government resources would be expenditures needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals."
"For the poorest countries, this will require 100% cancellation of their debts."
"I know the Irish Government is committed to that issue as a government adopting the Irish approach, but I would ask you to put that onto the agenda for the other Member States in Europe and seek to ensure progress is made on it during your six months in office."
"There are many other issues I would like to raise, including the Guantanamo prisoners and the appalling suffering of the Palestinian people, but time does not permit me to do so."
"– Mr President-in-Office, the priorities you have proposed here today deserve a general welcome and just a couple of comments that I shall make. Your varied and complex programme indicates that there is now a programmatic for Europe, a common heritage of ideas and objectives that will increasingly make the Union a necessary institution for Europe and the whole world."
"First of all, this programmatic requires that we should have the rules and institutions that will enable us to achieve our common objectives and, even before that, it requires that trust should be restored in the grand design for the integration of Europe."
"In recent months we have seen too many signs of a selfish attitude towards the European adventure, reducing the Union to a self-service institution in which each country periodically reassesses its membership on the basis of its own short-term goals."
"The breach of the Stability and Growth Pact by France and Germany, which ECOFIN permitted on 25 November, or the vetoes from all sides that prevented the European constitution from being adopted are just the most blatant examples of a kind of Euro-selfishness that must be firmly stamped upon straight away, before everything becomes more difficult in the Europe of 25."
"Mr President-in-Office, please make every effort for the Intergovernmental Conference to conclude its work by approving the Constitution during this Presidency."
"I am sure I can say that Parliament is with you in wanting to achieve this Constitution, based to a great extent on the work of the Convention, as soon as possible. It is an event that all sincere pro-Europeans are waiting for."
"It is with the primary purpose of giving new impetus to the grand design for Europe that I should like to raise two points about your programme of work."
"The first is the scant attention paid to cohesion policies, and the second is the urgent need to develop true physical integration for Europe, promoting mobility everywhere within its area through the implementation of the European transport network."
"The cohesion of the whole of Europe and the involvement of all the regions in the sustainable European process are an expression of that solidarity which I believe is fundamental if European citizens are to identify with the process that we are carrying forward."
"Mr President, the Irish Presidency is very welcome."
"We have high expectations, because we know that small countries such as Ireland are usually able to provide effective and energetic Presidencies."
"It is also important in view of the fact that the previous Italian Presidency was so very poor."
"You have not only your own problems to deal with, but also some of the problems created by the previous Presidency."
"Some of them are in the area of foreign policy."
"I want to mention two of these."
"The Italian Presidency neglected to criticise the enormous human rights violations taking place in Chechnya."
"Now, we expect some plain speaking to be directed to Russia on this fundamental issue of human rights for the civilian population of Chechnya."
"Where Palestine was concerned, there was also another Italian misadventure."
"They tried to pursue a more pro-Israeli policy and had a unilateral meeting with Mr Sharon."
"In the case of Palestine, the reality on the ground is, however, that, by building the wall and expanding its settlements, Israel is on the way to destroying a possible two-State solution and destroying the Palestinians’ prospects of leading normal lives."
"Here too, there is a need for plain language on the part of the EU."
"In the very last few days, Israel has also introduced a kind of visa requirement applicable to the occupied territories, something that also affects EU citizens, aid workers, journalists and others."
"We expect the EU to protest."
"When it comes to the environmental sphere, which is my own speciality, I think, however, that the Presidency’s programme is rather thin and not sufficiently practical."
"You would have done well to have gone a little further in this area."
"For example, you could have mentioned the importance of quickly obtaining sound chemicals legislation and of cooperating with Parliament on this issue."
"The importance of giving more impetus to the climate negotiations is, in itself, referred to, but the EU has an enormous task in this area over the next six months when the Kyoto Protocol is in danger of collapsing."
"Other major issues are the Carthagena Protocol and the biodiversity conference in Kuala Lumpur, where important decisions are going to be taken on trade involving genetically engineered products."
"This has been the EU’s pet area of concern for a long time, and care needs to be taken over it."
"There is another sphere I also think has been rather neglected in this programme, which is otherwise sound."
"I mean the crisis for the currency union."
"It is time to stop pretending."
"The currency union and the Stability and Growth Pact face a serious economic and political crisis."
"This was apparent as recently as yesterday when the Commission chose to bring a case at the EC Court of Justice against the Council’s decision."
"The crisis consists of the fact that unrealistic rules have been devised."
"When reality and the rules collide, a political crisis such as this arises, and there can only be one solution: to review the Stability and Growth Pact as it stands at present."
"– Mr President, our welcome to the Irish Presidency is very sincere, for we know it to be an opportunity for Europe when a small country like yours sets to work in full awareness of its European and global task."
"You are also an example to the new Member States, in that you made a success of your own accession, both for your own people and for the whole of Europe."
"As regionalists and representatives of stateless peoples, we expect from Ireland more understanding for our aspirations towards autonomy and maintaining our own identity, as towards direct participation in European decision-making."
"Whether we are Scotland, Wales, the Basque country, Catalonia, Galicia or Flanders, we expect the same level of respect from the EU as the Baltic States or the Scandinavian countries."
"You can expect our wholehearted support for your prioritisation of a sound European Constitution and for your ambition to make Europe a more effective player at world level for the benefit of peace and sustainable development."
"We therefore hope that you will, for example, continue to curb the arms trade and will ensure that the rules of the code of conduct are observed in the process."
"Ireland boasts long experience in the dialogue with the peoples of the Middle East and as a donor and partner of the countries in Africa, but the millennium agenda should be incorporated more effectively in our day-to-day goals, also as a European Union."
"It is no small feat to have the ambition to halve, by 2015, the number of poor who have to survive on less than 1 dollar a day."
"How much progress have we made on this score?"
"I could, however, also mention the other objectives."
"I should like to make a specific appeal with regard to debt reduction, because many poor countries have to swim along in this global world sea with a millstone of debt around their necks."
"Finally, I hope that sustainable development will not remain an empty shell where it involves our own European policy on sugar, cotton or rice, for that is what we will be judged on."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are inheriting a European Union that is in quite a pitiful state, which has, throughout 2003, shown itself to be fundamentally incapable of responding to the major external and internal challenges faced by the people of Europe."
"Under these circumstances, it would have been quite premature, to say the least, to give this Europe of 25 – which is what it is – a constitution, this being the symbol of a people’s political and democratic maturity."
"We are far from reaching that point."
"You said just now, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we were the elected representatives of the people."
"We are not; we are the elected representatives of the European peoples, until there is evidence to the contrary."
"So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, make more speed with less haste."
"The top priority is not what Mr Poettering is loudly demanding, which is all that his supporters can see."
"The people of Europe do not have the same priorities as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and they do not care about the political leanings of the Commissioners."
"The people of Europe do not need a constitution, which is a matter for institutions."
"They need growth; they need jobs."
"I think that you could make your Presidency a great deal more useful by taking the Union down that road, rather than getting lost in the maze of this supposed constitution."
"In order to restore growth and employment, there needs to be a change of policy."
"The policy followed since the Maastricht Treaty has failed."
"Europe, and specifically the euro zone, is dropping a growth point every year solely due to the restrictive, Malthusian and ultimately somewhat sadistic policy of the European Central Bank, which means that we now have a largely overvalued currency."
"Are we going to accept the European economy being mortgaged for much longer by the ghosts of those whom General de Gaulle would have called ‘the gnomes of Frankfurt’?"
"The greatest danger for Europe, Mr President, for the Lisbon process and for growth and employment, I am sorry to say, is my former compatriot, Mr Trichet."
"Your Presidency will be judged not on the Constitution, you can be sure, but on your ability to make the European currency work for the European economy."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Irish Presidency is today taking on the onerous task of continuing with the Intergovernmental Conference and trying to bring together positions that do not simply differ on technical points, but also due to reasons associated with the concept of sovereignty."
"You said just now, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the new Constitution should meet the expectations of citizens and enable the EU to play a more coherent role in the world."
"If that were all it meant, everyone would be in complete agreement."
"However, there is another fundamental issue that is much more difficult: how can we cooperate while preserving democracy?"
"Do we need to move towards removing the independence of national sovereignty through majority votes, according to the draft constitution, or, as we believe, should we preserve sovereignty and therefore the national democracies of the Member States?"
"We need to explain this issue clearly to citizens and, with this in mind, we urge the Irish Presidency to start doing this, to publicly and accurately set out the IGC’s points of agreement and disagreement."
"Of course, this would not prejudge the outcome, as we are well aware that there is no agreement on anything as long as there is not agreement on everything, but it would at least allow us to begin a genuine debate and seriously inform citizens."
"We also hope that the governments are going to use the coming months to better evaluate the consequences of the plan."
"For example, we read in the priorities of the Irish Presidency, published by the website, ‘Sources d'Europe’, that you ‘would hope’, I said, ‘you would hope’ that the accession negotiations with Turkey could begin at the end of 2004."
"Could you therefore tell us what Turkey’s place would be in the institutions of the future constitution, which would be made to last, as everyone is always telling us?"
"What would its place be in the Council in forty years time?"
"What would its place be in the European Parliament?"
"What would its place be in the new majority decision-making process?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your answers would really fuel the debate."
"Mr President, Taoiseach, I should like to begin by wishing the Irish presidency success in its work over the coming six months."
"You have set out a number of important priorities for action in the period ahead, not least that of kick-starting the Lisbon agenda on economic reform and competitiveness."
"I want to concentrate today on the issue of the draft Constitution and the situation following the failure of the Brussels Summit in December."
"However, as we have made clear on a number of occasions, the Union must also get to grips with advancing the stalled Lisbon process."
"Ireland has made great economic strides in recent years, but throughout the Union there remains a reluctance to embrace genuine economic reform."
"I was pleased to note in the press this week that the Commission wishes to take forward the liberalisation of the internal market in services."
"Such issues are worth tackling in the short to medium term but, as regards the long term, EU Member States need to be more ambitious in their approach."
"However, my enthusiasm is tempered by the reality that liberalisation in areas such as medicine, legal and fiscal advice and employment agencies, whilst worthy, is essentially a distraction from the big picture of further liberalisation in the telecommunications, energy and financial services sectors."
"I urge the Taoiseach to exert his influence over the Union's agenda in the months ahead to promote real and lasting economic reform."
"If he sets the agenda, he will have our full and enthusiastic support."
"On the question of the draft Constitution, which came to grief at Brussels last December, I would simply say this: our view has always been that the draft Constitution was moving the EU in the wrong direction."
"The aspirations of the Laeken Summit two years ago, when the Heads of Government expressed the hope that the Convention would bring the Union closer to its citizens, has singularly failed to materialise."
"I would in any case like to ask the Taoiseach, in the light of the collapse of the talks, to answer one very specific question."
"In recent correspondence I have had with Mr Peter Hain, the British Government's main representative on the Convention, he refers to the ‘Treaty that we agreed at the European Council ...’."
"Does the presidency recognise that a treaty was ‘agreed’, or is it the case, as has been said before, that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed?"
"We all need to have urgent clarification on that."
"– Mr President, we can fully endorse two remarks about the draft Constitution and the Intergovernmental Conference made by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"You spoke, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of the excellent work done by the Convention."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit mocked your comments."
"I will take them seriously and at face value."
"Your words indicate that you will not allow your colleagues at the IGC to destroy that excellent work and again leave it in tatters."
"We know that the IGC will not adopt the draft text exactly as it stands."
"Nevertheless, the draft Constitution is more than just a starting point – it is balanced, fair, and contains all the key elements for a solution."
"In a Union of states and citizens, Mr Poettering, the double majority system forms part of that essential factor: balance."
"That is why it is included in the draft Constitution, and not to give any Member State an edge."
"Your second comment, Mr President-in-Office, was that you want to move ahead swiftly."
"You want to report back in March and we fully support that aim."
"On this point, Mr Poettering, I agree with you for once."
"The rumours and prognostications about a two-tier or two-speed system, about centres of gravity and so forth must stop, and the best way to do that is by providing a European Constitution, and fast."
"Mr President-in-Office, you expressed your conviction that the European Union needs a Constitution."
"Obviously, we share that view."
"However, we do not need any old Constitution; we need the Convention’s proposed text."
"What is more, we need it now, not just in two or three years’ time."
"The world and the new challenges it brings is not going to wait for Europe."
"If I may, I would also like to address Mr Poettering."
"Mr Poettering, you called for the results of the elections to be taken into account when the next President of the Commission is appointed."
"I am very happy to hear you speak out so clearly in favour of a Commission President from the ranks of the social democrats."
"Mr President, the tone of the debate in this House is clear: most of us want to assist the Irish presidency to reach a quick settlement on the Constitution through our political contacts, and with our experience of these questions we can provide both practical and moral support."
"The scheduling of the work of the IGC is extremely important because, if it is scheduled and programmed properly, pressure will grow on the Member States to take more seriously their collective duty to provide leadership for the European Union."
"Why not pencil into the calendar an IGC summit meeting before 1 May?"
"The manner in which the new Commission President is chosen will serve as a further way of restoring political faith in Europe."
"This is a function of the presidency on which the Taoiseach was curiously discreet."
"How that person is chosen will be a factor in the fight to restore and strengthen the political authority of the Commission."
"It is not simply a question of finding a single candidate."
"All the party political groups should find their own champion, and the procedure provided for by the Convention could easily and simply be brought into early use by us all in June and July."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Irish Presidency faces a number of challenges."
"I shall highlight three, beginning with the negotiations of the financial perspective for the post-2006 period and proposals for the future of cohesion policy."
"The context in which these are to be tabled does not bode well for much-needed economic and social cohesion in the EU."
"Straightaway, we find ourselves, unacceptably, blackmailed by the so-called ‘Gang of Six’, which aims to limit the Community budget to 1% of the Community’s gross national product, following the lack of agreement at the Brussels Summit on the new Draft Constitutional Treaty."
"Given that the debate within the Commission currently fluctuates between maintaining the current limit of the financial perspective, 1.24% of Gross National Product, and reducing it to 1.15% – despite the accession of countries with revenues of less than 50% of the Community average, and despite the increase in social inequality and of national and regional disparities in the EU."
"There is a danger that the new financial perspective will undermine what ought to be urgent priorities, such as jobs with rights, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and cooperation and development with developing countries."
"The fundamental issue is, therefore, to increase the financial perspective."
"The second challenge I wish to highlight is the much-needed review of the Stability Pact, which has been shown to be out of step with economic and social reality."
"We all know that it is an instrument for which the criteria are stupid, which penalises economic growth, jobs and public investment, and which ought to be scrapped."
"Simply making it flexible will not solve the problem."
"Debate is ongoing regarding the evaluation of current economic and monetary policies, especially the introduction of the single currency and the over-valuation of the euro, while the current economic climate amply illustrates the structural shortcomings of the policy that has been pursued and the need for a root and branch review."
"It is also essential that we amend what is known as the Lisbon Strategy, in order to achieve high-quality public services and to foster effective social inclusion."
"Finally, with regard to the Intergovernmental Conference for revising the Treaties, my suggestion is that you ignore the current draft."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern, and his colleagues here today."
"The Irish presidency should not allow itself to be hijacked or bullied and pressurised into ensuring that an EU constitution is pushed through during its six-month term."
"Failure to reach a final agreement on the controversial Constitution will not mean failure for the Irish presidency – unless of course the government is foolish enough to give the impression that such an agreement could somehow be reached."
"You may believe that if the Constitution were adopted during the Irish presidency, it would have a better chance of success in an Irish referendum."
"That will not be the case since those concerned about the issues will not be swayed to support it simply because it was finalised during that presidency."
"As you yourself know, Taoiseach, those in Ireland who are critical of the EU are so mainly because of the military implications of this Constitution."
"If the Constitution is to become a priority, then some key issues must be addressed."
"These relate in particular to military aspects, including structured cooperation, but also to the issue of the Euratom Treaty, which clearly must come to an end, especially for a country which is anti-nuclear."
"Much more time is needed to address the Constitution and the monumental decisions it entails, and the more time allowed the better."
"This would also give ordinary people throughout the European Union time to lobby for referenda on this issue."
"It would be a terrible blow to the democratic process if the people of Europe were not asked their opinion on this matter."
"The privilege we have in Ireland should be extended to all Member States."
"Your party colleague, Mr Gerard Collins, was correct in saying that everything can continue under the existing rules."
"We were told that the Treaty of Nice was essential for enlargement."
"Now we are told it is insufficient."
"Let the Irish presidency be a constructive and positive one."
"Let the issues that really matter to the people take priority, such as the Irish Government's support for 100% debt cancellation for the world's poorest countries."
"This initiative has widespread support, so let us take this opportunity to push for its realisation."
"You briefly mentioned environmental issues and you should take this opportunity to ensure that all the outstanding complaints against Ireland in relation to breaches of EU law are addressed and resolved."
"On the issue of the EU-Russia summit, which you also mentioned, it is essential that the major issue of Chechnya be raised with the Russians."
"The issue of the arms embargo to China is also one of major concern to those worried about the arms trade."
"Regarding the Middle East, I would urge Minister Cowen, who is going there today, to raise the concerns of many Members of this Parliament."
"Members who have just returned from Palestine say that the situation there is absolutely appalling."
"The walls which have been built there completely defy any kind of international logic or law."
"Mr President, so, the Irish presidency is handed the political hot potato of the draft European Constitution."
"No doubt reconciling the egos of so many aged male leaders is going to prove quite a challenge; increasing public opposition to the Constitution will not help either."
"I simply do not know whether a deal is possible in the course of the next few months."
"However, it is clear from the Irish programme that with or without the Constitution, this presidency intends to pursue a deeply integrationist agenda."
"Yet more agencies are to be established, all without democratic accountability and all adding to remote, bureaucratic control."
"This new form of government simply does not work!"
"From the common fisheries policy to the Stability and Growth Pact, the whole system is mired in failure."
"Sadly, the Irish antidote to all this appears to be 'more of the same'."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, if I may make a personal comment, I should like to offer the Irish Presidency my very best wishes."
"We have in common much more than we might have imagined in the past, perhaps because a large part of the Europe present here today is of Italian or Irish extraction."
"In New York and America we took our chance to find peace and our daily bread, freedom and work."
"We had to go and look for it there and, moreover, Ireland and Italy also have to choose between Counter-Reformation papism, which still hangs over both our societies, and a Europe of freedoms and of political, civil and economic reform."
"That is what I wanted to recall and place in context."
"Be careful, Mr President-in-Office!"
"With the Vatican-inspired vetoes on research freedom, Europe is again threatened with losing an extremely dangerous amount of our countries’ culture, industry and civilisation."
"Very briefly, Mr President-in-Office: pay close attention to reform, which is now international; pay close attention – and I am also addressing the President of the Commission – to that community of democracies towards whom the European Union has shown itself to be either indifferent or blindly hostile."
"In Geneva – we shall talk about it again this afternoon – there is the Commission on Human Rights."
"Mr President-in-Office, President of the Commission, change your tack!"
"We are asking you to give a decisive speech on this issue, as we did with Mrs Bonino, as we also did a few days ago with a brilliant speech by Mr Cox at Sana’a in Yemen, with that charter and declaration of human rights drawn up by predominantly Arab countries, which I hope we will not have to go on taking forward for very long as a temporary measure with regard to the European Union and our own countries."
"My best wishes, then, but please choose the road towards a Europe of freedom and reform and not the one towards counter-reform and obscurantism!"
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we are delighted to welcome the Irish decision to endeavour to build a safer Europe, one which is ever closer to the citizens and which at last has its first constitution, the fruit of the Convention’s labours."
"You, Mr President-in-Office, will have our staunch support to reach these goals."
"Ireland has the task of bringing the good work of the Italian Presidency to a conclusion, as you pointed out this morning."
"Mr President of the Commission, for the coming term to be successful a major political problem needs to be settled: what will the role of the Community’s executive power be?"
"To answer this question we need to know what the President of the Commission intends to do."
"When, at the beginning of this year, you attacked the Italian Presidency, although you had praised it in your official speeches, you confirmed your intention of taking part yourself in the Italian election campaign."
"We should like you to give us some clarification, a clear answer to the vital question that Parliament is asking you: do you intend to continue as head of the executive, or have you decided to stand in the forthcoming European elections?"
"It is your duty to decide, as Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo have reminded you more than once."
"For this presidential term and the next, Europe needs a Commission with a full-time head."
"The Council and Parliament need a Commission that will perform its role as the promoter of legislative initiatives even more thoroughly than it has done up to now."
"The procedures for choosing commissioners from the enlargement countries, the opinion on Turkey, the submission of the Union’s financial perspective and the support you have announced for the signing of the constitutional treaty all require stability and a President whose commitments lie only in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office and Mr President, I am very pleased that the Taoiseach and his ministers are here today and that they hold the presidency of Europe at this particularly crucial time."
"Because of the failure to establish agreement on the new European Constitution during the previous presidency, their first main task is to reach that agreement."
"I hope they will, because there is a clear need for a long-term constitutional framework for the new Europe of 25 countries, which may well become even larger during this decade."
"The principles of the European Union have served us very well and must be preserved in the new Constitution: full representation of each Member State in all the institutions – institutions which respect our different identities, and where we can work together in our common interest."
"I am confident that the Irish presidency will work hard to secure an agreement capable of winning the support of all the peoples of the European Union, in which all citizens and all Member States have equal rights, there is no second-class membership and we all make progress together."
"A two-speed or a two-tier Europe will not succeed in meeting the aspirations of our peoples."
"Mr President-in-Office, the work you and your government have done, and are still doing, for peace in Northern Ireland is outstanding."
"The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution: the first half of the last century was the worst in the history of the world – 50 million dead."
"Who, then, could have dreamt that, in the second half of that century, those same peoples would unite?"
"The principles at the heart of the European Union can therefore solve conflict anywhere in the world because those three principles are also at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland."
"Accordingly, given our history of success in conflict resolution in Europe, would it not be a very good thing if, during the Irish presidency, you were to persuade the Commission to set up a special department of peace and reconciliation so that, instead of sending armies to areas of conflict, a team of people equipped with the European Union's philosophy and principles is dispatched to those areas, since today we are in a stronger position to shape the world?"
"Technology, telecommunications and transport have made the world a much smaller place."
"The European Union could therefore play a major role in ensuring there will be no conflict or war in the world."
"The way to do that is to transport the philosophy of the European Union to areas of conflict: dialogue developed there will enable agreement to be reached accordingly."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you face major challenges over the next six months, partly in connection with the constitutional Treaty."
"I have high hopes of you and would make a special proposal to which I believe that many European women, and not a few men, will attach importance."
"Shortly before the Intergovernmental Conference, the Italian Presidency came up with a proposal to add – and I quote – ‘the principle of equality between men and women’ to Article 2 of the constitutional Treaty."
"Equality between men and women is not merely a principle."
"It is, and must continue to be, a fundamental value in the EU, just as the other values – human dignity, democracy etc – are not merely principles but fundamental values."
"At the extraordinary meeting for previous Convention members, the Italian Foreign Ministers promised to take the following proposal further: after ‘equality’ in the first clause are to be added the words ‘including equality between men and women’."
"I shall produce the proposal for you, in writing and in English."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on fulfilling its responsibility with regard to judicially demanding compliance with the Stability Pact."
"Rules must apply equally to everybody, because otherwise we will not be able to say that we live within the Rule of Law."
"Nevertheless, I regret that certain members of the Commission have made statements referring to a two-speed Europe, that is, dividing Europe up just when we are about to reunify."
"That is not the way for the Commission to carry out one of its essential functions; guardian of the Treaties."
"And, incidentally, it is reasonable, in a democratic system, that the head of the executive power be asked to respond to a parliamentary majority."
"I would like to praise the Irish Presidency for the clarity with which it has given its opinion on a two-speed Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we expect a lot from the next six months and fully agree with the political priorities set and your commitment, which you have repeated this morning, to the European Constitution."
"We believe it is necessary to confront a process of reforms for the economic and social modernisation of the Union, to guarantee freedom, security and justice for the people who live or reside in it, and finally, to define more profound relations with the United States, in order to combat the new threats to our democracies and our fundamental rights more effectively."
"Ireland is a good example of what solidarity in the Union should be, and that solidarity is best expressed through our policy of economic and social cohesion."
"My country, Spain, also aspires to achieving real convergence with the European Union average because, according to our political philosophy, the aim is not to create permanently subsidised societies, but that our level of development must contribute to the internal economic balance of the Union."
"We wish the Irish Presidency every success over the coming months."
"Mr President, I also wish to welcome the President-in-Office."
"It is certainly nice to see the professionals back in charge of the shop."
"The real challenge for this presidency, of course, is to deliver enlargement, and the difficulties that remain should not be underestimated."
"The new countries must be pressured by this presidency to continue the reforms necessary for their successful integration into the Union."
"We must continue our clear commitment to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey to ensure that the enlargement process proceeds."
"Enlargement is challenge of the decade."
"It is not just a question of delivering enlargement, but also of making it work."
"Enlargement could make or break the European Union."
"Frankly, without a reform of our decision-making structures, enlargement will break the Union – it is as simple as that."
"Therefore, we must have a constitutional treaty."
"I fear that many colleagues here today have underestimated the vested interests there are in some governments not to have an agreement, at least for the time being."
"How else do you explain voting arrangements that do not come into effect until 2009 causing the collapse of the IGC?"
"It defies belief that was the only reason."
"The real tragedy of this debacle is that it is distracting us from even more important work."
"The Constitution is about how we do things, when our attention should be focused on what we do."
"Key to that is the Lisbon process, which is running out of steam, hamstrung as it is by a surfeit of generalities, a lack of specific targets, and by the Member States' failure to implement what they have agreed to."
"In particular, this presidency must take forward the report by Wim Kok."
"We must have more and better jobs; we must make work pay; we must have a more dynamic social model aimed at getting more people into work – particularly those traditionally excluded; we must avoid having a two-tier workforce and we need a more productive workforce."
"To do this we have to set every government clear targets to be achieved."
"The new Member States are used to annual scrutiny."
"We have to extend that discipline to the existing states."
"Let us do more to put countries on the spot."
"My question to the President-in-Office is very specific: how do you intend to take forward Wim Kok's very important report?"
"Because, more than anything else, if you deliver on more jobs you will earn the eternal gratitude of our voters."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council began his speech in his own language, Gaelic; you also did so, President Cox, at your investiture, as well as the President of Ireland."
"However, I cannot use mine, Catalan, spoken by more than seven million people, and the Catalan Government and Parliament cannot address the Court of Justice in Catalan on issues relating to the application of European Union law, which makes up 80% of our legislation."
"My request, therefore, since you have a particular understanding of what it means to defend the identity of a people and a country in Europe, is that the European Constitution, which you have committed yourself to promoting, should take account of the rights of these peoples, their languages, their cultures and also the constitutional regions."
"There are many references for it and many reasons to defend it."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in the six month period starting now, during which Ireland is taking over the Presidency of the Council, there are two important events: the historic unification of Europe with the accession of ten new countries on 1 May and the European elections next June in our twenty-five Member States."
"The events of the next six months will surely be dominated by the continuance of the Intergovernmental Conference, which is responsible for preparing a new constitution for Europe after the failure of the Brussels summit in December."
"It is clear that the European Union will be in a better position to welcome these new members if it already has a constitution."
"You were pragmatic, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, when you recently spoke out against the idea of setting a final deadline for reaching an agreement on the future constitutional treaty."
"However, you were also wise in warning against extending the IGC too much."
"Like you, I think that the longer the negotiations go on, the smaller the chances will be of reaching an agreement."
"I have therefore quite understood your desire to make every effort to encourage the decision-making process, because institutional confusion should not cause us to forget the historic event of the ten new Member States joining the EU, countries that have largely proved themselves worthy of joining a Community of value and freedom."
"Let us ensure that the indecision that we have been guilty of does not paralyse the entire European plan."
"In less than six months, the citizens of the united Europe will be called upon, in the European elections, to decide together on the future of our continent."
"Traditionally, and unfortunately, the electorate is not interested in this vote, because what is at stake seems to be too distant or obscure to them."
"I hope that the Irish Presidency and all the Member States of the EU will tackle this problem and try to mobilise citizens by organising a European debate giving them a real choice between the different options available to Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my first remarks are addressed to an absent colleague, which I am sure is due to his packed schedule."
"I actually wanted to respond to Mr Poettering."
"He is not in the Chamber at the moment, but he will undoubtedly hear what I have to say."
"In the course of today’s discussion about the Irish Presidency we have heard yet again from Mr Poettering, who always comes back to the same subject, namely the question of who will be the next Commission President."
"As far as he is concerned, it is obvious that the next Commission President will be proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"First of all, let me say that the European elections take place on 13 June."
"It is not up to Mr Poettering in plenary to determine which group will be strongest in this House after those elections, but rather it will be decided by European voters."
"We still intend to do a lot of campaigning."
"I am not certain that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be the strongest group in the House after the elections."
"It may be, Mr Poettering, that the unifying forces at work within this group will actually fail between now and then."
"I am thinking of the British Conservative Party, and others, who no longer want to sit in this group, but it may be that a couple more will join them."
"Maybe Mr Fini – we do not know."
"It is a dynamic process after all."
"Whoever becomes the next Commission President, however, will need broad support in this House and will only receive broad support in this House if he, or she, has the Group of the Party of European Socialists on his, or her, side."
"Our conservative colleagues would therefore be well advised to pursue an inclusive approach in the Chamber, rather than electioneering here."
"Allow me to make a further comment."
"This criticism applies to everyone who refers to the domestic political situation in a particular Member State."
"I am thinking of the previous presidency, which taught me a hard lesson."
"For the moment, however, let it be noted with no further comment that every MEP in this House exploits the office of the Commission President for domestic campaigning purposes."
"In my opinion, this is something that should be rejected vigorously in the interests of the European institutions."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would like to ask you the same question that I also put to your predecessor, and I hope we will not end up with flights of cinematographic fancy."
"What do you intend to do to ensure the rapid introduction of the European arrest warrant?"
"I put the same question to each presidency."
"If in your comments, you suggest that the Tampere process should be reviewed, then let me remind you once again that the European arrest warrant was a key component of the Tampere Conclusions and did not – despite the commitments made at Tampere – enter into force on 1 January."
"Let me repeat a point I made in our last debate: this is not the fault of one Member State, but rather the fault of many Member States."
"For this reason, then, I also ask you to be the President-in-Office who finally takes this issue seriously."
"Because if we want to implement Tampere, we need the European arrest warrant."
"I would be very grateful if you could come back to this point in your reply."
"– Mr President, last year was a miserable year for Europe, and the challenge is now to restore the confidence in the institutions and in the agreements that they have concluded."
"This confidence will also be reflected in the turnout for the European Parliament elections in June."
"One way of restoring this confidence is more transparency and democracy."
"We are looking for a new President of the Commission, and we are looking for an independent, energetic person with the backing of a majority in the new Parliament."
"I would therefore ask the President of the Council to consider involving Parliament in the nominations of candidates, by, for example, having the political families put forward names."
"We should in any event get away from back-room decisions taken in the middle of the night."
"Secondly, confidence can be restored by effective intervention in cross-border problems."
"This is what the public expect from us."
"Major epidemics are a case in point."
"The fact that SARS has passed us by during previous epidemic crises is more down to luck than good judgment."
"A new SARS epidemic is looming and I am asking the presidency to take the initiative to ensure that the Public Health Ministers grant the Commission – in this case, Commissioner Byrne – far-reaching powers to take crisis management measures, such as uniform controls at airports, should this prove necessary."
"In any case, I am confident that this presidency can restore confidence in the institutions, and your inspired speech of today only encourages me in this."
"– Mr President, I too am delighted that the Irish Presidency is prioritising the objective of reuniting the peoples of Europe, after divergences on key points of the Convention’s proposal led to its collapse in Brussels."
"The June elections must not be allowed to widen the split in the Union, but must instead give a new democratic boost to pro-European feeling."
"Parliament wants to get back on course towards a constitution straight away, and appreciates the commitment to reconvene the Intergovernmental Conference and to act transparently, for the sake of closer and closer relations between the Union’s institutions and its citizens."
"We also share the multilateral position for a common foreign and defence policy, for a solid partnership with the United States, for the reaffirmation of the United Nations and for the resumption of international trade talks."
"Public opinion is, however, concerned about the future."
"The spring Council will report the successes that have been achieved, but there is also the risk that the social model will be weakened without Europe’s economy becoming any more competitive in the world."
"We have to think carefully about the choices we need to make to relaunch the Lisbon strategy and also about the Union’s financial perspective: that is, the resources that Europe can call on to face the challenges that were clearly spelt out by Mr Prodi."
"– Mr President, Taoiseach, I urge you to tackle the language and culture of bureaucracy."
"Citizens' organisations despair when they read forms and subsidy applications in a Eurospeak that alienates citizens."
"All credit to the Irish Presidency for wanting to simplify forms, regulations and texts and make them citizen-friendly."
"The attack on this bureaucratic language and culture could consist of abolishing bureaucratic forms and replacing texts of regulations by modern, understandable and citizen-friendly text."
"Secondly, we could use an action network of national public organisations and national MPs as a contribution to the Irish conference in April in order to bring language and culture closer to the citizen."
"Thirdly, over the next few months, we ought to use TV commercials as a means of explaining, in straightforward language, to citizens in all European countries what the core message of Europe is: safety on the streets, global safety, protection of the environment, more democracy and less bureaucracy."
"Europe begins with the citizens in their own regions."
"Fourthly, we should support measures for proper governance."
"We need to bring down the number of pages of regulations from 80 000 to 50 000 and reduce the number of types of decisions from 23 to 6 in a bid to achieve clear, result-oriented and democratic governance."
"Accordingly, the European Constitution is of the highest priority and we should not get back to ‘business as usual’ until it is in place."
"The Heads of Government have failed in their negotiations on the Constitution in Brussels."
"Without a Constitution, it is not possible to conceive of any further enlargement and any serious discussion about the financial perspectives."
"Also, there is no scope for any further political integration as long as democratic control by the European Parliament is lacking."
"Fifthly, we should support Parliament’s proposals for a citizens' test of all those EU proposals that we will be receiving in the foreseeable future."
"In this case, prevention is better than cure."
"Sixthly, we should back Parliament's subsidiarity proposal."
"Let us keep low what can be kept low and small-scale what can be done on a small scale, with the national parliaments as watchdogs."
"These are our proposals in order to tackle a treacly bureaucratic Europe for the benefit of another, democratic Europe."
"Taoiseach Ahern, do you support this programme and will you do so in April?"
"For the rest, I would urge you to support the European Commission to maintain the rules at the Court, but also in the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to bring about more European growth despite the hard euro."
"I would ask you to support the proposals by Wim Kok, and support the proposals for debt relief coupled to the millennium objectives for developing countries."
"Do you intend to take an initiative on this score and do you support the troika for Ethiopia and Eritrea where another war is threatening to break out?"
"The Naples agreement is an important step along the way towards a broad European safety policy."
"All studies have shown that all our citizens regard this as a priority, so I would urge you to be ready to bring about the Convention's Constitution."
"Enlargement by the addition of ten countries in the absence of a Constitution is an insult to the European citizens, for they must be central in this year of rejoicing for Europe – and the way in which you have worded your work programme leads me to have complete confidence in you."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to wish the Irish Presidency luck and congratulate it on the slogan it has chosen, ‘Europeans – Working Together’, which is what we really need in order to confront the problems we are faced with."
"We must welcome the Irish Presidency’s active approach to the institutional confusion."
"Europe needs and wants a Constitution which reflects the aspirations of all the citizens of the European Union."
"It is clear, Mr President, that we must recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation."
"The Irish Presidency is very well situated, given the competitiveness the European Union requires, to take the path of the Lisbon Summit."
"At the same time, I believe it would be important – and it seems that the Presidency has not considered this – to schedule a debate on the financial perspectives which President Prodi announced this morning."
"It is clear that one problem we will have to face is the coherent decision taken by the Commission yesterday to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice as a result of the decision taken by the Ecofin Council."
"The European Union is a Community of law, and the rules only make sense if they are accompanied by the obligation for everybody, large and small, to comply with them."
"We are very pleased with the Presidency-in-Office of the Council’s assessment of the area of freedom, security and justice and the progress made since the Tampere Summit."
"We believe that it is also very well situated to confront relations between the European Union and United States, and in order to try to somehow transform the discord of the past into the harmony of the present and future."
"I would like to point out, because I believe it is significant, that yesterday saw the close of the Summit of the Americas – not in the best possible circumstances – and to say to the Presidency-in-Office that a very important area is being opened up allowing the European Union decisively to make this a priority for the next European Union/Latin America Summit of Heads of State or Government, in Mexico."
"I will end, Mr President, by regretting the fact that Mr Schulz is not with us."
"What the President, Mr Poettering, has said very clearly is that we must not proceed in a hurried fashion."
"There have been a series of premature candidatures."
"The ballot box will determine how majorities will be made up and it is clear that, in his proposal, the President of the Commission will have to take account of the results of the European elections."
"That is what this Parliament voted for."
"Our group is clearly the majority group and it is destined to continue to be so during the next legislature."
"– Mr President, Dear Taoiseach, there is an Irish saying to the effect that God invented whiskey in order to prevent the Irish from dominating the world."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Irish are serious Europeans, however."
"My political group saw this when we visited Dublin."
"You are going to tackle the EU’s real problems, quietly but with determination."
"After Mr Berlusconi’s clowning around and dubious jokes, it is comforting to have people at the helm of Europe who do not have swollen heads and have their feet firmly on the ground."
"Unfortunately, the reality of Europe is cruel."
"Growth has broken down in the Union."
"Unemployment is rising."
"European ambition is setting the pace, from the draft constitution to the Lisbon process."
"The necessary stability is set up as orthodoxy, while the United States are recovering growth through entirely unorthodox methods."
"One of your ministers, Dick Roche, compared the Lisbon process to some sort of Christmas tree on which the successive presidencies have hung their favourite decorations."
"This image perfectly illustrates the seasonal ritual that this major ambition from 2000 has become."
"The Irish Presidency is now proposing going back to basics."
"The spring summit should concentrate on the fundamental issues, growth and employment, which should become the EU’s prime ambitions."
"However, there is a nagging question still to be answered: where is the money, where are the budgets to give Europe the resources to fulfil its ambition?"
"The Union’s budget is negligible."
"It amounts to less than 1% of the gross European product."
"In 2003, the Commission did not even manage to spend these meagre funds."
"In order to fund the Union after 2006, the Commission will propose using the entire budgetary margin that is currently possible, that is, 1.24% of the gross European product."
"Even though six countries have already announced that they do not intend to increase their contribution, the Europe of the 25 will need more than a minimal level of solidarity if it is to develop."
"It would be a good idea for the Presidency to propose new own resources, for example a European tax on carbon dioxide emissions, or a tax at source on savings products rather than the bureaucratic system envisaged in Feira."
"A European tax of just one single cent per litre of fuel sold in Europe would fund the trans-European networks."
"That would create more growth while unburdening national budgets."
"Policy without financial resources is just an empty gesture."
"Bring Europe out of its rut, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, dare to do it!"
"Perhaps I could also say a few words about Mr Poettering’s speech."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants a Commission President from within its ranks."
"That is all very well."
"In that case, however, Mr Poettering needs to name names before the election."
"He cannot expect the citizens of Europe to buy a pig in a poke."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, an exciting six months lie ahead of you, with enlargement, the Constitution and the Spring Summit."
"However, I think there is more for you to do."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, you are going to have to decide what course to take with many policies and to shape the Council’s work."
"I hope that the Christmas period, the presidency handover and the start of a new year have been used as an opportunity to take stock, have given you insight, and that you are ready to move away from a veto-happy intergovernmental two-speed Europe towards a stronger community-focused Europe; from failure to respect Community law – notably the Stability and Growth Pact – to active implementation of Community rules and rulings – we welcome the Commission’s lawsuit; from the nationalisation of European policies towards more Europe-focused domestic policy; away from a culture of blaming the EU to a willingness to share responsibilities; from the end of the moratorium on human embryo research to an agreement on the limits; away from the system of dodging issues and procrastinating towards taking decisions about the directives on the agenda (I am thinking of the Transparency Directive, the Directive on competition in public services, the Takeovers Directive, President-in-Office); away from continuing the new populist debate on the Statute of Members to a decision."
"You still have 30 hours to reply to the European Parliament’s request for a timetable."
"Move away from the negative atmosphere that often prevails between the Council, Commission and Parliament towards establishing discussions and public relations which are citizen-friendly, optimistic, honest, which make use of the opportunities offered by enlargement, the Constitution, growth and employment, stability, the internal market, competition and subsidiarity."
"I ask you to make this about-turn, and in doing so, give our priorities a new direction."
"– Mr President-in-Office, I should first of all like to express my greatest respect for the difficult task that your Presidency has ahead of it."
"We all realise how difficult it will be to carry the Intergovernmental Conference through to a successful conclusion, given that it foundered in Brussels only a few weeks ago."
"Therefore, the message we should like you to pass on to all the governments in Europe is both simple and clear: accept the responsibility for giving Europe a constitution before the European elections."
"It is increasingly true that what we do is closely linked to how we function: you must strive to overcome the disputes that have led to this breakdown, for the sake of the greater good."
"The fact that the Convention succeeded in drawing up a constitutional text that was also widely supported by this Parliament shows that political and geographical differences are not an insurmountable obstacle."
"You must vigorously oppose the antihistorical conflict between national interests and Europe, because that is a disease that can rot away the strongest reasons for our staying together."
"One last question, Mr President-in-Office: in the concluding debate of the Italian term of office, Mr Berlusconi mentioned an agreement reached in the IGC on 85 points and an , which would leave just one point unsettled."
"Can you please tell us, Mr President-in-Office, what exactly the Italian Presidency has passed on to you?"
"I am asking because Parliament has so far been asking the Council about this in vain."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if I have understood the President-in-Office’s speech correctly, I think I perceive a vision behind it which allows us to preserve the momentum from the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I think we have to see whether there is indeed still a chance of reaching a decision before the European elections."
"It will be very difficult to sustain public awareness of what has been agreed by the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference thus far, but not been formally recorded, until December of this year."
"We have to be aware that if there is no Constitution, there will also be no Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Consequently, citizens will not be voting for the Commission President in the European elections, there will be no such mandate given and no participation for the national parliaments."
"Instead, a defence union will be formed outside the framework of the European Union, with all that entails for NATO, the transatlantic alliance and access for all European Member States of the European Union."
"I think that would put us back on track for creating a Europe of individual alliances, and gradually returning to the situation that existed in 1914."
"For this reason, Mr President-in-Office, I think you hold a great deal of responsibility."
"Whatever happens, we cannot allow the decision-making mechanisms in the Council to exceed the thresholds established at Nice."
"Indeed, we must stay below that threshold at all stages of the negotiations, because our ability to act must be preserved and cannot be allowed to end in a half-hearted compromise."
"We also need an appropriate balance between large and small states."
"I think that the large states of Spain and Poland, which are so important to the European Union, must be treated with proper consideration, but they must also be made aware that they share responsibility for ensuring that the European Union continues to develop."
"I trust your diplomatic skills will produce an appropriate response from these countries."
"Mr President-in-Office, there are two issues I would like to raise."
"Firstly, it is good to hear that the IGC has the highest priority for you."
"I am a bit puzzled by this, however, because you thanked the Italians for their good work but at the same time we understand from the press that you have not been given any notes or any indication as to where agreement was reached."
"At the same time the Italians flatter themselves that they reached agreement on 95% of the issues."
"If that is true, I urge you to find those notes in Brussels, finalise the 95% and use your time to make up the last 5%."
"I urge you to bear in mind that this not only involves consultation and reporting back in March, but will also require firm deadlines to be set for reconvening the summit in May, and a very hard line to be taken on this, otherwise there will be no chance of concluding the IGC before the elections."
"The other issue is the Statute for Members."
"Without a doubt, there will be a populist campaign against the statute over the next few weeks."
"The main argument will be that the salary is too high."
"It is high, I agree, but it is vital to remember the price paid for this salary: agreement on the travel expenses rules, which presently allow Members to pocket, tax-free, tens of thousands of euros a year under a very questionable system."
"We must be mindful of the link between the travel expenses rules and salary."
"I wish you the best of luck in your efforts."
"Mr President, I would like to wish the President-in-Office and his government colleagues every success during the Irish presidency."
"While I acknowledge that the Irish presidency has to tread sensitively in pursuing progress on the draft Constitution, I support Commissioner Prodi's warning that failure to reach agreement will inevitably lead to the creation of a two-speed Europe."
"If unanimous agreement on the Constitutional Treaty cannot be achieved, then the only alternative is the creation of a two-speed Europe."
"To do otherwise would be to give the power of veto to any eurosceptic Member State."
"A two-speed Europe already exists in at least two areas: namely the Schengen Agreement and the single currency."
"Schengen allowed for full implementation in the countries subscribing to the Single Act, especially as regards the free movement of persons."
"The decision by the United Kingdom and Ireland to opt out – although in our case this was for unavoidable reasons because of the UK position – did not prevent this from happening."
"Additionally, the decision by the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark to opt out of the single currency did not prevent its establishment, which, given the magnitude of the technical problems involved, was a massive achievement by the Commission."
"Its implementation was a momentous, historic development, representing the largest quantum leap towards political union."
"Given these experiences, we should not be alarmed at the prospect of taking similar decisions in other areas rather than face paralysis and stagnation at the hands of eurosceptic Member States."
"Fundamental to the dream of the founding fathers of our Union, 50 years ago, was the imperative to cede national sovereignty in exchange for the greater sovereignty of a united continent."
"The proposed Constitution is the fulfilment of that dream, to be pursued, if necessary, without those states where nationalistic chauvinism still rules."
"President-in-Office, your challenge is to ensure that the debate on the Constitution is concluded over the next six months; this is a difficult task, but let me wish you every success in this particularly historic task."
"– Mr President, Taoiseach, first let me say a few words about Lisbon before I go into the question of external relations."
"I agree with you and wish you well in your attempt to revitalise the Lisbon Agenda."
"At the same time, however, I think we need to be aware that Lisbon is not only about economic reform."
"It also involves investing more in training and further training for individuals."
"If we expect the European workforce to be more mobile, we must also provide them with a certain amount of stability and social security in return."
"This is the only way that people will be willing to contribute to the social side of this process of economic modernisation."
"Let me come on to the subject of external relations, however."
"My colleague Mr van den Berg has already referred to the critical situation in Ethiopia and Eritrea."
"We could add Kashmir, another place where the European Union is being asked to support what appears to be limited between India and Pakistan."
"However, I particularly want to focus on the Middle East."
"I think that it is up to your Presidency, Taoiseach, to seek to do more in order to ensure the European Union has a profile in the Middle East."
"Unfortunately over the last six months, a great number of opportunities in the area have been missed."
"In view of this, I would urge you to try everything in order for the association agreement with Syria, which is already almost ready to be signed, might still be concluded."
"I understand that the Commission has put in some very good work, but the Council or certain Council members have protested and vetoed it."
"Whatever the particulars may be, I think we need this kind of agreement with Syria so that we can put pressure on her to negotiate with Israel and to further the peace process."
"I think it is essential that we actually take advantage of the modest signs of an improved relationship between Israel and Syria."
"More generally speaking, however, rather than simply ignoring this trouble spot, the European Union needs to do more on both sides to drive the peace process forward."
"Just a little while ago, we did see the Geneva plan, which also caused a certain amount of positive unease in Israel because those in favour of peace now also have something on which to build."
"To close, let me also add that in a long, very inflammatory piece for newspaper, the former Israeli ambassador to Germany, Avi Primor, called upon the European Union to do more to establish peace in Palestine and Israel."
"I also ask you, Taoiseach, to do more to involve the European Union in this very important peace process."
"– Mr President, the Irish Presidency marks the start of a new, more liberal period after the South European presidential term."
"The northernmost Member States have been genuinely in favour of both the Internal Market and enlargement."
"Sometimes it seems that the further we move away from the EU’s heartland towards its geographical outer periphery the more sincere the Community spirit and greater the imagination for building a common Europe."
"Promoting economic growth and keeping on top of the Lisbon Agenda will be the most important issues during Ireland’s presidential term."
"Year in year out, the European Union continues to lag far behind the United States of America."
"America’s figure for growth in GNP for this year is very much in a class of is own: 3.9%."
"The objectives of the Lisbon Agenda are slipping away and I believe that the entire strategy for competition is petering out."
"All the projects agreed at EU level are ready, but the Member States have still not internalised the need for the structural changes the strategy calls for."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is beginning to creak."
"It is especially important to enhance the work of the Competitiveness Council."
"It must become more active, taking greater responsibility for the basic question that has been put to it: what is each legislative project’s impact on EU competitiveness?"
"For example, how significant will the EU chemicals package and the reappraisal of Kyoto be for EU competitiveness?"
"With these projects the EU is very much in danger of sawing off the branch it is sitting on and risking its competitiveness and prosperity."
"If the country holding the presidency had difficulties finding points to get to grips with in the Competitiveness Council earlier on, here they are now on a plate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have rightly placed emphasis on meeting the expectations of our peoples."
"I can tell you that the people of Essex and other parts of the east of England that I represent would like less interference in their lives by the European Union."
"They want to run their own affairs."
"Our businesses want to sharpen their ability to compete in global markets, not to be weighed down by unnecessary red tape and socialist regulation, much of which originates in Brussels and is then gold plated by our own Labour Government."
"In particular they want a fair crack of the whip."
"The one aspect of the European Union for which there is any enthusiasm is the single market, but British farmers and businessmen have always suspected that the odds were deliberately stacked against them because certain Member States simply ignored the rules."
"Now the Commission has confirmed that suspicion with its announcement on Monday that France, Belgium and Germany, those great EU enthusiasts, are bottom of the league for implementing internal market rules, and France tops the list of infringement cases."
"I think immediately of the long-running and illegal ban on British beef."
"You said you wanted to focus on the Lisbon Agenda."
"To give yourself a bit of breathing space, I suggest that the first thing you should do is kick the proposed Constitution firmly into touch."
"The notion that the Constitution was essential for an enlarged Union is clearly a myth. It was just a vehicle for further political integration and that is something that our citizens simply do not want."
"Similarly, they do not want European Union involvement in military matters, complicating and duplicating Nato and creating additional tensions with our vital transatlantic allies."
"The reality is that defence budgets are being slashed across continental Europe and even the superb British armed forces are desperately overstretched and under-equipped."
"European Union politicians playing bureaucratic games in Brussels will not help this situation."
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office, you rightly emphasise your intention to focus on practical human rights issues."
"One of the first decisions you will need to push through Council is the renewal of targeted sanctions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe."
"I would ask you to respond to Parliament's demands on this matter."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today you have unambiguously declared yourself in favour of multilateralism."
"You have called for the United Nations to be strengthened and mentioned the UN General Secretary’s visit to the European Parliament, which is scheduled for the end of the month."
"I do not think many presidents-in-office have begun by speaking out so clearly in favour of multilateralism and the United Nations in this House."
"Moreover, I believe that the challenges we will be discussing in great detail over the coming weeks – international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, disintegrating states, drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings – are too much for even the world’s strongest nation to tackle alone."
"It is multilateral solutions we need."
"Mr President-in-Office, I think this is another reason why we need the Constitution, however."
"The European Union is not ready to put up a united front against the United Nations system."
"There are too many stakeholders."
"The European Union is a member of the FAO, with a seat and a vote."
"As yet the European Union has no legal status in external relations."
"We have a Commission office in New York."
"We have a Council office in New York."
"We need this Constitution to enable the European Union to obtain this legal status and act in this sphere as well."
"Consequently, both for the purposes of external relations and in terms of working within the United Nations system, where the European Union is the greatest contributor, we need to increase our political influence and express our political strength together."
"That is why we need to have a Constitution very soon, and I ask you to take that into account during your consultations."
"If Europe wants influence, there is no place for division."
"The only way is to act as a community, and your declaration in favour of multilateralism is a very significant starting point."
"– Mr President-in-Office, practically all the Members have expressed this Parliament’s hopes that you will succeed in bringing this extraordinary task – the Intergovernmental Conference and the constitution – to a successful conclusion."
"Good luck, we are right behind you!"
"Together with these extraordinary tasks, however, you will also have ordinary tasks to deal with, to which I should like to draw your attention."
"I shall just mention the main headings: the first is research, which was brought up again by Mr Prodi and which we all agree on."
"There is also, however, an ethical component in the financing of such research – my colleague Mr Liese will be speaking about it – and we should like you to give us your response on this, leaving aside the woolly obscurantism that Mr Pannella mentioned, which does not actually exist."
"There are two other issues dear to my heart that I should like to bring to your attention: air transport safety and air passengers’ rights."
"Unfortunately it took the tragedy of Sharm el-Sheikh to show just how strongly the public feels about this and how much we need to finalise a measure that has been inexplicably stuck in the Council since October last year."
"Just as inexplicably stuck, Mr President-in-Office, is a measure that this Parliament approved by an overwhelming majority: greater protection for air passengers if they are denied boarding or in the event of cancellations or delays."
"One government – the German Government – has inexplicably changed its mind, perhaps because it is more sensitive to Lufthansa’s arguments than to the passengers’."
"I am aware that your government, Mr President-in-Office, was opposed to this measure, but I cannot criticise that because you have always held a consistent position;"
"I am referring instead to those strange, last-minute changes of mind."
"I am sure that, in your new garb as President-in-Office of the Council, you will be able to further these measures and bring them to a conclusion, because they are in the interests of the European public and our fellow citizens are awaiting them."
"Mr President, I now raise a different point for the Taoiseach."
"I want to follow the theme that he raised on safety, particularly with relation to health and consumer policies."
"First, Taoiseach, I look forward to working with Minister Martin on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which is crucially important at a time of global disease threats and the threat of bioterrorism."
"Second, I look forward to working with your presidency on the implementation of patient mobility."
"Sadly, in the United Kingdom, as a result of the failure of the British Government's health policies, hundreds of thousands of people are waiting unacceptably long times for operations and treatments."
"This measure will give them some new hope of earlier treatment."
"Third, in your speech you referred to people in Sub-Saharan Africa: 30 million with HIV/AIDS, and 291 million living below the poverty line."
"I remind you of the inextricable link between health and poverty and urge you to ensure renewed momentum on health and clean water policies, and on debt relief."
"Fourth, Taoiseach, allow me take you down a long lane in the county of Meath, to a small business situated there which is known as the Food and Veterinary Office."
"That office controls and inspects the food, feed, animal welfare and plant health of the European Union: of Member States, Accession States and countries across the world from French Polynesia to the Falklands."
"It is fundamental to the health and safety of our people."
"It has just 90 inspectors covering the globe and I ask the presidency to look carefully at that to see how this corner of Ireland, with its EU-wide implications, can be made more effective."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with all those who have said that the Irish Presidency’s most important task is to secure the adoption of a Constitution which is as close as possible to the Convention proposal."
"I believe that in December we explicitly agreed to ask you to produce a consolidated text."
"Enlargement and the elections are both scheduled for this year, and both will suffer if we do not begin them with a clear message on this subject."
"Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned research policy, which is a very important subject."
"We have to do more on this front, especially in comparison to the United States."
"The disparity is particularly striking in the fields of biotechnology and medicine."
"In the US, NIHs (National Institutes of Health) receive USD 28 billion every year for medical and biotechnology research."
"The EU is spending EUR 2.25 billion over four years under the Sixth Framework Programme, and even adding in everything done in the Member States, the figures are a great deal lower."
"This is the main reason why young medics and researchers are still migrating to the United States."
"That said, we do also need a clear ethical framework for research, and I know that within your own country, as in the European Parliament, opinions vary: on the question of whether the European Union should support research on human embryos, for example."
"Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on the subject under the Italian Presidency."
"Commissioner Busquin’s behaviour was also somewhat ambiguous."
"I think it is now up to you to pick up the ball and run with it."
"It is your responsibility to work with your Minister for Research and devise a solution that is acceptable to all sides."
"We cannot allow this matter to be resolved behind closed doors under the comitology procedure."
"The political responsibility lies with the Council of Ministers, and I call on you to respect this."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, speaking as a Swedish Conservative, I welcome the Irish Presidency."
"It is a new European Union that, in six months’ time, you will hand over to the next country to hold the Presidency."
"With enlargement occurring during your Presidency, the EU will increase in importance and its words will count for more."
"Ireland has great confidence in the work for peace."
"You took the initiative, helped find a solution to the protracted internal conflict in Ireland and helped normalise the situation there."
"In spite of what was said at the last EU-Russia summit, I now appeal to you and the Irish Presidency to make use of the confidence you enjoy and to exploit the European Union’s growing importance by taking the initiative to promote a genuine peace dialogue between the parties involved in the war in Chechnya with a view to bringing the atrocities to an end."
"The war in Chechnya is a focus for the spread of terrorism."
"It is an abomination for both Russia and Europe, and the war may have far-reaching consequences for peace in our part of the world."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what you can bring about in terms of peace and freedom in Europe will be greeted with endless gratitude on the part of the peoples of the European Union."
". Mr President, I shall try to respond to a number of issues as quickly as I can."
"I should like to thank the honourable Members for their comments on the Irish presidency programme, and for their support and good wishes for the success of the Irish presidency."
"I have listened closely to the speeches by over 40 Members in today's debate and they confirm my belief not only that this is a challenging time for the Union, but also that if Member States and the institutions work together it ought to be a time of great opportunity for the Union."
"Our presidency focus, as far as internal policies are concerned, will be to advance work on a range of fronts and make life better for the citizens of Europe; as many of you pointed out, that is what we should be doing."
"We will be unstinting in our efforts to make progress on a new constitutional treaty."
"Perhaps I will come back to that at the end of my speech."
"If we feel that there is a real prospect of agreement, we will spare no effort to facilitate the earliest possible agreement, and the support of Parliament will be of particular importance."
"I have a few remarks on what Members have said."
"We welcome the new Member States to the Union."
"We look forward to completing our work with President Prodi by 1 May, and I hope the success of the wider enlargement process will be carried forward as well."
"We are continuing to press ahead with the necessary reforms to make the European economy more competitive and capable of providing more and better jobs."
"We will also be working to ensure a safer Europe that will carry forward the Union's agenda in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I went into that in some detail at the outset."
"I have noted carefully the many points raised by Members and I would like to thank my Irish colleagues in particular for the important points they raised."
"I greatly appreciate the opportunity this occasion has allowed me to ensure that the presidency is made aware of issues and concerns. I can assure you that we will reflect on all of them as we take our presidency work forward."
"My colleague, Mr Roche, will be talking about human rights later on and he will also be taking some of the questions on issues that have been raised today."
"I would like to reflect on the advice given to me by many of the leaders of the Groups at the outset."
"I have carefully noted what was said – not necessarily in order or by whom, though that has also been noted elsewhere."
"However, they should all recognise their own words."
"They said that we should insist on mutual respect, restore belief, build solidarity, tell the truth and act in unity."
"I shall try to do all of that to the very best of my ability."
"I want to put on record today that these are values that we share and that we will gear our presidency towards values that are not only important in themselves and fundamental to the vision of Europe, but also essential to the successful functioning of the Union."
"We might not always succeed in meeting the high standards we have set ourselves, but I want to pledge to you that these values respect, belief, solidarity, honesty and unity are good values, and I certainly will remember them and repeat them to my colleagues, who will be speaking here over the next six months."
"I want to thank President Prodi for his promise of support for the presidency."
"I can say that, as far as we are concerned, the work of President Prodi and his colleagues in preparing for the presidency over many months has been extremely important to us."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for that."
"Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Poettering and others raised the issue of the appointment of the new President of the Commission."
"I have carefully noted all their comments and can assure you that the views of Parliament will be borne firmly in mind."
"This is only the 14th day of the Irish presidency, but already one thing of which I am certain is that I will not be short of advice on that particular appointment."
"I would like to thank everyone for that."
"Mr Watson recalled that one Irish writer once wrote that 'history is a nightmare from which we are trying to awake'."
"I should like to recall a phrase about history from the most recent Irish Nobel Prize winner for literature, Seamus Heaney."
"Working together during the Irish presidency and beyond, Parliament, the Council and the Commission 'can look forward to a time when hope and history rhyme'."
"I fully agree with Mr Watson on the importance of restoring belief in the Union and its potentials."
"We will work with Parliament to achieve those potentials over the next six months."
"Mr Bonde referred to the position of small countries in the European Union."
"I am delighted, in that regard, to appear before you at a time when both the President of Parliament and the President of the Council come from small countries."
"My colleague, Mr Collins, said that failure by Europe, including the IGC, cannot be countenanced."
"The next time the European Council is called upon to agree a constitution for Europe it is essential for there to be a successful outcome."
"We have now embarked upon that process of consultation and assessment and my dearest wish is to bring the IGC to a successful conclusion."
"Let me assure Parliament once again that the Irish presidency will spare no effort in trying to facilitate a consensus."
"I would like to thank Mr Paisley for his genuine and warm if slightly conditional welcome."
"I have some bad news for him, in that I have learnt a bit from him over the years."
"I have always greatly admired him and told him as much on the one occasion we met."
"He has managed very successfully to combine membership of the Assembly at Westminster with membership of the European Parliament, so it should be possible for me to do my job at home and be here at the same time, to help you out as best I can."
"I genuinely admire Mr Paisley and respect the mandate he has received."
"It would be very unfair if I did not acknowledge that."
"He made a strong point about democracy in Europe, saying that when we draw up constitutions we should put them to the people to secure a popular mandate."
"He stressed that point several times in his contribution."
"All I can say in reply is that we always do that in the Republic."
"That is obviously a further reason why he feels so dearly about my country."
"Mr Wurtz and Mr Collins, in particular, emphasised the need for the Union to actively promote progress in the Middle East, through implementation of the roadmap."
"Parliament can rely on the Irish presidency to do precisely that."
"The Union will continue, during our presidency, to express serious concern at the building of the so-called 'security fence'."
"The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his presidency capacity, will be in the Middle East tonight, engaged in discussions."
"I have noted what was said by Mr Poettering, Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit and others about Chechnya."
"Again, these are issues that we will be addressing."
"I was asked very particularly by Mr Schulz about the European arrest warrant."
"I should like to make it clear that during its presidency, Ireland will arrange meetings to review the current state of implementation of the arrest warrant across the European Union and issues related to this."
"Ireland, along with seven other countries has in fact been in a position to put the European arrest warrant into operation since 1 January 2004."
"We must now try to complete the process."
"The human rights situation in many parts of Africa will continue to give cause for concern and will receive our continued attention."
"Indeed, this presidency will work for a greater commitment to conflict prevention in Africa."
"There are many facets to this since the causes of conflict in Africa and elsewhere are diverse."
"The recent agreement in the Council on the African peace facility is an important step forward in Europe's engagement with that continent."
"We will assist in the development of African peacekeeping capabilities and this presidency will press for early EU action on implementing the commitments made by Member States, with a view to meeting the millennium goals."
"I noted when looking at tomorrow's draft agenda that a joint motion for a resolution on the assassination of Archbishop Courtney, an Irishman, is to be considered."
"I would like to thank Parliament for according attention to this matter."
"He was a man who worked hard in many countries but in his latest role, as Papal Nuncio to Burundi, he really believed in the peace process there."
"I want to thank you for remembering him in the European Parliament."
"A number of Members have raised the issue of debt relief."
"I think you know what the Irish position is on that; but, to reiterate, the Irish presidency position is that the European Union has been an enormously generous donor for debt relief purposes. It has contributed over USD 900 million to the World Bank Trust Fund for debt relief."
"In addition, the Commission is committed to writing off bilateral debts owed to it by countries qualifying for debt relief."
"This is a considerable success and we will use whatever opportunities arise during our presidency to promote debt relief."
"We have a particular position, and accordingly we can do many things."
"I should like to move quickly on to the issue of human rights, because many speakers and all the leaders mentioned it, and many Members made strong and moving pleas for Europe to place human rights at the centre of its external policies."
"This plea resonates strongly with the presidency because the presidency has made effective promotion of human rights a central objective."
"We shall make every effort to move forward the human rights agenda across the broad range of the Union's external policy, including the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"As I said, my colleague Mr Roche will be making a statement later today on behalf of the presidency."
"I was asked by a number of speakers to be precise about the Lisbon Strategy."
"I shall say three things about that strategy."
"Clearly, because of the economic situation in Europe and elsewhere in the world, progress on implementing the strategy has not been possible to the extent hoped for by António Guterres four years ago when he was here."
"Each year, we have tried to highlight issues and highlight what we need to do in Europe."
"The Irish presidency is determined to focus on the implementation of the core objectives of sustainable growth and employment: they are the two issues we have singled out from what is admittedly a long list."
"This is not to say that we should have employment and growth at any cost."
"We are not saying that."
"Such an approach would be both short-sighted and counterproductive."
"To those Members who mentioned social inclusion, I say that this is one of the issues dear to my heart that we are not in any way sacrificing."
"We are committed to policies that decouple growth and the use of resources, and to the European social model. I am very committed to the European social model."
"I am reminded that the Social Charter was brought in 14 years ago when I was President of the Social Affairs Council."
"We have provided continual follow-up since then, with a successful outcome."
"The second point I want to make is that the report by Wim Kok is in my view excellent."
"He focuses on four specific areas to which we are committed."
"Many conference seminars and initiatives are taking place, not only in Ireland, but elsewhere in Europe, other Member States having established a tripartite social conference with the social partners – employers and trade unions – to try to build on the Wim Kok report."
"We shall do our best to implement it."
"I shall say a final few words."
"Everyone except two speakers spoke on the IGC. The two who did not spoke on the Food and Veterinary Office in Meath, which I opened."
"I very much take to heart what you said."
"Food safety is an enormously important issue today, and that objective will be pursued by our ministerial colleague Mr Martin."
"Everyone else spoke on the European Convention."
"Admittedly, a minority of those who spoke would like me to forget about it altogether, but about 95% took the opposing view."
"The reason I am not overstating what the Irish presidency can do is that I cannot carry this through alone."
"I do not want to come back to the newly elected Parliament in July and make excuses about not having achieved X, Y or Z."
"I am fully committed to trying to finalise the constitution."
"I will do all I can to finalise it."
"I will follow the mandate given to me by the European Council, which is to consult, make an assessment and report back in March."
"If we can move on from that to an IGC, I will act accordingly; if I believe that it is not possible to reach a consensus, I will not, because I think a second failure will only make life more difficult for the future."
"I passionately believe that making progress in the shorter term would be better and safer."
"I share that view with both the President of Parliament and Mr Prodi."
"We need the help of Parliament."
"We need the help of Member States, and of the European Council, so that people shift their positions."
"The facts are simple."
"I said to the leaders in Dublin on 19 December that if all parties maintain their present positions there is no hope that I can bring this matter to a conclusion."
"I do not want to mention any particular country because it is not fair to do so and matters are not so simple."
"I did not say in my opening remarks, contrary to what was picked up by some, that the work of the Italian presidency in connection with the Brussels summit was not useful."
"It is pointless for me to go back to compromises that were never on the table."
"The work done by the European Convention last summer, which you can all rightly feel proud of, and the post-Naples work concluded towards the end of November and in early December represents the initial position of the Irish presidency."
"On other issues agreement has not yet been reached, so that will be our starting point."
"I urge Parliament to do whatever it can, and provide whatever support it can give, to prompt people to take decisions sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, I say to you and to President Prodi that, otherwise, that there will be a new presidency – which is not a problem, as presidencies come and go – but there will also be a new Parliament, a new Commission and a new set of circumstances."
"Many of the individuals who negotiated the Convention may or may not be around to continue the process."
"People are at least clear about many of the issues on which agreement has almost been reached, if not in full; in a year's time they will not be so clear."
"It will be far more difficult to finalise the Constitution."
"I will do my best;"
"I cannot do it on my own."
"If we work together – Parliament, the Commission and the Irish presidency – and try to get people to shift their positions sooner rather than later, we can complete this task."
"If we do not, it will become a long, drawn-out issue."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the speech Bertie has made makes my job much easier, because the Presidency and the Commission are in complete agreement."
"The Dublin meeting laid the foundations for close cooperation and the essential points he has put forward are shared by the Commission."
"In the very few minutes available to me I should like to recall a number of aspects that are of the greatest political significance: first, an appeal for a general effort to support political pluralism."
"The speech made about the United Nations and the role it should have and the urgent call for human rights must be the basis for our future work; on this we agree."
"It was also extremely important to mention the strong, positive relationship between the United States and Europe, and it is interesting that the whole of Parliament accepted that, while adding that the relationship should be on an equal footing."
"Remember, however, that an equal footing is not something that is given lightly: we can only gain an equal footing if we succeed in building a strong Europe that can make decisions, a Europe that is truly able to negotiate on an equal footing."
"This is the task that we, together with the Irish Presidency, must carry forward."
"With regard to enlargement, and in response to several Members’ queries, I can assure Parliament that we are moving with the utmost speed on the appointment of the new Commissioners. I repeat, by the end of February, after I have been round all the capitals and shortlisted all the Commissioners, I will bring you their names here."
"You must be aware that these Commissioners – you are well aware of this – will only be here for a few months because after that they will have to be nominated. I have, however, asked the Heads of State or Government of the new Member States to put forward the names of strong candidates, people who will be able to stay on, so that there can be continuity in political action, so that the continuity of the Commissioners that they nominate can make up for the fact that these countries are only now joining the Union."
"In answer to Mr Poettering, you will be able to see the political balance as well as the personal abilities of these new Commissioners during their interviews."
"I can assure you that the results so far have been quite flattering: the governments of the various states have been sending us people who have held or still hold the highest political offices in their countries."
"I believe this will also be imitated by the current Member States when the time comes to nominate their new Commissioners, because the Commission is becoming an increasingly political body with ever greater political responsibilities."
"On the subject of the constitution, there has been a widespread call that we have to acknowledge: Convention, Convention, Convention!"
"Any attempt to move in a different direction is doomed to failure, doomed to produce no results, and I believe the way in which Bertie Ahern has approached this challenge is the best we can hope for and is the most likely to succeed."
"We are all too aware, Mr President, that no success is assured and that the situation is difficult but, by looking carefully at our current difficulties and the great result that the Commission has given us, we will surely get good results."
"Lastly, I should like to mention the matter of Lisbon."
"I take on board Mr Doyle’s impassioned appeal, when he put his finger on the spot and quite rightly said that we have talked a lot about Lisbon but achieved very little."
"Unfortunately, this is true."
"We have been talking about Lisbon now for four years, and so, once again, I am going to make appeal: let us direct every possible effort towards human resources."
"We need human resources at all levels: at a national level in compulsory and university education, and at European Union level in top-level research."
"We need a joint effort."
"We cannot achieve the results outlined in Lisbon when we realise that 400 000 European researchers are currently working in the United States – I repeat, 400 000 European researchers are currently working in the United States – and when we realise that, if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, we will have to raise the number of our researchers by 700 000 over ten years, or we shall not achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"The most competitive society in the world does not come about all by itself, as you are well aware, and here we come up against a serious contradiction."
"On several occasions – in my speech a moment ago and at other times – I have proposed that major laboratories should be set up; we have even included this item in the financial perspective; we have also talked about the European Science Foundation to be able to coordinate cutting-edge research, for otherwise this research will not achieve the results we want."
"It is quite clear that we really have to do this, but we cannot do it when letters arrive proposing cuts in the European budget, as if money spent at a European level were money down the drain, as if this money did not in fact achieve greater synergies and have a greater effect on development than money spent at a national level."
"Until we get rid of this idea, and of course choose the fields in which money spent in Europe is most effective – although there is no doubt at all that research is an area where it is most effective – we shall not be able to have a truly great Europe."
"Lastly, a final observation on the Stability and Growth Pact: Mr Cohn-Bendit, with his forceful and youthful vehemence"
"– or rather, with his forceful and formerly youthful vehemence – made a speech on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and criticised the Commission for its decision."
"I must tell you all that this was a painful decision that I found difficult to make."
"I am well aware that making decisions like this one has its consequences."
"I had to make it for a simple reason: rules have to be obeyed, even if it does not make me happy to do so."
"This is a democratic principle, and so it was the Commission’s duty to call for the rule to be obeyed, but at the same time it has also been the Commission’s duty to prepare the changes needed for the future."
"I have very often been generous in this direction, ladies and gentlemen – perhaps too much so – but the finance ministers have never given me any leeway in the matter."
"I therefore call on you to help the Commission – or rather I call on us to help each other – to submit proposals that can truly bring new development and new energy to Europe’s economic policy."
"That concludes the debate."
". I wish to draw the attention of the presidency to the Euratom Treaty."
"This Treaty has been part of the EC since 1957."
"After 50 years this Treaty promoting nuclear energy is obsolete."
"However it, together with any new constitutional treaty, will be the Treaty of the EU."
"Many citizens will not accept this as the constitution of the EU and if referenda are held, as they must be in some states, I believe there will be no majority for a constitution promoting nuclear technology."
"I would like to thank you particularly Mr Ahern, President-in-Office of the Council, for joining with Austria and proposing a new convention on Euratom to review this treaty."
"I wish you success, as I am sure that the future of this new constitution depends on this happening."
"I regret that the Convention avoided this issue, and particularly regret that the delegate from the Verts/ALE Group, Johannes Voggenhuber, neglected to make progress on it, being drawn instead by a grand design for a new constitution."
"However, it is not too late: Austria and Ireland have led the way where others must follow."
". The Irish presidency, viewed from a Scottish point of view, demonstrates very clearly why Scotland would be better off independent."
"Ireland, a smaller country than Scotland, will be setting the agenda and leading the EU decision-making process, while Scotland does not even have a vote in the Council of Ministers."
"Ireland will lead the process of welcoming ten new member states – many smaller than Scotland – into the EU."
"These new members will have full rights of participation including votes on Fisheries Policy, while Scotland is a mere observer."
"I wish Ireland success in its presidency and look forward to the day when an independent Scotland takes its rightful place in the world – better off independent!"
"I do not know whether Sir Robert Atkins wishes to make his traditional point – which I would fully support – at this juncture, but if so he may!"
"– Mr President, since you invite me – and I have been provoked by colleagues – what is the point in running an assembly which indicates that votes are due to take place at 12 noon, but which then start at 12.40 p.m.?"
"Surely we should be able to manage our affairs efficiently."
"Would you please carry that concern back to the Presidency of Parliament."
"I will do that."
"The next item is the vote."
". Mr President, given the complexity of the case and its very political nature, I will ask for a break between the vote on all of the amendments and articles and the final vote."
"The Rules of Procedure allow for this."
"We will deal with the amendments and then deal with the other reports so you have time to consider the outcome."
". Mr President, I propose that the Socialist Party modifies its terminology in order to be consistent with a previous vote on legal framework."
"I propose substituting legal framework for framework directive in order to be consistent with the previous vote and in order to give the chance of a positive vote in favour of the text of the constitutional treaty."
". – Mr President, on this issue of the liberalisation of the water market, we have a contradiction in the French text."
"The French version is written in such a way that it seems that Amendment No 48 says that the water market needs to be liberalised without taking into account regional characteristics, while the English version says the opposite."
"I would like to point out that we worked first of all in English."
"Those who wish to reject the liberalisation of the water market therefore vote for the original text, if they do not accept Amendment No 103."
"They first have to vote on Amendment No 103, which rejects the liberalisation of the water market, and if Amendment No 103 is not passed, there remains the original text of Amendment No 48, the first part of which also rejects liberalisation."
"The services have noted the discrepancy and I can confirm that the English version is correct."
"– Mr President, now that we have voted on all the amendments to item 51, I would like to return to Amendment No 36."
"Our group has asked that this be voted on in two parts; we have just voted only on the first."
"I therefore ask you to proceed with the vote on the second half of Amendment No 36, in accordance with the request that we submitted."
"The services are checking on that, but I have not received any request for a split vote."
"Bono will be pleased."
"– Mr President, I rise to ask again whether you have finished checking the split vote on Amendment No 36."
"You were going to check it and announce the result."
"My group asked for a separate vote on Amendment No 36."
"You have voted only on the first part."
"I would like you to vote on Part 2 now."
"I did not put Part I to the vote."
"I put 36 to the vote."
"I have received no request for a split vote."
"We have voted on 36."
"Every other group has one vote, but the PPE-DE Group seems to have two votes on this."
"We will now wait with the vote on the motion for a resolution for a short time unless there are any objections."
"Mr President, as we seem to be having a bit of a breather, I should like to ask Mr Corbett whether he feels that the voting procedure we have undertaken is in conformity with the new Rules of Procedure we drew up for this House to try and simplify voting."
"The amendments relating to Mr Nobilia's report, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, were voted in blocks."
"However, we are now having a very contentious, long vote on a report drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I believe is not in conformity with the Rules of Procedure."
"Now you are asking us to delay the final vote."
"Under which Rule are you doing that, Mr President?"
"There are provisions in the Rules of Procedure for a delay."
"That is why I asked if there were any objections."
"I will not give the floor to Mr Corbett because I will not have him chairing the plenary from the floor."
"Of course we have complied with the Rules of Procedure, otherwise I would not have proceeded."
". Mr President, this report arose from a petition to the European Parliament signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe."
"The organisation which organised that petition, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, is represented in the gallery today and I want to thank it very much for the effort it has put in to bringing this issue before the House."
"– Mr President, we are not being difficult about the final vote on Mr Herzog’s report, but I do ask you to have the vote now, because many Members are already leaving."
"– Mr President, with all respect to Mr Poettering, who wants his lunch, this is so complicated that we can vote on the other amendments first and then let Mr Herzog say what he has to say."
"I regard these tactics as unworthy of a parliament."
"If you have difficulties, people get the idea that ..."
"Well, life is like that!"
"We will carry on debating until he has given his opinion."
"That is how it is?"
"Do you not have anything else to say?"
"Well, you should!"
"Colleagues, the Rules of Procedure are clear."
"The rapporteur is entitled to ask for a delay unless there are objections."
"As there now clearly are objections, I shall give the floor to the rapporteur and then proceed to the vote on the resolution."
"Mr President, although in my view there are still many negative points regarding the substance of the text, I consider that we are enabling the discussion process on this important subject to continue with a legislative act, with the rejection of the Commission procedure without codecision, and with very clear signals regarding the rejection of liberalisation in some sectors and we are introducing a sound evaluation process, so I am voting in favour."
"Mr President, Mrs Sandbæk, the rapporteur, has agreed to change 'working' to 'being exploited', meaning that the wording would now be: 'this must extend to women being exploited'."
". Mr President, I would just like to table an oral amendment to Mrs Boudjenah’s amendment inserting the word ‘Notes’ at the beginning: ‘Notes that the Action Plan for Africa announced by the G8 in 2002 has still not been reflected by precise commitments; calls on the G8 and the EU swiftly to help to make the necessary resources available so as to help achieve the aims set by NEPAD’."
"That concludes the vote."
".– The purpose of this report is to protect fisheries and the European Union tuna processing industry against competition from elsewhere."
"This concern is even more disputable given that the Community tuna fleet is already the largest in the world and is using the whole world’s fish resources, including those of many poor countries."
"Moreover, the competition often comes from fleets which, even though they operate under the flags of other countries, belong to investors from the European Community."
"The report is right to express concern about the reduction in tuna resources."
"Competition, which causes waste and crises in all sectors of the economy, has even more disastrous consequences in the case of natural resources, which can be completely exhausted by fierce and irrational competition."
"The only logical conclusion that can be drawn from this report is that a system based on competition is damaging and that the only sound way of managing natural resources would be to manage them collectively, in a planned manner."
"This management should be done at global level and not with the sole aim of protecting European Union production, as tuna have the annoying habit of not respecting borders and territorial waters."
"We abstained."
". Community fleets account for over 20% of the world tuna catch and are among the main sources of raw material supplies to the tinned fish industry."
"Portugal accounts for 6% of EU tinned tuna production, which in turn represents around 40% of Portuguese tinned fish production."
"This illustrates the importance of the tuna fleet and industry based in less developed, outlying regions that are highly dependent on the fisheries sector."
"The sector has lost competitiveness in the face of pressure from foreign imports, as a result of bilateral and multilateral commercial agreements, and has also been adversely affected by the last reform of the common fisheries policy, which took place in December 2002."
"I therefore endorse the main idea underpinning this report, namely that the Commission draw up a study on the state of tuna resources, the fleet and the industry as a whole, and subsequently present an action plan for the tuna sector that provides a global framework of structural aid and a plan to protect the sector against competition from third countries."
"We have always advocated the need for compensation or consumption subsidies to support the canning sector and for monitoring imports, in order to ensure that imported fish meets the same criteria for food safety and quality as products from the Community industry."
"In spite of some sound efforts, current fisheries policy still means that the EU is buying the right to misuse the natural resources of the poor."
"It is a modern form of colonialism."
"What is required is genuine reform of fisheries policy and a totally altered view of our relations with poor countries."
"I have therefore chosen to vote against the aforesaid report in its entirety."
".The aim of the report is to strengthen the few large fishing companies through economic and institutional measures in order to improve their competitiveness."
"As excuses for this strengthening, the rapporteur cites the indisputably high nutritional value of the product, its economic value, employment, maintaining stocks etc."
"These excuses conceal the fact that this activity concerns a few large companies in the ΕU and that the developed countries overexploit the world's marine wealth at the expense of poor and developing countries, in that the international fishing agreements are imbalanced, safeguarding as they do the rights of the strong."
"The report's acceptance of subsidies to renew the fleet, export subsidies and duty on and technocratic obstacles to imports provocatively strengthens certain businessmen and makes the international division of labour even more unfair here, at the expense of poor and developing countries."
"We wish to point out that, in the report, subsidies for withdrawing large vessels from the tuna fleet are described, and rightly so, as counterproductive and catastrophic, which is why it proposes that they be abolished and redirected towards renewing the fleet."
"However, the same subsidies for withdrawing small and medium-sized coastal and short-haul fishing vessels are put forward by the ΕU as structural funds allegedly to restructure the corresponding sectors."
"This contradiction again confirms the class policy of the ruling circles of the ΕU at the expense of small and medium-sized fisheries for the benefit of the large capitalist fishing companies."
". Given that tuna is the most commercially successful fishery resource in the world, I congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries for this own-initiative report on the tuna fleet and processing industry."
"The report concludes that Member States stand only to benefit if the EU decides to do more for this sector of the fishing industry."
"It is impossible to argue with such a conclusion, in view of the Community tuna fleet and industry’s loss of competitiveness, along with the major contribution of these areas to the EU – the canning industry provides around 40 000 jobs in the EU and tuna accounts for almost 60% of total tinned fish production."
"I endorse the suggestion that the Commission should draw up a specific action plan and an overall structural support framework for the tuna sector."
"I acknowledge the importance of the EU’s making absolutely sure that, within the Regional Fisheries Organisations, the fleet is adapted to available resources, which will, where possible, ensure stability and renewal."
"This adaptation must involve combating the over-fishing practised by illegal vessels flying flags of convenience, and this might entail, as envisaged in the report, drawing up a list of those vessels that comply with the relevant rules and will be allowed in the fisheries, and imposing trade sanctions for vessels that do not comply."
".– Everything should be smiling on the Community fisheries and tuna industry."
"They have enterprising professionals of high quality, particularly in France and Spain, and are offering healthy, natural food, for which there is high and growing demand."
"However, even though the Commission claims to be the sole embodiment of the ‘common European good’, it is itself weakening European competitiveness."
"The draconian and constantly increasing constraints of Community legislation particularly affect security, monitoring, the health conditions of production, the protection of the environment and social protection, resulting in much higher costs for the Community fleet and its producers than those of their competitors."
"The ideology of systematic and complete opening up of the market that drives the Commission is being applied to marine produce, with the permanent extension of the list of the countries benefiting from tariff preferences, with a particularly opaque system of certificates of origin, and the tuna loins quota and canned tuna quota opened for Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia."
"Our rapporteur highlights ‘…the opening of the Community market to foreign products with less strict requirements and insufficient monitoring, which is damaging the competitiveness of Community products.’"
"It is time to put a stop to this discrimination imposed by the Commission to the detriment of our economies and jobs."
". This regulation is aimed at updating the current Community legislative framework relating to detergents, which dates back to the beginning of the 1970s and has been spread across a number of legislative instruments."
"Despite certain limitations and the fact that it does not go far enough, the regulation does contain some excellent proposals aimed at preserving the environment, such as monitoring biodegradability, and aimed at protecting consumers, who must be guaranteed information on the composition of products, lists of ingredients and effective labelling."
"We therefore support the compromise amendments tabled to the report before us and endorsed by seven parliamentary groups."
"We regret, however, that labels are not required to carry explicit warnings of the risks, especially to children, of ingesting detergents, and that the use of images that may be misleading, such as images of fruit, are not banned."
"Let us not forget that behind regulatory harmonisations there are always ulterior political motives towards greater market integration and the elimination of obstacles to the free movement of goods."
"This leads us to have strong reservations, as it may undermine the right of Member States to legislate effectively on crucial questions such as the protection of human health, of the environment or of consumers’ rights, by imposing restrictions on products that do not comply with such rules."
". What is negative about this proposal is that it gives priority to eliminating barriers to free movement."
"On a positive note, though, Member States that have, for the protection of their environment, already put legislation in place that is stricter than this regulation will not be hindered in enforcing it."
"The reason for this regulation is that by washing and cleaning, not only are contaminations added to clean water, but also components of soap and other surfactants."
"For many years, attempts have been made to encourage the production of phosphate-free detergents."
"This proposal now also tries to discourage animal tests, the addition of substances that break down with difficulty, toxic chemical substances and substances with hormone-disruptive characteristics."
"The disclosure of the composition of detergents is indeed a major step forward."
"Attempts are being made to that effect by requiring manufacturers to inform the government of their products' composition and by obliging them to list the actual content of preservatives, colour-protection products and aromatic substances on the packaging."
"Openness with regard to harmfulness is to be welcomed, and so we should try to convince the Council of this, but a general ban on harmful substances would be preferable."
"The proposed adaptations to the regulation in the longer term may be able to contribute to this."
"Manufacturers may protest, but stricter measures are unavoidable."
"– Mr President, I would just like to say that I voted in favour of Mr De Rossa’s report out of my conviction that apes and other exotic species are among our planet’s valuable resources and that any modern and highly-developed system of protection for nature and the environment should protect and maintain these resources for the sake of future generations."
"I regard Mr De Rossa’s report as an excellent piece of work towards this end, one that will contribute to the protection and maintenance of endangered species."
"It also draws attention to the need to protect such species and raises popular awareness of that need."
"It was good that Amendment No 2 was adopted;"
"I had hoped that the two other amendments would be as well."
"That has not happened, but, as what we have here is in any case a workable solution, I have voted in favour of it."
".– Who could disagree with the general idea of protecting wild animal species, some of which are in danger of extinction?"
"The report, though, marks out the limits of its own proposals by rightly stating that the ‘issue of bushmeat hunting and its threat to endangered species, notably the great apes, must be addressed in the context of overall development strategy and poverty alleviation’."
"No proposals are made in this respect, however."
"How can proposals be made without calling into question the existing economic and social system, a system that is starving millions of human beings for whom bushmeat is often the only source of animal protein, particularly in tropical areas?"
"Under these circumstances, the methods of monitoring or retaliation proposed will be entirely ineffective in the majority of cases, particularly against organised gangs who carry out mass hunts, often for Western markets, and will affect only a few starving people."
"We abstained on this report."
"This topic would not have found its way onto the agenda had it not been for a petition signed by nearly 2 million people and had it not been for the Committee on Petitions, which took the decision, a year ago, to draft a report on the subject. The 'bush meat' phenomenon is already enjoying wide public attention in Great Britain, but not yet elsewhere."
"Despite this, it is important for development cooperation, public health and the environment that awareness of this phenomenon should increase in Europe and that a policy on it should actually be adopted."
"The population in the developing countries is growing fast, while scope for trade and transport is also increasing."
"In the past, small groups of people used to hunt wild animals living in the jungle for their own meat consumption."
"These days, this meat of monkeys, reptiles and snakes is not only consumed by poor local residents, but is also sold in African towns and even exported to Europe as a delicacy for the rich."
"The commercial hunt of animals and the felling of tropical forests result in the rapid extinction of animal species, including gorillas and chimpanzees."
"Scarcely-controllable animal diseases, such as Ebola, are spread among people."
"Development cooperation on the part of the EU takes no account of this destruction or of the environment in general."
"I support proposals for eco-tourism, protection, education and legislation, even though they probably leave something to be desired."
". In spite of the potentially ambiguous nature of the word ‘bushmeat’ and of evidence that hunting is not solely responsible for decimating wild animal populations – in Europe this is often a factor in protection and in stabilising numbers – I voted in favour."
"The term ‘bushmeat’, or wild animal meat, describes the food product of wild animals, the trade in which has had a devastating effect on the African Great Ape population."
"The effect of the illegal trade in bushmeat has attracted worldwide attention."
"UNEP and UNESCO established GrASP (Great Apes Survival Project) and there are many other organisations working to find ways to address the problem."
"The EU has so far, however, paid only scant attention to the issue, as highlighted by the rapporteur."
"On 12 July 2000, the Committee on Petitions received a petition on the protection of species endangered by illegal hunting and trade, as part of a campaign against bushmeat."
"By voting in favour, I am simply expressing my agreement that developing countries do indeed need greater support to ensure that, while local traditions are respected and particular account is taken of the shortage of food, we see greater rigour ..."
"I voted in favour of the report as soon as Parliament adopted Amendment No 2, in which bushmeat is defined as meat from ‘wild animals in tropical areas’."
"Otherwise, an unfortunate situation would have arisen in which hunting restrictions and animal protection would have applied to meat from all wild animals, including Swedish species such as elk."
"Swedish elk stocks are stable, while hunting is carried on in such a way that the species is not in decline, still less threatened with extinction."
"Regulated Swedish elk hunting and the illegal hunting of apes and other wild animals threatened with extinction occupy quite separate worlds."
".– By adopting the Herzog report, the European Parliament has adopted some excellent statements on ‘the fundamental importance of the subsidiarity principle’ and on the need to respect the free choice of the Member States in terms of the missions, organisation and financing arrangements of services of general interest at national level (see paragraph 18)."
"At the same time, however, it has left the way open for a European regulation process which, if developed, would violate that subsidiarity and once again lead to protests in a few years’ time against intervention from Brussels."
"As I said during the debate, I regret having to say that the previous French Presidency was behind the idea of a European legal framework."
"The current French Government appears to have gone back to a more cautious position as, although it is still calling for a ‘cross-border legal instrument’, it wants to limit the content to a sharing of responsibilities between the Member States of the EU, authorised financing and monitoring procedures."
"This is still too much, and the Commission will still find arguments for infiltrating and wanting to regulate everything."
"In our view, it is sufficient to state that services of general interest fall under the competence of the Member States, who choose their missions, their organisation and their limits."
".– Despite all the concessions made by the author of the report to the reactionary political forces working for the privatisation of public services, he now seems to have been overcome by those whose support he wished to obtain."
"Amended or not, the Herzog report legislates for the disappearance of the public services, including their name, which has changed to ‘services of general interest’."
"We are opposed to this report and, of course, to the amendments that make it worse."
"Education, health, public transport, postal services, telecommunications, water and energy supplies, electricity and waste disposal should remain or be restored as public services that are separate from the stupid and inhuman laws of the market, not to produce private profit but to satisfy collective needs."
"Moreover, the process set out in the report translates into drastic reductions in staff, in other words a social catastrophe."
"On the pretext of harmonising practices between the different countries that make up the European Union, its authorities are creating a serious social decline."
"Nevertheless, harmonisation could be done on the basis of development of the public services and expanding them, especially by building social housing, if the European institutions and the Member States were serving collective, rather than private, interests."
"We therefore voted against this report."
".– Driven by the socialist and social democrat political family, the notion of services of general economic interest was enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam (Article 16) at the heart of the principles on which the European Union is based."
"As a step further, the European socialists resolutely committed themselves to defending and promoting services of general interest, as a fundamental aspect of our shared values and of our European social model."
"Upon this concept, democratic and social guarantees for European citizens are founded: equal access for all, information, consultation and participation for users and employees, quality and universality and financial viability while respecting employment and collective guarantees."
"Our battle lines have been drawn; our demands are clear."
"We are asking for the missions, organisation and financing arrangements for services of general interest to be guaranteed and laid down in a framework directive, a commitment made by Parliament as a whole in November 2001 when it adopted the Langen report."
"We want a democratic and pluralist evaluation of the social consequences of free competition to be conducted before there is any further liberalisation."
"This is an urgent issue judging by the flurry of texts submitted to the European Parliament in order to speed up liberalisation all over the place, in particular in transport, postal services, energy, the water market, waste treatment."
"– The trend of the votes on the recitals, paragraphs and amendments of the Herzog report is a perfect illustration, even a caricature, of the weight of liberalism and the single market, and of their precedence over all other considerations in modern-day Europe."
"Paraphrasing Jean de la Fontaine, it could be said of the large parties and political forces of the European Parliament, that ‘nobody died from them, but they affected everyone ‘"
"For a large majority in Parliament, and therefore much of institutional Europe, public service is at best a commodity like any other when it is not ‘a barrier’ to the happiness money brings."
"I therefore voted against this report without any uncertainty or hesitation."
". – Introducing high-performance and efficient services of general interest for all, that is to say services which play a full role in social and territorial cohesion, means not only acknowledging and asserting that these services of general interest are an essential goal of Member States’ economic and social policies and among the fundamental elements of our European model of society, but also that we adopt and defend the basic principles that serve as the operational basis of these services of general interest, namely the universality of services, continuity, affordability and quality."
"Without the adoption of certain amendments, including those relating to the framework directive, it is these principles themselves that are likely to fall by the wayside; there is a risk of the drift toward ultraliberalism caused by sectoral directives becoming the norm."
"I do not wish to take such a risk."
"Without voting on these amendments on the requirement of a framework directive, I rejected the text at the final vote."
". – The Herzog report attempted to reconcile the irreconcilable, championing liberalisation and defending services of general interest at the same time; hence the discordant voting."
"Must we support this ‘hybrid’ product which ‘highlights the fact that liberalisation has not been to the detriment of the provision of universal service’, which ‘considers the liberalisation to date in the gas market insufficient’ while considering that the problems encountered in the liberalisation of certain sectors make it necessary to assess the impact on employment in a pluralist and open manner?"
"The rapporteur, faced with his mutilated draft and having taken the ultraliberal forces of Parliament hostage, thought that, all considered, it was worth supporting."
"As for me, along with all those who have not succumbed to Stockholm syndrome, I have kept a cool head."
"The amended text is indefensible and I therefore voted against it."
". – I voted against the motion for a resolution on services of general interest since the voting trends of the majority of MEPs do not give an objective picture of the consequences of the liberalisation undertaken to date."
"Furthermore, they pave the way for the liberalisation of other sectors."
"Today, as we have already asked in the past, we must hold a serious, pluralist and open assessment of liberalisation policy and make the conclusions public."
"We must re-examine the liberalisation that has taken place, in order to make the adoption of a framework directive as effective as possible."
"Furthermore, it is high time we definitively excluded some sectors from the prevailing competition policy at Community level."
"This applies particularly to health, education and social services, including social housing."
"Finally, we must guarantee the subsidiarity under which local or territorial powers are exercised."
"This motion does not establish European services of general interest as an added value of the European structure but as a means of achieving the EU’s territorial, economic, ecological and social cohesion goals."
"Services of general interest are an essential element of our social model, which we must defend and promote."
"."
"We voted against the Herzog report in the final vote, because we considered it fell short of what was required, having been watered down by proposals from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The odd improvement was made to the report in plenary, but the amendments that had been tabled did not change it significantly."
"The final result illustrates the aggressiveness of the neo-liberal and conservative offensive currently sweeping through the EU, in the wake of rushed-through privatisations enshrined in the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ and attempts to enshrine these in the Constitution last December."
"The report is fundamentally biased against the public sector and against the role of the State in the economy, as it is based on the false premise that it is ownership that determines good management."
"The clear aim is to feed the most lucrative sectors and public services to the greed of the major economic and financial groups."
"The report endorses and encourages the process of liberalisation/privatisation in various key sectors and abjectly glosses over the economic and social consequences, from quality and access to public services, to job losses in the targeted sectors."
"We all know that the expression ‘services of general interest’ was not chosen by accident."
"Its clear aim is to put an end to the concept of public service and, in so doing, to alleviate the State’s burden of responsibility."
"We voted against the Herzog report, which shows once again that this Parliament is no more in favour of progress than are the Commission or the Council of the European Union."
"The ultraliberal majority in Parliament introduced this report as a paean to the destruction of public services."
"To quote only one point from ten or twenty articles which are along the same lines, we read that Parliament ‘welcomes the liberalisation in the fields of telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy, which has led to modernisation, interconnection and integration of the sectors, has led to price reductions through increased competition, and has led to the creation of nearly one million jobs across the European Union’."
"And it wants to speed things up."
"What we see at work here is a mendacious dogmatism that collides head-on with the wishes of the European people."
"It is regrettable that the rapporteur, like a significant proportion of European socialists, chose to vote for this report because it opens up the prospect of a framework directive on services of general interest."
"But must we do it on such a liberal basis?"
"In this setting, only street-level activism on the largest scale can create a positive outlook in the face of the destruction of public services."
"This report is political trickery pure and simple because, in spite of the tragic comedy played out in this Chamber, right and left are basically on the same track, which is to say: destroy public services by forever subjecting them to Community competition law, a law which, as everyone knows, has always been the least discriminate instrument of the free market."
"French MEPs belonging to the UMP party, bound by the decisions of their ultraliberal parliamentary group, voted against France’s better interests by approving a text containing numerous provisions that plainly doom the existence of public services in France."
"As for the socialist-communist left, it has, in the name of blind European federalism, never ceased to call for the adoption of a ‘framework directive’ on public services, a text that would inevitably involve Member States’ competences being transferred to the European Commission."
"Resolutely opposed to the euroglobalist ideology that inspired this report, and which is itself a product of the shameful alliance of political federalism and economic ultraliberalism, the members of the were the only French members to clearly and coherently state their rejection of this new antinational and antisocial offensive against our public services."
"Trains used to run, planes used to fly, the post used to arrive, healthcare used to exist, schools used to teach and there was light, all thanks to national public services."
"But the Commission of Brussels wants to privatise them, flying in the face of reason, fact and social concerns."
"Intelligence takes a back seat as we slip from the glorious notion of services provided to the public, in the name of the common good and the , to the wretched concept of services provided by general interest."
"Market integrationism flies in the face of facts when it refuses to see that private trains in Britain are derailing, that electricity in California is cutting out, that the planes of private airlines such as Flash Airlines are crashing and that American commercial schools are leaving souls helpless."
"Social concerns are sacrificed because with liberalisation, there is two-tier access to healthcare, university, transport or even water: services for the rich and services for the poor."
"All this is led by Mr Herzog, the communist rapporteur who has become ‘party to the rout’ of economic and social democracy."
". I am an advocate of a Europe in which the economy is gradually brought more under democratic control."
"This requires an entirely different course than that currently being pursued with the Green Paper on services of general interest, which makes Europe even more neo-liberal."
"The Stability Pact is used as a big stick to compel Member States to liberalise and privatise important sectors of their economy, at the expense of democratic say and control over the social and public sectors."
"Despite the acknowledgment that certain services must be accessible and affordable for everyone because social coherence and solidarity depend upon them, there is hardly any part of the public sector that is sacrosanct."
"In fact, opportunities are being offered to place higher education, public health, social services and the provision of drinking water in private hands."
"In addition, old sectoral liberalisation plans are strictly adhered to for postal services, gas, electricity and public transport."
"The results of past liberalisation programmes are being extolled, mistakenly so, as shown by the experience of the Netherlands and of other countries, where, quite in contrast, the liberalisation of public transport and energy has proved highly detrimental to the inhabitants."
"Despite what the Green Paper claims, they have become more expensive."
"The provision of services has gone down and employment is in the balance."
"My party advocates a course that is entirely different from the one described here and will therefore be voting against this proposal."
". I welcome this Report on the Green Paper on services of general interest."
"It gives Parliament the opportunity to outline the future for public services. This should not involve unbridled liberalisation; it should involve a careful reflection on what has gone before and on what has and has not worked."
"There are some areas where I differ from my colleagues in the Socialist Group."
"I believe that public radio and television broadcasters who play a major role in preserving cultural diversity and identity should be exempted from the competition rules."
"The same should be the case for charitable organisations which carry out a public service."
"The last point I wish to make is that, when the legislation comes back to Parliament, there must be full engagement of that institution and that means codecision."
"While not without its critics, Community competition law does not preclude maintaining public services."
"This compatibility is established in Article 295 of the EC Treaty, and set out so that public services must respect rules of competition."
"Although there have been corporatist protests from the eternal supporters of the status quo who, under the pretext of defending public service, only want to preserve their statutory privileges, we must also note that opening public services up to competition is ultimately a vehicle for modernisation and competitiveness."
"The real problem here concerns the sharing of competences between the EU and the Member States."
"In this regard, however, a ‘framework directive’ defining ‘good government in the area (…) of services of general interest’, a motion backed by the Left in this House, is absolutely unacceptable to the real defenders of public service: those who reject the pervading demagogy and support a Europe of nations, because it would end up communising public services."
"The vital point in this matter is that competences relating to the organisation and functioning of public services remain the sole preserve of the sovereign States."
". The creation and maintenance of services of general interest represents one of the pillars of the ‘European model’ of development, as it guarantees that, within a market economy framework – or rather, a social market economy framework – certain fundamental rights are sacrosanct."
"The individual citizen holds rights, and is not merely a unit of production or a pawn of the free market."
"I agree with the rapporteur that special attention must be paid to rural and socially disadvantaged areas, with emphasis on the outermost regions."
"I also endorse his view that social services of general interest that carry out social security and social inclusion functions should remain exempt from competition rules."
"I support the idea that, in accordance with the Treaties and with the necessary respect for the principle of subsidiarity, the Community must be neutral in relation to Member States’ options on forms of property."
"The proposed clarification of the concept of services of general economic interest and of criteria for distinguishing between categories of services of general interest must not be allowed to lead to greater centralisation or to artificial standardisation."
"It is essential that the public authorities responsible for such services should enjoy freedom of choice."
"In light of the vote in plenary on the matter before us and given that proposals for a framework directive were not passed, I voted in favour."
". Because the British experience of liberalisation has generally been a positive one, albeit one with unequal benefits for consumers and the economy, the EPLP concurs with the general approach of the Commission."
"However, the EPLP believes there is a need for universality of service and for the protection of workers' rights and other social, environmental and economic benefits, both at the individual and the collective level."
"To this end the EPLP has voted to support those amendments which focused on those areas."
"Rather than a framework directive as called for by the rapporteur, the EPLP believes these issues should be decided on a sector-by-sector basis."
"The EPLP does not want to halt liberalisation, nor does it wish to prejudice competition laws and regulations. These are necessary in order for market reform to complete the single market and to achieve the Lisbon goals."
"As a former pupil of the ‘Public Service’ department of the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, and as a local councillor specifically responsible for maintaining local public services, I do not think that the best way to preserve the notion of public service is to adopt a European framework directive, which would affect the freedom of Member States to define the tasks they intend to entrust to public services, in accordance with the wishes of their people."
"It is not for countries that have historically lacked a public service culture to prevent those which do possess one from providing these services when they think it justified to do so."
"It is unfortunate that the incoherent and contradictory text resulting from the vote on the Herzog report will not clarify the debate."
"While it does have its good points, such as reiterating the ‘fundamental importance of the subsidiarity principle, in accordance with which the competent authorities of the Member State are free to make their choice of missions, organisation and financing arrangements for services of general interest’, at the same time it leaves open the possibility of imposing a uniform European definition of these services, which would deprive States of their regulatory power and would necessarily be inspired by a majority to whom the notion of public service is alien."
"This is why I abstained from voting on the final text."
"I have today voted in favour of Mr Herzog’s report on services of general interest and have, in that connection, also supported a list of amendments that support the idea of a framework directive in this area."
"In this connection, it must be made clear that we only want a framework directive that respects the principle of subsidiarity and that is confined to regulating services of a general economic character and does not therefore seek to regulate areas such as education, public health and services of general social interest."
". HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria kill around 20 000 people every day, and thousands more new clinical cases are diagnosed."
"These diseases are particularly prevalent in developing countries, especially in the least developed countries ravaged by war, poverty, economic decline and the collapse of essential public services, especially health care systems."
"The harsh reality is that ‘millions of people in developing countries continue to die each year from infectious diseases, most of which can be prevented and cured by medicine’."
"This is the profit-driven approach, an approach that commercialises health, adopted by the large pharmaceutical multinationals which are primarily based in developed countries."
"Patents on medicines and lack of investment in the production of local medicines are thus significant hurdles that must be overcome."
"Any minor progress in the framework of the WTO continues to come up against formidable financial interests."
"The EU programme currently under discussion, aimed at combating these diseases, is to be welcomed, yet does not go far enough."
"The efforts of the international community must focus especially on strengthening the human, institutional and infrastructural resources of developing countries, particularly in order to restore public services and basic health care systems and to ensure that medicine can be produced independently."
"The Commission’s Programme for Action entitled ‘accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction; outstanding policy issues and future challenges’ was based on three approaches: improving effectiveness, making medicines more affordable and increasing R[amp]D (Research and Development)."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s proposal to encourage patent-holder companies to grant licences that allow other companies to manufacture their products at lower cost; using safeguards in international trade agreements that can help governments to expand access to medicines and protect public health."
"We need to see more R[amp]D and new medicines and instruments of diagnosis that are easier to use, more effective and more affordable."
"Similarly, particular emphasis must be given to disseminating routine child and maternal health care, so as to reduce mortality rates."
"The EU must not remain indifferent to such issues and its financial contribution must increase accordingly."
"I voted in favour, as I feel that the problems arising from poverty-linked disease are so serious that only by establishing a broad range of far-reaching policies and strategies will we be able to solve them in all their aspects."
". The OECD emphasises that 'Investment in health is an important means of economic development and substantially improved health outcomes are a prerequisite for developing countries to break out of the cycle of poverty."
"If the health of poor people is to improve, a ‘pro-poor’ health approach is needed."
"This goes beyond the health sector and includes policies in areas that disproportionately affect the health and economic security of the poor, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation.'"
"HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are direct causes and consequences of poverty, which particularly expose women and children."
"I welcome the goodwill of the international community and I urge our governments to enhance respectful partnership, specifically in the field of health."
"Nevertheless, I must abstain: the means proposed to fight the 'very high and rising' number of HIV/AIDS-infected women, is to provide 'appropriate sexual and reproductive health information and services', to protect against, 'unwanted pregnancies'."
"Pregnancy is not an illness: children are a richness in developing countries."
"This reveals another agenda which interprets reproductive health to include abortion."
"However, this is not the position of the Council, which has clarified that 'reproductive health' does NOT include 'abortion'."
"Until this is clarified by the Commission, I cannot support this ambiguous terminology."
"We voted against this report, which takes a cynically paternalistic attitude towards African countries."
"For example, how dare it state that these countries ‘should devote resources to establishing a strategy of sustainable, equitable and viable development opening the way to genuine employment of the right to food, health, education, housing and other necessities for African peoples’?"
"Even in rich western countries, the dominant class deprives a large proportion of the population of these rights!"
"African peoples have to bear, however, in addition to those of their own privileged class, the far more considerable impositions of industrial and financial groups of imperialist countries."
"From the time of the slave trade to the present day, where these countries are bled dry by the global banking system, through the pillaging of the colonial era, western capitalism has never stopped impoverishing this continent."
"Today, the European Parliament, the parliament of the countries whose leaders can be blamed for reducing African countries to misery, gracefully leave these countries to repair the damage done to them over the centuries themselves!"
"It is deplorable."
"The subject is much debated, in as much as the very neoliberal tendencies of NEPAD raise legitimate questions among all those who dream of finally seeing Africa emerge from under-development."
"I also support the criticisms made by the report, particularly with regard to the absence of democratic consultation of ‘civil society’, of unions and even of national parliaments."
"Conducting an independent study on NEPAD’s impact on social rights, food safety, access to raw materials and protection of the environment is undoubtedly the greatest encouragement to emerge."
"The fact remains that the responsibilities of the EU and of the G8 must not be relinquished, whether this means it is necessary to cancel the debt – which continues to drastically and unjustly suffocate budgets – or a reform and increase of public aid for development."
"It is estimated that 64 billion dollars are required per year to achieve the goals set by NEPAD."
"Fund providers must face up to their responsibilities."
"Welcoming the Heads of State that established NEPAD to the G8 with great pomp is one thing, backing up words with actions is quite another."
"Finally, the drafting of a legally restrictive framework accompanied by sanctions for businesses that contribute to conflicts would also be appropriate in preventing conflicts that are often murderous."
"NEPAD is without doubt a development project conceived and adopted by the African states, but it should not be looked upon as a project that will emancipate the African people."
"Indeed, it is increasingly denounced, like the Cotonou Agreement, the WTO and the IMF’s structural adjustment policies, by sectors of civil society such as the Addis Ababa African Social Forum and the People’s Forum held in Siby in Mali in 2003."
"In fact, it is part of a neo-liberal logic, the actual consequences of which run counter to the objectives laid down."
"There can be no appropriation of development at either national or regional level while the Washington Consensus, imposed on the current African leaders to later be taken over, provides for the private appropriation of the most profitable economic heritage by the multinationals."
"Thus, the social rights and freedoms acquired over the last three decades of independence are being dismantled through the revision of national labour and investment codes."
"The fact that NEPAD consulted the multinationals and the G8 rather than the African people says a lot about its idea of democracy."
"As a result, we cannot vote for a resolution that merely criticises the lack of consultation while concealing the fundamental, harmful logic underpinning NEPAD."
". This report on the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), a political initiative of major importance undertaken by five African Heads of State, as part of an ambitious project known as ‘African Renaissance’, places emphasis on conflict prevention and on implementing support mechanisms for restoring and maintaining peace, action against corruption, which is essential for good governance."
"The initiative is further underscored by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), which I also endorse."
"I agree, furthermore, that it is essential to encourage the participation of members of civil society, including human rights organisations."
"The role of women in African society must also be brought to the fore in development projects."
"Notwithstanding the occasional criticisms made of NEPAD for its top-down approach, I feel that we must give the initiative our wholehearted support and must contribute towards improving its effective human and social impact."
"We must help to remove hundreds of people from the mire of underdevelopment and play an active role in combating the corruption and tyranny endemic in large parts of the African continent."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"I particularly welcome this report, as I have striven for a new perspective on Africa, a new perspective on a forgotten continent and a perspective of fraternity and solidarity towards a brother Continent."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as a citizen of Venice who has therefore inherited a strong historical, cultural and linguistic identity – I recall the Most Serene Venetian Republic – I hope that all the countries in the European Union will adopt policies aimed at devolving the competences of the state to the regions, especially policies on state-sector education, culture and the protection of cultural assets."
"We believe that it is precisely our cultural diversity and cultural identities that form the major attraction of this Europe, which should not try to centralise but should leave room for the regionalisms and identities of all the peoples it embraces."
"I therefore want to underline the need to refocus on these identities in their own local areas, so that the great cultural heritage that unites all the peoples of Europe can be an example of democracy and especially of the great strength of our diversity in this our European identity."
"– As the report states, it is necessary to arrive at a legal framework under international law for the right to cultural diversity."
"In addition – something that is very important from the point of view of the independence and regionalist movements such as the one I represent in this Parliament, the Lega Nord – the report quite rightly underlines the need for vigilance concerning the treatment of minority populations and languages, especially including indigenous languages, within the context of an enlarged Europe."
"With regard to the protection of the languages of minority populations, the Member States are invited, where appropriate, to pay particular attention to the conservation of monuments, buildings and everyday implements, which form the material history of these cultures."
"There is a need, however, for a much broader and more thorough measure to protect everything that makes up the immense cultural heritage of minority languages and peoples: literature, art, folklore, books and manuscripts, which are in danger of disappearing."
"Within Padania, for instance, there is an immense linguistic cultural heritage, ranging from Piedmontese to the Venetian language, as mentioned by Mr Gobbo, to Lombard, Ladin and a host of endangered minority languages. For them, it is vital that the devolution policy sponsored by the current Italian Government should be adopted."
"Mr President, we are committed to safeguarding cultural diversity in the Union and to promoting a pluralistic media."
"However, we abstained on the proposals set out simply because we believe that they are largely inoperable and that other instruments can be used in order to achieve our objectives."
"Overall, we concur with the rapporteur on the desirability of linguistic diversity, the definition of cultural goods as a public good, the desirability of public sector broadcasting and the undesirability of media concentration."
"However, paragraphs 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 32 and 33 unnecessarily pre-empt the UNESCO conclusions to be drawn in 2005, let alone inhibiting, as they do, the room for manoeuvre on cultural areas in the negotiations in Cancun."
"Mr President, like the majority in this House I have voted in favour of the excellent report by Mrs Prets on this very sensitive issue."
"The problem is that whenever stateless nations of the European Union, such as the Basque country, try to implement approved guidelines, the French and Spanish authorities adopt a thoroughly contemptuous attitude."
"Last week in Bayonne, people were ejected from a court of law and sprayed with tear gas because they had dared to speak in Basque and promote the use of the Basque language in public services."
"Members of this House will shortly receive full information on this regrettable incident."
"I must point out that the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, attached to this report, states that cooperation policy in the European Union is 'unthinkable without respect for and promotion of cultural diversity as an integral part of the identity of the political entities and communities involved.'"
". – The Radical Members voted against the report not only because it opposes the liberalisation of international trade and surrenders to cultural relativism, as well as protectionism, but also because it does not seem to understand the dangers of cultural and linguistic annihilation at the hands of nationalists and proponents of state control."
"National policies that undermine linguistic diversity in the teaching of foreign languages – that is, the obligation to learn just one foreign language, English – are dominant in both the European Union and the acceding countries."
"The European institutions themselves are often mono- or bilingual."
"The resolution lacks any reference to innovative solutions to communication requirements on a non-discriminatory basis, for instance by envisaging the use of neutral languages like the international language Esperanto."
"It also lacks any reference to the little protection afforded to the languages of indigenous populations and immigrants and to sign language."
"Of the concrete proposals that have already found a certain consensus at an international level, I should like to mention the proposal by the Esperanto Radical Association for the Language Policy Observatory, which was also recently recommended by UNESCO’s 32nd General Conference."
"There is indeed a need for an up-to-date picture of language practices and legislation and of the use and recognition of minority languages within states."
". I broadly welcome this own-initiative report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on preserving and encouraging cultural diversity, especially so during a fresh round of WTO talks."
"Unesco therefore took the initiative, at its conference of 17 October 2003, to begin work on producing a draft Convention on cultural diversity, with the aim of creating an international legal instrument that will protect and promote cultural diversity."
"The report before us makes a positive contribution towards this aim, with a series of recommendations to Member States and the Commission regarding Unesco’s work, such as consolidating cultural rights, fostering the development of public cultural policies in each State and committing all the parties involved to international cooperation."
"Among other points in the report, I welcome its reaffirmation of the principle of preserving and promoting cultural diversity and access to culture, as a contribution towards mutual understanding between people and towards peace."
"I endorse the report’s position that States have the right to define their own cultural policies."
"I also welcome the reaffirmation – as advocated by Unesco – that culture is not ‘merchandise’ and that it must be excluded from any process of liberalisation, be it multilateral or bilateral, as well as the reaffirmation of the role of public services."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"We fully share the view that cultural diversity should be recognised as a fundamental right, and we therefore choose to support Mrs Prets report on cultural diversity."
"The EU is, and must remain, a mosaic of minorities and cultures."
"As liberals, we always put the private individual at the centre of all political decisions."
"We therefore believe it to be of the greatest importance both to confirm in international law that every state or group of states has a legitimate right freely to decide what cultural policy they wish to pursue, and to strengthen the policy of international cooperation and solidarity on cultural issues."
"Linguistic diversity must also be retained within the EU."
"We are, however, dubious about the idea of the EU being legally entitled to take measures within the area of culture and the media in order to preserve and promote cultural diversity."
"We do not therefore wish to support the EU’s developing a legal instrument for cultural diversity."
". The EU is doing a great deal in order to involve a young generation in projects intended to link European unity and ideas about progress."
"These projects may end up verging on being propaganda rather than education."
"In channelling money to cultural organisations that propagate 'the European idea' by pursuing a general European interest, the EU’s objective is to create a more uniform European elite."
"In the worst-case scenario, the EU will eventually evolve into a power centre, with the power ending up in the hands of a Europe-wide English-speaking elite, putting anyone who does not speak this language at home or has an insufficient command of it at a disadvantage at work, and in terms of their ability to participate, and have a say, in politics."
"Deviating national and regional customs are then treated as a form of handicap."
"That is why it is positive that we should now finally set to defending cultural diversity against commerce and centralistic governance."
"I completely share the view of Mrs Prets, the rapporteur, that cultural services and products, and certainly the diversity of opinions, are not consumer goods capable of simply being handed over to the market."
"I support her ambition to exclude everything that pertains to this from trade liberalisation by WTO/GATT and to have it protected by a convention to be concluded in the framework of UNESCO."
". We agree with several points in the report at debate."
"For reasons of principle, we agree with the need to safeguard the right of cultural self-determination and the cultural diversity of the peoples of Europe and the whole world."
"The report partially formulates correctly certain of the causes of gradual cultural homogenisation and the commercialisation of culture (pressure from the WTO, internal rivalries both between the USA and the EU and within the ΕU itself, inability of UNESCO to play its role etc.)."
"Because we firmly believe in cultural diversity, as one of the last bastions defending the historic existence and continuing identity of peoples and as an historic necessity (as the report also recognises), we consider the proposed measures to be completely inadequate."
"The problem cannot be resolved within the framework of organisations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, let alone the ΕU."
"The only way to check and reverse this preplanned and culturally catastrophic advance is for the peoples to take the matter into their own hands, to fight against the logic and practices of the laws of the market dictated by imperialist globalisation and to demand respect for the values of their culture."
"For these reasons, the Communist Party of Greece did not support the report and abstained from the final vote."
". As our rapporteur (and the draftsman of our opinion) so eloquently expressed, ‘preserving the cultural heritage as the common heritage of mankind is a central concern of our civil society, and the preservation and encouragement of cultural diversity helps to ensure peace, security, stability and development’."
"This preservation requires specific actions."
"It was in this light that the Universal Declaration of Cultural Diversity drawn up by Unesco, and the Council of Europe’s Declaration on Cultural Diversity appeared."
"These declarations succeeded in going beyond mere trade aspects of educational and cultural services and cultural goods, by encompassing specific objectives such as the development of viable local cultural industries and improving the worldwide distribution of cultural works."
"The respect for and protection of cultural diversity are of crucial importance, from the point of view not only of collective awareness, but also of hopefully sustainable development."
"Cultural diversity is, in turn, in harmony with the world around us and is something that each generation inherits and then passes down."
"I believe that the EU must take a pro-active role in the discussion and emergence of new instruments at the next Unesco General Conference, capable of addressing the needs of a new world in which Europe must foster, with steadfast determination, the promotion of cultural diversity, make a contribution towards cultural dialogue and promote mutual understanding and respect."
". As well as providing an excellent discussion of the importance and the richness of cultural diversity, the report expressly calls for the rule of unanimity to be applied."
"This is not a blocking tactic, a charge all too frequently levelled, but the best guarantee of obtaining the consent of States and of the citizens."
"Another reason for us to be satisfied is the most compelling case the report makes for the need for the principle of subsidiarity to be respected and for ‘the right for the Member State, the regions and sub-state entities where appropriate to define, implement and adapt cultural policies’ before emphasising that ‘services and cultural products and education are not merchandise… and must therefore be made subject to special conditions… [which] must take account of the fact that the market cannot be the measure of all things, and must guarantee in particular diversity of opinion and pluralism’."
"The Members of the delegation to the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities have no alternative proposal."
"We support the concept of public service and reject the liberalisation of these sectors under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)."
"It is regrettable and worrying that these guidelines should not have been extended to all services of general interest in the vote on the Herzog report, but we give our unreserved support to the resolution on preserving and promoting cultural diversity in association with UNESCO."
". – Following on from Mr Cappato’s explanation of vote, I must underline the importance of the OSCE, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe."
"The OSCE promotes security in all ways other than direct armed intervention, and therefore makes every effort to promote respect for cultural and linguistic diversity."
"Two institutions operate within the OSCE to achieve this: the High Commissioner on National Minorities and the Representative on Freedom of the Media, who have continually been directing their attention to the subject of languages."
"Recently, at their meeting in Maastricht in December 2003, the foreign ministers of the OSCE countries adopted a decision on tolerance – Decision 4/03. Article 10 refers to the High Commissioner on National Minorities and his recommendations on education and languages, including in radio and television broadcasting."
"The decision also refers to the recommendations on this subject by the Representative on Freedom of the Media, the text of which can be found at www.osce.org. In 2002 and 2003 he carried out a thorough study on the media in multilingual societies, taking five countries as examples: Luxembourg, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova and Serbia-Montenegro."
"On 13 and 14 September the OSCE is organising a conference on racism and xenophobia, to be held in Brussels, during which I hope the subject of linguistic diversity will be addressed."
". The 2002 annual report on equal opportunities is relevant to the EU’s objectives."
"We have noted, however, a number of shortcomings in the report."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I believe it is essential to take a two-pronged approach, with the aim of ensuring equal treatment and equal pay, and genuine political mainstreaming of gender issues."
"Given that the growth of employment, particularly of women, is directly linked to whether it is possible to combine work with family life, the employment strategy must include references to funding and setting up facilities to care for children and dependents, and access to paid parental leave."
"It must also include targeted support measures to assist women in returning to work after raising a family."
"Every effort must be made to encompass areas as diverse as social security, training, enterprise initiatives, the inclusion of women in the decision-making process, extending working life, domestic violence and the trafficking of women."
". The own-initiative report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities rightly draws attention to important aspects of the framework strategy and to annual work programmes and reports on equal opportunities between men and women in the EU."
"These include the fact that the aims for the strategy have yet to be defined in measurable terms and that the annual reports do not manage to combine addressing the political aims that I have highlighted and a thorough analysis and evaluation of the current situation."
"Although it contains certain aspects that I consider contradictory, I agree with the report when it highlights the lack of coherence between UN policy – as defined in the Beijing Platform for Action – and EU policy on equal opportunities."
"I also welcome the fact that it points out the lack of information with regard to the execution of a number of Community programmes, and when it expresses disappointment that the 2003 work programme, relating to priority actions, does no more than reiterate previous intentions."
"I also agree with the rapporteur when she underlines the need for a report summarising the 1995 Platform for Action in Member States, to be tabled before the end of this legislative period."
"Unfortunately, good intentions have not been translated into reality."
"In the neo-liberal offensive against workers’ rights, social rights and other social gains, the first to be affected are always women, who face unemployment and unequal pay."
". The Commission is required to provide us with annual reports on the current situation as regards equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union."
"Today, we are to state our position on the annual report for 2002, a good practice that permits us to assess how things stand when it comes to implementing the fine European directives and programmes that are meant to guarantee equal treatment and equal opportunities to women and men."
"We all know that, where this is concerned, not all that glisters is gold in the Member States or in the accession countries, and that this House should and must denounce this is not a matter of dispute."
"There are, however, some passages in this otherwise astonishingly sensible motion for a resolution from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities that have to be modified."
"Various Members of this House have objected to the requirement that Member States and accession countries should, by 2010 provide good and affordable childcare facilities for at least 90% of children between three years of age and school age and for 33% of children under the age of three."
"They wonder whether that is either desirable or realistic, that is to say, affordable."
". On average, women in the EU earn 84% of what a man does, and the average unemployment rate for women in 2001 was 2.3% higher than for men."
"In the Explanatory Statement, the rapporteur demonstrates incisively that the many fine words about equal opportunities for men and women are, in practice, leading to little action, partly owing to a lack of measurable results."
"No clear objectives were set beforehand, and the assessment criteria laid down by the European Commission in its Framework Strategy for the period 2001-2005 do not reappear in its Annual Report for 2002."
"It is thus unclear what has been done or not been done, and what the results are."
"Furthermore, the Commission and the Council are working independently of each other."
"During the Finnish Presidency in late 1999, the Council established nine indicators with regard to women in responsible and decision-making jobs, to which were then added French indicators for the reconciliation of work and family life, Belgian indicators for unequal pay and Danish indicators for domestic violence against women."
"These are all nice things for ministers to tell their grass-roots support back home."
"No further mention of them is to be found in the annual reports, and the underlying documents remained confidential."
"It is a shame that the motion for a resolution adopted unanimously in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities lacks the firmness of the clear Explanatory Statement."
"I fear that, once again, little will change there."
". I feel that equality between men and women is of the utmost importance, and have always condemned sex discrimination."
"I am forced, however, to disagree with the rapporteur’s position, which, rather than fight for equality, seeks to impose egalitarian extremism."
"In order to make equality a reality it is not necessary to have the exact same number of men and women doing a particular job, it is much more important first to ensure that there is equal access to opportunities."
"The egalitarianism in the report before us is an absurd imposition, which offers a superficial impression of equality and would only reflect true representation, if at all, by coincidence."
"I do feel that many of the rapporteur’s ideas, in terms of EU law, could not be implemented in the EU, as they fall within the competences of Member States."
"I nonetheless endorse some of the points made in this own-initiative report, which do not, in any case, pertain exclusively to equality between men and women."
"I agree, for example, with the rapporteur’s criticism of the lack of transparency of decisions made within the Council, which prevents Parliament and the citizens from making a proper evaluation of its activities and its decisions."
"I voted against."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(1)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on preparations for the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
". Mr President, as a former United Nations human rights fellow and indeed as a former chairman of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, I am particularly pleased that my first address to Parliament should be on the European Union's preparations for the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions of 10 December 2002 contain concrete recommendations as to how the Council and the European Parliament can work more closely to achieve openness and transparency in the European Union's human rights policy."
"The Council is committed to putting those recommendations into practice."
"Enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and the Council on human rights issues is an important focus for the Irish presidency."
"Today's debate is a valuable part of that discourse."
"This is an area where we can make real progress if we work together."
"The European Union has always been determined to assume its international responsibilities."
"The Union's size, wealth, history and geography all point to our Union playing a prominent role in the period ahead."
"Human rights will remain at the heart of that role."
"A concern for human rights is at the core of European integration."
"We are much more than an economic area and an alliance of convenience."
"Ours is a Union which is based and built on values."
"Those values are essential conditions for membership."
"They are a compass that helps guide our external relations."
"We are committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for universal and indivisible human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."
"There can be no compromise on or denial of these principles."
"Europe has been at the fore in developing the concept of universal human rights."
"It was on our continent, Europe, that the idea of protecting human rights via written norms was first elaborated: the Magna Carta of 1215, the Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789 are all landmarks, but they are not the only landmarks."
"The attachment of Europe to human rights is not an abstract one: it was forged in the bitter experiences of European history – our common history."
"We need only look back to our own history to understand why the Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers in the starkest language to: 'disregard and contempt for human rights that have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.'"
"That sense of outrage has been used positively in the past half century to construct a new Europe that has learned from and not forgotten its history."
"This presidency believes strongly that human rights have a strategic part to play in confronting the major challenges of our time."
"There is no need to emphasise the close relationship between peace, security and stability on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other."
"Our presidency will reflect the central importance of human rights in all our external actions."
"Our Union can, rightly, be proud of the achievements of the last 50 years."
"We must never, however, become complacent."
"There is no part of the globe which is absolutely free from human rights abuses of one form or another."
"None of us in Europe, for example, is without fault: acts of racism, xenophobia and intolerance have not disappeared from our own societies."
"Believing in human rights means being ready to accept criticisms and working every day to strengthen respect for the freedoms that we all hold dear."
"We must remind ourselves, each and every day, that human rights are not for export only."
"If human rights within the Union are respected absolutely, unquestionably and visibly, our foreign policy will be more effective and more persuasive."
"We will be in a position to demand respect for basic principles and values – upon which all individual integrity and human decency are founded – from the international community only when those principles and values apply without equivocation in our Union."
"The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has played a pivotal role in the promotion and protection of human rights."
"It has been the standard-setter establishing monitoring mechanisms."
"The international community should rightly take pride in the Commission's unique contribution to this process and to the progress that has been achieved since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"While much has been achieved, more remains to be done."
"The European Union remains committed to cooperating with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations human rights mechanisms, special rapporteurs and representatives as well as with Treaty bodies."
"The European Union will reinforce its efforts towards achieving the United Nations Secretary-General's goal that the rights of all men, women and children must be 'at the heart of every aspect of UN work'."
"Before addressing the preparations for this year's Commission on Human Rights, I would like briefly to address the outcome of last year's session, because it is indicative of the challenges that we face next March and April in Geneva."
"The 2003 session of the Commission was challenging."
"The beginning of the session was overshadowed by the looming war in Iraq."
"The war started during the Commission's second week yet, and quite remarkably, the atmosphere, while occasionally fractious, was a significant improvement on the atmosphere of 2002."
"There was a more positive approach by all groups on a number of issues which had previously caused serious difficulties, most notably the follow-up to the Durban World Conference against Racism and on the rights of the child."
"The return of the United States to the Human Rights Commission was another positive and welcome development."
"The European Union played a positive role at the Human Rights Commission."
"On individual country situations, the Union successfully tabled resolutions on the human rights situations in Burma (Myanmar), the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Turkmenistan and North Korea."
"The Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories."
"The European Union also agreed a Chair's Statement on Colombia."
"However, initiatives from the European Union on Chechnya and Sudan were defeated and our resolution on Zimbabwe fell to a no-action motion."
"It also reflects the unwillingness of some regional groups to accept any condemnation of their members. It also reflects the very large number of proposals coming forward from the European Union."
"Turning to thematic resolutions, the EU initiatives on the death penalty and the rights of the child were adopted by the Human Rights Commission."
"One of the more emotive issues addressed by the Commission, a Brazilian resolution on human rights and sexual orientation, co-sponsored by the Union, ran into vigorous objection, in particular from the Organisation of Islamic Conferences."
"This issue was remitted to the 60th session of the Commission and it is likely to be very sensitive in the upcoming session."
"Before turning to the EU's preparations for the forthcoming Commission, I wish to mention the decision by the African Group in Geneva to challenge the nomination of Australia as Chair of the session."
"In line with the current system of geographical rotation, the Western Group has nominated Australia as its candidate for Chair of the next session of the Commission on Human Rights."
"The African Group in Geneva has indicated that it intends to call for a vote."
"We are very concerned about this development and its negative impact on the Commission on Human Rights."
"Australia enjoys the full support and the endorsement of the European Union and of all other members of the Western Group."
"Accordingly, the European Union has called on the African Group to reflect on its decision in advance of the election, due on 19 January 2004."
"I hope that the African Group can be dissuaded from calling for a vote on the Chair of the Commission."
"In making this call, I am guided by the need to work constructively with the African Group at the forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights and to improve relations with the Group generally in that forum."
"The President of the Council has already made our anxiety clear to move Africa up the agenda of the EU, so there is no question as to our goodwill on this issue."
"Against the background outlined above, I would like to give you as much information as I can about the current state of the Council's preparations for the Commission on Human Rights."
"Time does not permit me to touch on every aspect of the Commission's work."
"However, I wish to share with this Parliament the essence of our approach as a presidency."
"At a general level, the Human Rights Working Group, COHOM, has been working since last autumn on improving the Union's performance, based on our experience from last year's session."
"The first meeting of the Human Rights Working Group of the Irish presidency will take place on 21 January."
"In advance of that meeting, the various Common Foreign and Security Policy geographical working groups have been asked to present their priorities and their recommendations for action this year."
"With the help of this input, the Human Rights Working Group meeting on 21 January will identify countries which may have formed the subject of EU initiatives at this year's Commission."
"COHOM is also likely to request detailed reports from EU heads of mission on human rights situations in these countries."
"I should stress that no final decision on any initiative has as yet been taken."
"The Human Rights Working Group will take a final decision at a further meeting to be held on 4 February."
"If there are any particularly controversial issues outstanding, these will be considered by the Political and Security Committee and, if necessary, be decided by the Council at Council level."
"The expressions of the Union's concern in regard to the human rights situations in countries will not be confined to formal resolutions."
"In the traditional statement under agenda item 9 – human rights situations in various parts of the world – the EU will refer to a number of country situations in the context of the thematic approach."
"The presidency intends to keep this draft as concise and as targeted as possible."
"We believe that by doing so we will have the maximum impact."
"Another effective approach is the type of human rights dialogue that the Union has entered into, for example with China and in the EU-Iran dialogue."
"As regards thematic resolutions, again no final decision has been taken."
"However, the European Union is again likely to table resolutions on the death penalty and on children's rights."
"Preparations have also begun for a number of EU statements, including one on the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights and others on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, the right to development, economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights, integration of the human rights of women and the gender perspective, the rights of the child, contemporary forms of slavery and human rights defenders."
"This list is by no means exhaustive."
"It does, however, give you some indication of the very thorough engagement which is envisaged by the European Union in this year's Commission on Human Rights."
"The timing of this session for Parliament is very welcome because it means that the Human Rights Working Group will be in a position to take into account the deliberations of this Parliament in framing the Union's priorities for the Commission."
"The European Parliament's suggestions for initiatives are most welcome and I will be very attentive to any suggestions that come forward here today."
"A major aim of our presidency is to achieve a fruitful and an effective session of the Commission."
"The climate of confrontation, which increasingly characterises debates in the Commission on Human Rights, is a problem which we will address with our partners."
"It is a problem that must be resolved, a distraction that the Commission on Human Rights does not need."
"The actions of the European Union in the field of human rights are clearly perceived by part of the international community, for some reason, as being suspect."
"Unfortunately, the very principle of universality of human rights and the conviction that they cannot be constrained or limited by any social, economic or cultural exception are being called into question."
"Ireland will work very hard to counter this perception of the EU stance during our presidency."
"I would like to conclude by reiterating the important and central position of the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Union's external relations policies."
"Peace, security and international stability are founded on full respect for human rights."
"This is not empty rhetoric; it reflects the objective recognition of a reality that should be clear to all."
"It is also a reality that is destined to have an ever more decisive influence on governments' external policy choices."
"It must also inform the strategies of international organisations."
"In conclusion, I wish to thank Parliament for the opportunity to outline the Council's preparations for the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and to look forward to further developing the dialogue between the Council and Parliament in this vital area, which is so close to the heart of all democrats."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes this opportunity to exchange views with Parliament on the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"I subscribe wholeheartedly to the statement that has just been made by Minister Roche."
"We need to fully guarantee the coherence between respect for human rights internally in the European Union and the central role that human rights play in our own external policy."
"The Commission would like to contribute to this debate on the basis of some of its specific points of view."
"As Mr Roche just mentioned, the Commission on Human Rights of the United Nations is no stranger to controversy."
"In the statement on the CHR preparations delivered on behalf of the Commission to Parliament last year, Commissioner Nielson noted that Eleanor Roosevelt, the first Chairman of the CHR in 1946, would be turning in her grave at the election of a Libyan Chair."
"To that sorry saga we must now add the African Group’s provocative indication that they will request a vote, and vote against, the Western Group’s nominated candidate for Chair – Australian Ambassador Mike Smith – which can only serve to embitter the atmosphere in Geneva ahead of the 60th session."
"Even by the standards of an increasingly politicised CHR – a body which saw fit to reject last year’s EU resolutions on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Sudan – this is an unprecedented move."
"The Commission supports the swift efforts of the Irish presidency to mobilise a concerted EU and Western Group response, with a series of démarches in African and Asian capitals."
"A final decision on the European Union’s country and thematic initiatives has not yet been taken and consultations continue between the Council Working Group on Human Rights and geographical working groups."
"As the European Parliament’s Annual Report on Human Rights noted last year, the European Union is one of the most active players at the Commission on Human Rights."
"The EU cannot carry that burden alone, and the search for goodwill and burden-sharing with members of the Western and other groups is vital."
"The EU must make best use of the revitalisation of the United States' interest in both the General Assembly Third Committee and the Commission on Human Rights."
"Whilst acknowledging that EU and US views diverge sharply on several issues, the successful cooperation on the resolution on Turkmenistan last year shows that playing to the strengths of our relationship with the United States can pay dividends."
"Cooperation with Latin American countries – not least on the omnibus resolution on the rights of the child – stands as a good example of partnership with other groups."
"Moreover, Brazil’s courageous, and inevitably controversial, decision to table a resolution on sexual orientation – an issue which will be re-visited this year – also demonstrates the value of encouraging important human rights initiatives from other players."
"The potential success or failure of draft resolutions cannot, of course, constitute the primary factor in decisions on EU action."
"The very act of tabling a resolution sends a strong signal of concern and the situation of human rights on the ground must be a pivotal consideration."
"That said, in rejecting entirely justified resolutions, the Commission on Human Rights is falling far short of fulfilling its mandate to promote and protect human rights."
"Such resolutions do not only stand as a mark of the international community’s preoccupation with a particular country’s human rights record; they provide the basis for the work of country and thematic rapporteurs, charged with the investigation of human rights concerns."
"It is a mark of the lightness with which certain members of the Commission on Human Rights carry their responsibility to the institution that 35 of the 53 state members have failed to extend a standing invitation to those rapporteurs and other visiting mechanisms."
"We must make every endeavour in our dialogue and cooperation with such countries to prompt a more acceptable approach."
"That is entirely in line with the EU’s determination to draw on the work of the Commission on Human Rights as an important element of our relations with third countries, to ensure that the approach we take throughout the year is consistent with what goes on in international human rights fora and to ensure that the mainstreaming of human rights in external relations is a meaningful process."
"The Commission therefore welcomes this debate."
"We consider it an important contribution to the building-up of the EU position in the forthcoming session."
"I shall conclude by underlining the Commission’s intention to extend every assistance to the Irish presidency during what will undoubtedly be a challenging year for the EU in the Commission on Human Rights."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, every year, we have this human rights debate immediately before the UN Commission on Human Rights meets in Geneva, and every year we are able, in fact, wholeheartedly to endorse what the Commission and the Council have to say."
"The fact is that the principles that we proclaim are common to us all and there is no doubt in anybody’s mind that we give them our full support."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has quite rightly said that human rights are an indispensable requirement if peace, stability and prosperity are to be secured."
"That, though, brings us on very quickly to the deficits, and the Commissioner has stressed that the Human Rights Commission does not really use its opportunities in the way that it could."
"I believe that the Irish presidency does honestly want to make action for human rights a keynote of its presidency."
"This is something for which Ireland has a very good record; it has produced such outstanding figures as Mary Robinson, who have distinguished themselves in this area."
"With reference to something else – the Constitutional Treaty – your Prime Minister said today that he wants to do his best, but that he is not alone."
"Where human rights are concerned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are indeed, unfortunately, not alone."
"The chairman of my group said something on this subject this morning, to the effect that it would be a good thing if action for human rights in major States were to be given some substantial expression, that is, in joint communiqués."
"According to the old Prussian principle of administration that ‘government is done in writing’, that which is not on file does not exist, and if, in your dealings with Russia or China, you discuss things behind closed doors without mentioning them in a communiqué, then – politically speaking – nothing has happened."
"I therefore ask you, when you represent the European Union at meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights, to support resolutions on China, on Russia and also on Iran."
"I am the rapporteur on Iran and believe that the present situation makes it necessary that we do this."
"Let me draw on a proposal by the House dating back some years and advise you not to concentrate on our 15 or 25 Member States, but to act in concert with all the democracies that sit on this Commission, consulting with all the functioning democracies around the world and coming to agreements on what your common concerns are."
"Turning to the Africans, one cannot but wonder what they actually want: appreciation on the one hand for the way in which they are establishing high standards under NEPAD, the new programme for African development, and for even establishing the peer review mechanism that we spent yesterday evening discussing, but when it comes to getting practical, they shy away, even objecting to Australia assuming the presidency – probably because Australia has taken a high-profile line on Zimbabwe."
"I regard all that as highly dubious, and we have to ask ourselves what we are going to do with the Africans."
"I said yesterday that I am very much in favour of us supporting those who do something practical in defence of human rights, but, contrariwise, that also means that we have to impose sanctions on those who do not."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is naturally very pleased to see that the Council and the Commission are taking its opinion into account before the Geneva session."
"During this term, it has expressed several concerns that it hopes will be reflected at the session, and I would just like to mention five of them."
"The first is ensuring that human rights are not subject to double standards."
"A failure to condemn flagrant violations of human rights in major powers such as China – torture, disappearances and the death penalty – Russia – with Chechnya – and the United States – with Guantánamo – would be unacceptable to the public."
"Large and small must be in the same boat."
"The second issue relates to the European Union’s decisions: its votes must reflect the concerns that Parliament has expressed in its annual reports and its resolutions, in particular with regard to strengthening international law as a guarantor of human rights in the world."
"Parliament has on many occasions highlighted the importance of ensuring that every country adopts the international conventions on the abolition of the death penalty, torture and antipersonnel mines."
"It has regretted and strongly criticised the pressure the United States has exerted on certain countries to force them not to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"Moreover, it has emphasised specific topics such as violence against women and children in particular, which you mentioned as one of the thematic issues."
"The third concern is that condemning terrorism and countries that shelter terrorists must go hand in hand with condemning all of the abuses and violations of human rights perpetrated today in many countries in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"This fight is certainly important, but it must not flout international law nor infringe upon human rights."
"This concern of the European Parliament, highlighted in its resolution of January 2003, will be clearly reflected in the 2003 report on human rights in the world, for which I am rapporteur."
"The fourth issue, the right to reproductive health, which covers all of the services relating to sexual and reproductive life, was also given priority in that same report."
"I need not remind you that maternal and infant mortality, epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases and deaths following illegal abortions are the cause of more deaths today than any armed conflict. These tragic and unnecessary deaths continue to be the lot of the Developing World, and Africa in particular."
"We hope that the Council and the Commission will give a very firm commitment in relation to this right to reproductive health."
"Fifthly and finally, the European Parliament welcomes the coordination between the Commission and the Council and hopes that this will continue."
"As in 2003, it would like an delegation to be able to attend the next session in Geneva."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, representative of the Commission, I believe that it is a pleasure for this Parliament to be able to hold this debate on the preparation of the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"Human rights are a priority issue, which must be applied in a universal and indivisible manner, regardless of the cultures on which each country is founded."
"I was extremely pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say that human rights were going to be a key element in the Irish Presidency’s work."
"I am also pleased to hear that the European Union must not just defend human rights with a view to exporting them, but that there must also be work to ensure that human rights are always protected and respected in the various States of the European Union."
"In this regard, loutish acts of racism and xenophobia, or those associations that advocate certain cultural identities, must be completely outlawed."
"I would also point out that, since the European Union is a continent with a significant amount of immigration, it is possible that some of these actions will be directed at immigrant groups."
"Since I cannot naturally refer to all the points that I believe must be argued at this session in Geneva, I will just refer to three specific ones: firstly, the issue of Cuba, where illegal detentions are taking place, specifically for crimes of opinion; in this regard, guaranteeing freedom of expression, of association and of meeting is a priority issue."
"The European Parliament awarded the Sakharov prize to Oswaldo José Payá in 2002 and I believe this is an issue that we must be concerned about."
"Secondly, on that very island of Cuba there is Guantánamo."
"I am not going to go too far into this, but there are 700 people there, awaiting trial in a situation which is legally indefensible."
"Finally, there are also other countries such as North Korea where people are being imprisoned in situations that we can only condemn."
"I myself have lived for many years in a country in which human rights were not guaranteed and I believe that the European Union must be committed to defending these rights here and throughout the world."
"Mr President, here at the beginning of 2004 the climate of obsession with security has become more pronounced."
"The fight against terrorism is now held up to justify any repressive, authoritarian or discriminatory measure. Freedom of expression and freedom of movement, indeed all democratic rights at times, are suffering in many countries, including under George Bush’s administration, which has just established a specific procedure for officials of airline companies from 10 countries to enter American territory."
"Throughout the world, there are also numerous examples of an offensive against those men and women who campaign tirelessly for human rights."
"In anticipation of the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, I would like to mention a few of them."
"I am thinking of Sihem Bensedrine, a writer, journalist and former spokesperson for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, who was attacked in the middle of the street a few days ago in Tunis on her way home."
"A group of 15 lawyers lodged a complaint on her behalf and Sihem Bensedrine blamed, and I quote, ‘the political police’."
"As usual, the Tunisian authorities rushed to deny the existence of any such police."
"The many recent interventions by this courageous and passionate campaigner to denounce breaches of human rights in her country in the European media, before a parliamentary committee in Germany or even when her last book came out have certainly not seemed to please the Ben Ali regime."
"The harassment suffered every day by Tunisian human rights defenders shows that the Tunisian regime has not made progress, despite the shocking statements to the contrary made by the French President, Mr Chirac, in Tunis in December."
"On the contrary, freedoms as fundamental as the freedoms of expression, of opinion, of association and of assembly continue to be violated every day, treating the European Parliament’s repeated requests with disdain."
"This assessment is also shared by Mrs Hina Jilani, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders."
"In my view, the European institutions, the Council and the Commission, must shilly-shally no longer and must, at the session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and in general, assert an unambiguous position regarding this regime and use their influence to demand respect for all freedoms."
"The credibility of the EU-Tunisia links must measure up to this requirement."
"We welcome the very recent release of political prisoners in Morocco, and in particular that of the journalist Ali Lmrabet and several Sahrawi prisoners who had been in jail for many years."
"Their release is proof of the importance of international solidarity."
"I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate and by the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan to Brussels to receive the Sakharov Prize to reiterate demands that have already been stated here but which are still relevant."
"I would like to talk about the issue of Western Sahara and to call on the governments of the Member States to give their full support to the current efforts of the United Nations."
"As the deadline has been set for 31 January, there is an urgent need to put pressure on Morocco to accept, as did the Polisario Front so courageously, and to implement without any further delay the UN peace plan, which at last provides for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people through a free and democratic referendum."
"The Council and the Commission have the resources to help bring this about."
"Finally, I would like to mention the situation in Palestine."
"The people of Palestine have had enough."
"Every gesture of goodwill, like the Geneva peace initiative adopted by Israeli and Palestinian leaders, is immediately scorned, to say the least, by Sharon."
"Accusations of treason, the circulation of black lists, fatal shootings by the Israeli army in the Occupied Territories and the sentencing of young, refusenik soldiers are just some of the blows to the very idea of peace in the Middle East."
"The escalation continues to be dangerous and bloody."
"In this respect, I can only welcome the beginning of the next session of the Court in The Hague, which is due to give a ruling on the legitimacy of the ‘wall of shame’."
"However, as regards condemning breaches of rights, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the European Union must assume their responsibilities."
"– Mr President, 2003 was an exceptionally gloomy year for international human rights."
"The year began for me in South Africa, where I was working for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which had been investigating the legacy of apartheid, and I would not want to see inequality, racism or discrimination on anything like the same scale ever again anywhere."
"We are now, however – real or imagined terrorism having become a factor in any analysis of the world order – in real danger of sliding towards global apartheid."
"As we happily swear by the notion of multilateral security based on cooperation, the European Union, as a Community of values and in its human rights work, which has a key impact on security, has been a disappointment in terms of practical work in this area."
"Amnesty Internationalpublished a report this week called, in which EU human rights policy came in for some heavy criticism."
"Amnestycomplains, for example, that the governments of the Union’s Member States often do not even take the trouble to reply when it contacts them."
"We, too, however, have experienced the same sort of frustration in relations between the European Parliament and the Council."
"Major violators of human rights, such as China and Russia, just get away with it year after year."
"Parliament’s expressions of concern have in these cases, as in many others, come to nothing on account of the passive attitude of Member States, differences of opinion between them, and the commercial and other sordid interests they have lurking in the background."
"Good intentions, both in the thematic and geographical sense, therefore often remain inexcusably empty, futile gestures."
"What is needed is muscle and effect: I refer here for example to statements on human rights and democracy."
"The country holding the presidency, Italy, at any rate chose children’s rights as its theme for its human rights forum."
"With respect to these, one nevertheless fears that the guidelines for children and armed conflicts agreed in December will not be effectively implemented, as was the case with the action programme against torture before it in 2001."
"The new European security strategy will, meanwhile, remain without any sustainable content unless it is anchored to a consistent, coherent and credible human rights policy which the Council also wholeheartedly embraces."
"All eyes turn now to Ireland."
"Unless there is a wind of change both in our bilateral relations and in the United Nations we will have to prepare, not just for a combination of virtual farce and disaster, such as we saw at the fifty-ninth sitting of the Commission on Human Rights, but also for the fact that we will be wasting what is historically a golden opportunity right now when our work could have crucial, not to say epoch-making, importance."
"– Mr President, as Mr Ahern reminded us this morning, respect for human rights lies at the core of European politics."
"Despite all the Union’s efforts, however, human rights are still being violated in too many areas, not only in the rest of the world but even within the EU itself."
"Trafficking in human beings, trafficking in organs, new forms of slavery that demand our attention in the third millennium, the unregulated use of the Internet that all too often breaches our countries’ laws and becomes a vehicle for paedophilia, for the trade in human beings and for spreading information among terrorists who have no respect for human life and dignity – these are just a few of the many examples we could give."
"We must call on the United Nations to ensure that rights that are violated in so many countries today are respected."
"The children that are forced to work or become guerrilla fighters in order to survive are also those children who in our rich societies see their images and their bodies used for commercial activities, in violation of the rights that their age confers on them."
"Too many words and statements have been uttered in reaction to urgent situations which actually require strong political decisions, such as the decision to stop the use of children to advertise or promote income-generating activities, and the decision to make certain economic relationships with third countries conditional on respect for human rights."
"Those countries that do not have a secular system but one based on enforcing the , with everything that that religious law entails in violation of human rights, should be made to face clear decisions by the Union and the international community."
"Although cooperation remains a way of getting closer to the population, maintaining normal economic relations with governments that breach the principle of human rights would be wrong and would clearly contradict all the fine words we have uttered in recent years."
"We ask the Irish Presidency, with the support of Parliament, to put forward the need for stronger and more political statements at its next meeting with the United Nations."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to ask the Council and the Commission to put the situation in Vietnam on the agenda for the coming 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"A picture of growing government repression in Vietnam emerges from several reliable sources, some local and this applies even more to the second half of last year, 2003."
"To illustrate this, I should like to give some details of the national situation."
"Even official figures show a doubling in the number of death sentences in 2003 compared to 2002, particularly for drugs and economic crimes."
"In addition, citizens are being arrested on allegations of spying or criticising the government on the Internet."
"The Protestants in Vietnam’s central highlands are undergoing particular suffering. They are subject to constant ethnic and religious persecution, including the ultimate government sanction of deprivation of their livelihood, their land."
"Incidentally, Hanoi has strictly forbidden these hill tribes to maintain contact with the outside world."
"Gatherings of more than two people are also prohibited."
"It is no wonder that these people, known as Montagnards, are attempting to flee their heavily militarised territory, which is resulting in a refugee crisis."
"All in all, we are seeing shocking breaches of human rights here."
"Council and Commission, I trust that you will call the Vietnamese authorities to account for these matters via the global forum ofthe UN Commission on Human Rights."
"It is of practical importance that the United Nations demand that Hanoi grant their special rapporteurs for freedom of religion or belief and for refugees access to the central highlands."
"The Council and the Commission should push for this promptly in Geneva too."
"– Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I am grateful for the information, but I should like to ask a question, make a comment and lastly, perhaps, make a proposal."
"The question is this: do we agree that, when we speak of ‘human rights’, we also mean civil and political rights?"
"In other words, do we agree with the position of Kofi Annan, who recently declared that democracy is a human right in itself, as can be inferred from Article 21 and others of the Universal Declaration?"
"The question I am asking is a very important one, and one that also arose from a conference on democracy and human rights held in Yemen a few days ago, organised by , at which fifty countries from the Arab world released a statement that very clearly affirms this."
"The second point is a comment: the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is, of course, not only a recent instrument – it was founded in 1993 – but also a very weak one, and precisely because of its weakness it has become extremely politicised."
"It is a body that never has sufficient, clearly defined financial means, not to mention institutional powers or human resources."
"In short, it is at best a whistle-blowing body, but one which even in these terms has never done its job properly, precisely because it is composed of opposing blocs in which everyone protects the members of their own regional group."
"Commissioner, while it is quite right to be concerned about the African Group’s questioning of Australia’s nomination as Chair, it must be added that it is also true that last year Europe abstained on a call for a vote against the nomination of Libya as Chair on regional grounds."
"Perhaps it is worth remembering this, Commissioner and Minister, because if we had adopted a clearer position last year – not as regards the Chair’s country of origin but as regards the standard of application of human rights in that country – perhaps today we might have some extra cards in our hand with which to support the Australian candidate."
"Lastly a proposal: I do not believe we can make any further progress with simple, albeit necessary, criticisms towards various countries, from Tunisia to Vietnam, and we could add a whole list of names."
"I believe the problem is to strengthen the institutions responsible and thus the policies."
"For instance, I still do not understand – and I have been asking this since 1995 – why the European Commission does not have a Commissioner for human rights."
"It is a complete mystery to me, and nobody has ever given me an answer."
"Finally, I believe that the episode of the Australian candidacy itself reinforces the need to create a community of democracy and of democracies within the United Nations."
"Only a strengthening of the institutions can make a policy progress from words to deeds; so far there have been plenty of words but certainly very few deeds."
"Mr President, respecting, promoting and safeguarding human rights is one of the cornerstones of European integration."
"The Union therefore has the moral obligation and responsibility to defend and promote fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Consequently, we have the obligation and responsibility to improve the operation of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to make it the world’s political conscience, and I am pleased with what has been said here in this regard."
"It also has the obligation and responsibility, however, to condemn with great clarity and courage the violations of these rights which are taking place, wherever they happen and regardless of the economic or foreign interests existing between the European Union and the countries where these violations take place or the motivations leading to the violation or jeopardising of fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Rule of Law."
"Not to do so means covering them up, becoming accomplices in them, accomplices in what is happening in Chechnya, in Guantanamo, in Cuba, in Tibet or in Iran."
"In this way, the Union would also be clearly contradicting the principles and values on which it is based and would lose all credibility, and without credibility it will not have the authority necessary to promote and demand from others respect for the principles we claim to defend."
"It is not sufficient, however, to condemn."
"We must also implement the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and ensure that others implement them."
"Otherwise, our commitment will be purely rhetorical, and through rhetoric alone, however long the list of declarations adopted may be, it will be difficult for us to make a more humane world a reality for everyone."
"This morning, the Irish Prime Minister, on presenting the programme of the Irish Presidency of the Council, made a particular reference to the issue of human rights."
"The Geneva session offers an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that the words spoken this morning, which we have all applauded, truly respond to the will to ensure that the Union actively fulfils its commitment to the world to defend the fundamental freedoms which form the basis of the Community edifice."
"I am convinced, having heard what you have said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that that will be the case."
"– Mr President, we welcome the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council that there can be no compromises on the subject of human rights."
"Unfortunately, the experience of the European institutions shows that the reality is often quite the opposite."
"I should like to say a few words on two subjects on which I believe Europe should summon up all its political prestige and use it in Geneva."
"The first is the death penalty."
"The Italian Presidency’s about-turn on the resolution for a moratorium on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly, which was announced by the Presidency but never tabled, is a serious occurrence that has left the European Union exposed and, above all, has eroded some of its political authority. This shows that even on a subject apparently as widely agreed on and as precious as human rights and the abolition of the death penalty as a judicial solution we are held hostage to many governments’ petty self-interest."
"This is a battle that must be fought at a political level, starting in Geneva."
"In China last year 3 138 executions were recorded; there were also plenty of executions in many so-called liberal democracies, from Taiwan to Thailand, from Japan to India to the United States."
"We cannot address a matter like this on the slippery slope of political convenience and, above all, we cannot expect it to be a battle based purely on principle and evidence, because it is not like that."
"This is shown by the fact that the Governor of Illinois recently decided to commute 167 death sentences, and I believe it was because he felt the impetus and pressure of international public opinion."
"Another important point, Mr President, concerns journalists; in other words, the right to speak out and not to remain silent, which is a fair indicator of the real quality of a democracy."
"In the last ten years more than 400 journalists have been killed, and for very few of these do we have any legal certainty."
"In the last six months there have been 228 arrests and 250 unjustified trials, many of which were in countries that belong to the so-called group of western democracies; the latest case emerged only two days ago and involves Turkey."
"Among other things, we believe that the forces of repression against journalists and press freedoms have learnt to use more underhand methods."
"Violence against the freedom to speak out and not remain silent is committed and consummated also by gagging, censoring and taking broadcasts off the air; unfortunately, these are practices that have also recently found a place here in our countries, including my own country."
"In this respect we want to call on the Presidency to exercise a rigorous and courageous mandate, a political undertaking that I should like to try and define in the matter of human rights with just two words, which are the words Parliament has always sought to convey to the Commission and the Presidency: on human rights we will not tolerate any exceptions or any omissions."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam provided the European Union with a legal basis for taking action to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"That led to the adoption here a few years ago of a directive against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in employment and elsewhere."
"In the course of the enlargement process, we have consistently and successfully insisted that penalising sexual contact between persons of the same sex be abolished before a country could join the European Union."
"In this House, we have also repeatedly reminded countries such as Zimbabwe and Egypt, with which the European Union has concluded agreements, that they should put an end to discrimination and punishment of sexual contact between adults of the same sex."
"We make ourselves very clear on this point every year in our reports on human rights in the world and within the European Union."
"It is only logical, therefore, that we also raise this policy at the United Nations."
"As has already been said, last year, Brazil presented the UN Commission on Human Rights with an initiative to include combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the human rights policy of the United Nations."
"This year, that proposal will be further elaborated and then raised again."
"This elaboration will probably include mention of discrimination on grounds of sexual identity."
"That is a subject on which the European Court of Justice passed a landmark judgment just last week."
"My group hopes, therefore, that the EU delegation will support this Brazilian initiative in full – every last part of it – and also cooperate on elaborating it further."
"All further attempts to destroy this initiative by countries minded to do so must be prevented, in cooperation with at least the EU Member States that are members of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"Mr President, I too am pleased that we are holding this debate on the preparations for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"At long last it gives me an opportunity to remind our European Parliament of its commitments on the question of indigenous peoples and in particular on our institution’s dialogue with those too-neglected peoples and its representation to them."
"It is my duty, Mr President – and you know what I am talking about – to remind you again of our 1994 resolution on action required internationally to provide effective protection for indigenous peoples, which in fact called for the setting-up of an interparliamentary delegation composed of Members of this Parliament and representatives of indigenous peoples."
"After ten years’ hard work, the indigenous peoples have for their part succeeded in creating and organising themselves in an Indigenous Peoples’ Forum."
"On the Union’s side, however, we are more than discreet;"
"I would even go so far as to say we are not present. The proof is that neither the Council nor the Commission have made any reference to indigenous peoples and Parliament itself has still not arranged its delegation."
"We must remedy this lack of consideration for a question that nonetheless affects peoples on five continents."
"I shall therefore be proposing that the Union invest its resources and its will in organising the next Indigenous Peoples’ Forum jointly with the UN here in this place and in ensuring that the rights of these populations also remain among our priorities."
". Mr President, it is very hard to know where to begin."
"This has been a superb debate, and what has struck me listening to it has been the extraordinary range of issues addressed."
"As I mentioned at the outset, this debate is greatly appreciated by the presidency: it provides a timely reminder and an opportunity to exchange views with Parliament some two months before the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights opens in Geneva."
"Members of Parliament – including the last speaker – have, in making their meaningful and fruitful contributions, highlighted areas in which there is still much work to do."
"I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate and to assure them that the Irish presidency will see to it that the points they have raised will be brought to the attention of the appropriate Council instance as we prepare for Geneva."
"Members have cited a considerable number of country-specific issues, as well as several thematic issues, which need to be worked on."
"It would be invidious of me to select specific issues from among all those which have been commented on today."
"Let me simply say that my colleagues and I have been very careful to note the contributions and will ensure that we go through the record methodically."
"I would, however, like to refer to one point made by Mrs Bonino."
"The Union has been a strong supporter of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights since its establishment over a decade ago."
"Secretary-General Annan has yet to appoint a successor to High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello following his tragic death in Iraq."
"Let me assure you that this presidency will provide broad and strong support for the Office of High Commissioner at the Geneva meeting, not least because we owe it to the memory of the distinguished incumbent who was cut down in Baghdad, a man who did so much for the cause of human rights."
"I would like to end by again thanking the Members who have made contributions today."
"I can assure them that their contributions will be taken on board."
". Mr President, I would also like to thank Parliament for its contribution to the preparation of the European Union's position."
"A Member of Parliament raised the issue of the fight against terrorism and its impact on human rights."
"I would like to reiterate that the Commission is of the opinion that the European Union should support the Mexican resolution on protecting human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism, in the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"Concerning Tunisia I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Commission has recently published a communication on human rights in the Mediterranean, in which we clarified our position on the human rights situation in Tunisia."
"Third, I would like to associate myself with Mr Roche's remarks as he paid homage to Mr Vieira de Mello, the former High Commissioner for Human Rights, who was tragically killed in Baghdad."
"My last comments concern Mrs Bonino's remarks."
"I could even go as far as to say that I share her view."
"As you know, the Commission said last year that it would be a dangerous precedent to change the way the President of the Commission is chosen by replacing the concertation and acclamation procedure with a vote."
"Therefore we are prepared to support the efforts of the Irish presidency in avoiding making such a choice a source of conflict."
"Such a conflict cannot but undermine the credibility and role of the Commission on Human Rights, which is important for us."
"Finally, Mrs Bonino, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that last December the European Council decided to hand the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna, a specific competence concerning the guarantee of fundamental rights in the European Union, therefore creating the basis for what one could call an agency for fundamental rights in the European Union."
"When it comes to fundamental rights outside the Union, the responsibility lies with my colleague, Mr Patten, whom I am replacing today."
"When it comes to the internal policy of the European Union, I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am the Commissioner responsible for human rights!"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on 10 February 2004."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0445/2003) by Mr Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission on immigration, integration and employment (COM(2003) 336 – 2003/2147(INI))."
". Mr President, I am very proud to be presenting this report today."
"This report is unique in that it comes from the employment and social affairs side of this House and which for the first time tries the joined-up approach pioneered at the Tampere Summit."
"I am proud to be presenting it because it joins up the issues of immigration, integration, employment and partnership with third countries: many of the most sensitive issues that we deal with in the European Union, but also issues with which we must deal in a comprehensive way."
"Very often in this House we have dealt with these issues separately and they have been sensitive separately. Indeed, they are sensitive issues together."
"In this report I have tried to ensure the joined-up approach and have approached the whole task by trying to unify colleagues in this House around some key points."
"It is a key point that the demographic challenge that we face in the European Union of the future is one where immigration may be one solution, but not the only solution."
"We have some amazing statistics."
"In the 25 Member States, the working-age population is set to shrink from 303 million to 297 million by 2020, then to 280 million by 2030, almost doubling the old-age dependency ratio."
"It is the duty of this House to deal with these kinds of statistics."
"We cannot plan for the future and expect that immigration is not one of those solutions."
"If immigration is to be a solution, it must be joined up with the vital issue of integration."
"Integration is often an issue which is misrepresented."
"It is a vital issue."
"We are dealing in this report not just with new immigrants."
"People coming to the European Union for the first time to work may stay temporarily or they may stay forever."
"We are dealing in this report in a joined-up way with those ethnic minority communities in the European Union – people like myself and my family – who are settled in the European Union but who also ask Member States for solutions to discrimination to ensure that full integration really takes place."
"This involves the issues of citizenship requirements, language and a plethora of other issues relating to new immigrant communities, as well as settled ethnic minority communities."
"We should be proud in this House that for settled ethnic minority communities, we now have – through Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty – anti-discrimination legislation."
"There is so much in this report to commend to the House; it is difficult to name just one integration measure – there are so many."
"I urge the House and my colleagues across the House to look very positively at those integration measures for what they are."
"Where we look at more sensitive issues – for example partnerships between the European Union Member States and developing countries; family unity and immigration – I have also been very sensitive in this report."
"I have tried to bring together the whole House in agreement that Member States very often have the primary responsibility in these issues but that we should share best practice."
"That is vital because we are dealing with some issues which we know are politically charged and politically sensitive."
"The key achievement, I hope, in this report and the key achievement of the Commission communication was not to deal with these issues separately, or to pretend that they could be dealt with separately."
"It was to take a firm hold on the Tampere agenda, bring it back to this House, use the progress of the Greek presidency which took many of these issues forward, and try to create what I would call a positive agenda."
"I know that there will be some problems for some Members in this report."
"I have tried very hard to bring all parties together because this is a politically sensitive issue."
"Integration is something that should be the duty of all of us to move forward."
"For that reason, I realise there are some sticking points."
"I have done everything I can – for example on paragraph 32 and the right to vote – to bring the House together on these issues."
"Unfortunately, not all issues will be to the satisfaction of everyone, but I urge colleagues to look at the result of the vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs: 27 votes to 1, with 3 abstentions."
"There was a general consensus around many of these issues and in the way they were approached."
"I urge colleagues to vote positively and to think of the people who will be affected by this report, people who we represent: both new migrants who will perhaps become European citizens, but also people like myself who are now European citizens but look to being represented properly in a report which is moderate, comprehensive and should appeal to all sides of the House."
". Mr President, I am pleased to be here today to present the main aspects of the Commission communication on immigration, integration and employment, and would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on the excellent quality of his report."
"This very important Commission communication completes our response to the Tampere mandate and fulfils the pledge to examine the role of immigration in relation to the Lisbon strategy."
"The communication carries two key messages."
"The first – which has already been expressed in the Commission communication of November 2000 – is that, in the context of demographic ageing and decline, sustained immigration flows are likely and necessary if the European Union is to meet the Lisbon goals."
"Secondly, the full potential of immigration and its contribution to economic development can only be realised if immigrants are fully integrated both into the labour market and into society in general."
"Given the estimated speed of population decline from 2010 onwards and the results of the national survey conducted by the Commission, there is an urgent need to strengthen integration policies, as was called for by the European Council in Tampere and more recently at the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"The Commission is pleased that the rapporteur has laid the emphasis on the potential which migrants bring with them."
"It fully agrees that integration is a matter for society as a whole and that it is a two-way process, based on mutual rights and corresponding obligations, which implies that both the immigrant and the host society must adapt."
"I would also like to emphasise that we fully agree that we must ensure a European legal framework for the admission of economic migrants and that Member States must keep to the promises made in Tampere."
"The Commission has taken note of the difficulties encountered when negotiating in the Council the directive on admission for employment purposes, and is currently considering how best to approach bringing forward this politically sensitive issue."
"A Green Paper, followed by an extensive consultation procedure, is envisaged and we are also undertaking a study on the links between illegal and legal migration, which may provide pointers for the future development of a more coherent legal framework for the admission of migrants for employment purposes."
"Adoption of the directive on the admission of researchers is also envisaged for the very near future."
"Negotiations on the directive on the admission of students is now entering the core phase and I am convinced that this proposal too will shortly be adopted."
"The communication considers that, in order to ensure successful integration, there is a need for an holistic approach that takes into account not only economic and social aspects – these are very important – but also issues relating to cultural and religious diversity, civic citizenship, participation and political rights."
"The Commission is therefore pleased to note the specific attention paid in the report to the concept we put forward of civic citizenship and the need to promote a sense of belonging."
"A key condition for the successful implementation of an holistic approach of this type is that there should be improved overall policy coherence and synergies between immigration, integration and employment policies at all levels and across all disciplines and between all relevant actors, bearing in mind that prime responsibility for successful integration ultimately lies with the Member States."
"Finally, I would like to stress that I fully agree with, and welcome, the rapporteur's suggestion to establish programmes for the initial reception of persons arriving in an EU Member State."
"We are currently implementing the pilot projects in support of the integration of migrants."
"There has been enormous interest in these pilot projects and the programme has been oversubscribed to a factor of ten."
"We allocated EUR 4 million and applications have been made for more than EUR 41 million."
"Let me end by saying that I believe, and hope, that this communication on immigration, integration and employment will provide a basis for strengthening integration policy for immigrants, which will be crucial both for the development of the EU economy and for the promotion of social cohesion in the next few decades."
". – Mr President, I am standing in for the draftsman Mrs Terrón i Cusí, who had to return to Spain on a matter of urgency."
"The speech by Mr Vitorino and the report by Mr Moraes both seem to me to be fully acceptable, in view of the opinion adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which underlines the following points: the Council’s delay in adopting the legislative instruments presented by the Commission to implement the Tampere programme, a delay which, fortunately, was partly made up for in December with the adoption of the important directive on long-term residents; the need to retain a global view of immigration policy linked to employment policy and social integration policy; the usefulness of agreements with the countries of origin in order to guarantee the transfer of social security entitlements; the need to combat illegal immigration with repressive measures directed not against the illegal immigrants but against the traffickers who profit from them, and to combat illegal employment without discriminating against immigrant citizens; the usefulness of facilitating legal access for immigrants to the labour market so as to reduce demand and supply on the hidden market; the suitability of fighting discrimination and paying particular attention to the precarious situation of immigrant women."
"The opinion underlines in particular the usefulness of creating the form of citizenship known as ‘civic citizenship’, which enables third country nationals legally resident in the European Union to have economic, social and political rights and duties, including the right to vote in local and European elections, as the European Parliament has often requested."
"Only in this way will all workers and residents be able to feel that they are participants and jointly responsible for the future of the Community, sharing its values and contributing to its growth and to living together in peace and solidarity."
"Mr President, I would thank the Commission for using its communications constantly to provoke discussion of immigration as part of the EU’s response to the ageing population and the ever shrinking workforce, over and above the other aspects of Europe’s encounter with other cultures."
"These are controversial subjects in all the nation states, but it is high time we obtained analyses of the problems and challenges and proposals for common European solutions."
"I should next like to congratulate Mr Moraes on the report."
"It is a particularly relevant and necessary report right now."
"I am grateful for Mr Moraes’ having integrated the opinions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on the need to apply a gender perspective to immigration and integration policy."
"If this is not perceived as discriminatory, I also believe that this is due to Mr Moraes' particular background."
"If we are to succeed in creating a successful immigration and integration policy at European level too, it is absolutely necessary for a gender perspective to be applied at all levels."
"That is something of which I should like to remind the combined Commission once again."
"I am aware that Mrs Diamantopoulou and her Directorate-General are working hard on this, but it is necessary for you, Mr Vitorino, as her colleague, to do so too."
"Quite honestly, I find it just a little bit wearisome having to go on picking up the pieces of the Commission’s initiatives and ploughing the same old furrows."
"The headscarf debate is in full swing in many places in Europe at the moment."
"Should we not, however, be looking, rather, at a number of other areas such as better integration, the ways in which we enter into dialogue and the ways in which we give the women concerned power over their own lives."
"It might then be that the headscarf debate would solve itself."
"It is important that immigrant women who, as such, are bearers of a culture also be given opportunities without being totally disowned by their families because they want both to embrace their own culture and a European attitude of gender equality in society."
"If the women are not integrated, there is a danger of their sons or daughters not being so either and of their, in that way, being stuck in outdated gender roles which, in the Europe of today, are of no use in terms either of family life or of the labour market."
"Think of the emphasis that is now being placed upon the need today also for male managers to be able to incorporate feminine values into their management styles."
". – Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Vitorino’s statement that immigration is a two-way process which involves both rights and duties that have to be accepted."
"There are also other facets to this problem, amongst which we should certainly examine the issues of entry, housing and civil liberties; in short, integration into our European society."
"I believe it is a question, in this case at least, of turning these guest workers into citizens."
"What image of Europe are we projecting to the outside world, Commissioner, if, at the point of entry into the Union, the Schengen system, instead of helping to create an area of freedom, security and justice, is often gradually turning into a formidable instrument of electronic data collection and control?"
"Then there are the problems of housing, the head-in-the-sand attitude, the tendency – helped by the media – to focus our fears and turn them into spectres that have much to do with highly misunderstood aspects of the cultural identity of our societies."
"Thus we often have a reductionist image."
"The report, with which I fully agree, should perhaps in my opinion have developed certain aspects which are plainly set out in the Commission’s communication: civic citizenship; guaranteed core rights and obligations; respect for diversity; action to combat discrimination; women; family; civic, cultural and political life; participation; education; and, not least, religion."
"I believe these varied aspects have to be taken into account, particularly in view of the legal tradition and the humanistic values which form the heritage that is still shared by our society."
"Commissioner, Mr Moraes, we must reject the reductionist tendency of seeing immigrants merely as man- or woman-power, from a purely economic point of view."
"This attitude must be utterly rejected: these people must be regarded as human beings who enrich our society, not just in terms of their ability to create growth and well-being but above all as people who embody values and a human, spiritual and cultural identity."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on his efforts and the good work he has done on a report on immigration, integration and employment, which I believe deserves to be viewed favourably."
"These are issues that provide fertile ground for personal feelings and opinions, as well as for political temptations, and for that reason I wish to refer to the content of the Communication."
"Immigration is a reality that needs to be regulated, and we must not bury our heads in the sand or look the other way."
"In Europe, particularly in the countries with the lowest birth rate (Spain and Italy, amongst others), immigration is a necessary remedy."
"If the estimated population of the European Union of 25, as the rapporteur has said, is going to drop from 303 million to 297 million by 2020 and to continue to drop to 280 million in accordance with the estimate for 2030, the reduction in employment could have negative effects on economic growth, given that growth results from increased employment and productivity."
"For this very reason, immigration must not be seen as a problem, but as an opportunity."
"This is of course an opportunity, however, that raises certain problems which we must resolve."
"Without being exhaustive, I would point out the problem of the integration of foreign children, children of immigrants, into schools; that of inter-cultural coexistence in communities and workplaces; that of family reunification, with all the problems raised by the very concept of reunification in a broad sense or in a narrow sense; of the regulation of people without documentation; the fight against illegal immigration and the mafias which exploit it; in particular, the problem of the specific situation of women immigrants."
"In conclusion, immigrants are necessary, but how many can we accept?"
"Everybody who wants to come?"
"I think that is impossible."
"It would be like transferring the problems of the countries of the immigrants are trying to leave to some of the Member States."
"Bearing in mind that in the countries with very low birth rates, without immigration, the ratio between active and passive workers would become unsustainable in the medium term, I believe that the best approach is to integrate them."
"They represent workforce, but, above all, they are human beings who the Member States need."
"The Tampere proposals are therefore still valid: cooperation with countries of origin, a common European asylum system, management of migratory flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals."
"For those who each State can legally receive and with a view to their integration, I believe that the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights offers us the course to follow in its Articles 4, 5 and 14, or, which comes to the same thing, the prohibition of inhumane or degrading treatment; the prohibition of forced labour and the right to education."
"Since we are placing considerable emphasis on the idea of employment, more specifically, Article 15 states that the third-country nationals authorised to work in the territory of the Member States have the right to the same conditions as nationals."
"Article 20 lays down equality for people before the law."
"Article 21 prohibits all discrimination on other grounds, including on grounds of nationality; Article 23 guarantees equality between men and women in all areas, including employment, work and pay."
"The report by Mr Moraes describes situations and proposes measures which are generally acceptable in view of the situation of immigrants who are frequently disadvantaged in terms of pay, health and safety conditions at work, hours and illegal employment."
"In summary, often, in more cases than we would like, and we would like there to be no such cases, we are talking about exploitation."
"We said that the first means of integration was employment, naturally followed by cultural integration, but we must not forget that Article 1 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights tells us that, ‘Human dignity is inviolable."
"It must be protected and respected’, and talks about the dignity of all human beings."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group of the European Parliament, I should like to start by emphasising that my group expresses its full support for the text of the report that we are debating today."
"The Moraes report has remained precisely within the spirit and letter of the decisions taken at Tampere, expressly calling for a more dynamic policy to integrate immigrants, in the aim of granting rights and obligations similar to those which apply to the citizens of Europe."
"Of course, immigration policy cannot mean just guarding borders, it cannot only be identified with repressive measures, repatriation and readmission."
"The Europe of human rights and the Rule of Law needs to recognise the basic labour and political rights of immigrants, to recognise what they have to offer, their valuable contribution to the economic development of Europe."
"Of course, social integration makes no sense without recognition of political rights and obligations, in other words the right to vote and to be elected."
"I think that a huge moral issue is in the making with the position of numerous conservative Members, who gladly accept the exploitation of the manpower of immigrants, especially in jobs which Europeans have abandoned, and at the same time see them as a solution to the demographic problem, but who say nothing about recognising their political rights."
"Equally immoral is the stance of those who, with opportunistic and expedient positions and practices, feed xenophobia and racism in Europe in an endeavour to raise new Berlin walls in people's minds and conscience."
"Over the last ten years, my political group has been fighting for a more humanitarian approach to the problems caused by large waves of immigrants and refugees and we are fighting for a pluralist and multicultural Europe, for unity within our differences, where everyone will have their place and rights without discrimination and without notional walls between us."
"European integration, social cohesion and the Lisbon strategy will be unattainable objectives, as you too stressed Commissioner, without the full safeguarding and application of all the human and political rights which European governments have promised to guarantee."
"I should like to express my satisfaction, because I heard Mr Ahern this morning confirming that the promotion of human rights is one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency."
"Only if their rights are respected will people of different origins and cultures feel part of the society in which they legally live and work, bearers of rights and obligations with their say on their everyday life, work, education, language learning, housing, health services, social services, their cultural environment and their political activities."
"Parliament has repeatedly proposed full recognition of the political rights of anyone who has been resident in the European Union for five years."
"I should also be obliged, Mr President, if you would allow me, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to call for something which is missing from the Commission communication: the integration of the gender aspect in all policies relating to immigrants' rights."
"Women are the most vulnerable group and often the first victims of economic and sexual exploitation."
"That is why special measures need to be taken to combat discrimination and facilitate their integration into social and professional life."
"Such measures might be vocational training, childcare facilities, individualisation of their rights, counselling, specialist research etc."
"Mr President, anyone who has ever lived or worked in a different country or even in a town or city distant from home will have experienced some of the difficulties that may be encountered in moving from one environment to another."
"Such difficulties become even more important when the change in linguistic and cultural context is a major one."
"Yet history tells us too just how mutually beneficial migration may be, provided that it is appropriately managed."
"The Moraes Report tackles the issues in a way that is at once realistic, sensitive and robust."
"It makes practical suggestions."
"Experience in Canada has already shown a number of these to be effective in achieving desired outcomes."
"I am particularly grateful for the extent to which the report identifies problems for migrant women and measures to assist in resolving these."
"I am speaking too on behalf of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak."
"Unfortunately she cannot be here today, but she would like me to express her thanks for the support that her amendments received in committee."
"We rather regret that, given the degree of consensus the report achieved there, it has been opened up for amendments in plenary."
"That said, we can support the majority of them, either in whole or in part."
"We particularly support Amendment No 10, which makes the report more positive to enlargement, and Amendments Nos 7 and 12 on family reunification."
"We do, however, have major difficulties with Amendment No 4, which backtracks on the commitment already made in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Moraes for the work he has done to produce such a worthwhile report and express the hope that it gets the support it so much deserves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a follow-up to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, the Commission has drawn up various proposals to control migratory flows and to combat illegal immigration."
"The fact is, however, that the image of Fortress Europe that the European Union has generated, as a result of its profoundly restrictive immigration policies, stands in stark contrast to the real economic need for immigrant labour."
"This is why this Commission proposal presents immigration as part of the solution to the ageing of Europe’s population and to the decline in its active population."
"I deplore the fact that the Commission attaches greater importance to the economic and demographic aspects that lead to immigration than to the social and human aspects or to improving the living and working conditions of immigrants in the various countries of the European Union."
"The fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings cannot result in a repressive policy that targets illegal immigrants."
"It must instead target the traffickers and employers who exploit this situation."
"This is why we have presented a set of what we believe to be important proposals to improve the Moraes report, in the hope that they will be adopted."
"These include opposing the content of the Council directive on family reunification, which contravenes the fundamental right to live in a family and contains an unacceptable proposal to subject all immigrant children of at least two years of age to a test, before deciding whether they can join their parents."
"I would also highlight our appeal to Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, adopted by United Nations General Assembly Resolution No 45158 of 18 December 1990."
"In addition, however, the overwhelming majority of immigrant workers who do not have residence permits but who do pay taxes and social security contributions in their host country should be automatically legalised."
"We also hope that account is taken of the fact that the overwhelming majority of immigrants are citizens of third countries who emigrate to European Union countries to flee situations of extreme poverty in their country of origin and who must, therefore, be treated as victims and not as potential criminals."
"Lastly, I am sorry that the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats seeks to use the Moraes report to call into question established political rights, specifically the right of immigrant workers to vote in local elections to the European Parliament."
"Immigrants must not be viewed as disposable workers who can be thrown away after use."
"Immigrants, and women in particular, should be deemed worthy of reception conditions that respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and equal economic, social and cultural rights."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this very rich report, which covers a very wide area."
"Part of the problem that we see in the European Union is that certain Member States now see themselves moving from countries of emigration to countries of migration, and other countries are coming face to face with the fact that they have made a very bad job in terms of using the talents and skills of many long-term migrants and, indeed, second and third generation nationals, as they are now in some countries."
"In an ideal world migration should be a matter of free choice, not forced by circumstance, so we welcome the recognition in this report of the need to reduce the causes of forced migration."
"Whether people wish, by choice, to come and help us out with out labour shortages and our demographic problems will depend on the circumstances of their welcome and the treatment that they receive here when they are resident."
"I welcome Mr Pérez Álvarez's reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the positive position of many other speakers this afternoon."
"There are a number of issues concerning, in particular, the labour market and equal treatment, which form part of this will to come and work in the European Union."
"The Article 13 directives tackling the racism and discrimination faced by many migrant workers are extremely important, as are the issues surrounding access to the market itself and equal pay and working conditions – rather than the exploitation of cheap migrant workers."
"There is evidence in quite a number of European countries that certain industries rely very heavily on migrant workers whose status is often in doubt."
"We need to be very careful that the demands of our economy do not encourage the proliferation of poor working practices and the trafficking of workers."
"On the question of civic citizenship, we very much agree with that as it stands in the report."
"We support the current text, including voting rights."
"The UK experience, for example, is that a number of our local councils benefit greatly from the representation of first generation migrants."
"Mr President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating Mr Moraes in showing tremendous skilful diplomacy and good-humoured tact in dealing with what could be a very controversial and divisive issue, and finding common ground and a consensus between Members from the different political groups within this Parliament in an effort to move towards these common goals."
"It is important that he emphasised that this issue is within the competence of the Member States and that it is through cooperation and coordination, rather than direction and enforcement of individual acts of legislation, that the best results can be achieved."
"We are all presented with a common challenge on how best to manage migration flows and integration policies."
"We in the European Union are on the threshold of our largest enlargement ever, when we open our doors to ten new countries and ensure that this European Union can continue to give benefit to the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe."
"They have suffered for so long from lack of opportunity, lack of economic development and lack of political freedom and skills."
"We are also, as the Irish presidency announced today, emphasising the Lisbon Process to make Europe work to ensure that the people who get jobs get proper returns and protection for the jobs they are in."
"That brings us to the point which many Members have already discussed here today, that is, how best we ensure that those who are emigrating into the European Union are given the protection and opportunities to benefit from any economic growth or any social rights that are there."
"This is not an immediate process. This cannot happen all at once."
"Demographic changes are taking place in the Union at the present time which require us to get people from elsewhere."
"This idea of managed migration is an important response to the demographic and economic changes which are taking place."
"It is only by our acting in cooperation and coordination with those third countries – and I am delighted that the rapporteur was able to take on board my amendment on this – that we can ensure there is no cherry-picking of the best individuals from those third countries, that there is not a brain drain and that there is also benefit to the European Union."
"Despite what some Members may say in this Chamber here today, this is not an open door policy and should not be an open door policy."
"We have seen that where there is a lack of controls and where there is a lack of decision-making within Member States, we have problems with regard to racism."
"Most individuals fear change that occurs on a massive scale."
"With regard to women's issues, particularly protection for women who are illegally trafficked, each of us has a responsibility to stamp this out wherever it takes place."
"Wherever the illegal exploitation of immigrant workers takes place, it should be stamped out, highlighted and individuals should be named and shamed for the very negative impact it has."
"My last point is that tonight we will be discussing the employment and service sector, which is linked to this issue of protecting individuals."
"Mr President, as the son of immigrants, I, too, realise only too well that attention must be paid to the different facets of immigration: to the problems that have been highlighted, but also to the opportunities it presents."
"On the whole, I can endorse the report by Mr Moraes."
"I should, however, like to draw attention to the connection between the three vital issues that the rapporteur mentions in recital 1: the need for migration to the European Union, improved integration, and cooperation with countries of origin."
"First of all, I do not see that migration to the European Union is needed as a result of the ageing of the population."
"Whilst there are still labour reserves in the European Union, at all events, the recruitment of migrant workers cannot constitute a solution."
"I should like to comment on the second issue, too."
"It is true that we need improvements in integration."
"In the Netherlands, the debate on this is in full swing."
"However, as the rapporteur rightly says, integration is connected with a whole range of domestic factors."
"Examples are the social context, education and command of the language."
"Precisely because of this observation, a European policy cannot be effective, and labour migration and integration should be a national priority."
"Paragraph 28 calls for attention to the problems that can be an issue in the field of general and reproductive health."
"I recognise the need for this."
"I must emphasise, however, that the promotion of abortion is out of the question."
"I should be pleased to hear what the rapporteur was aiming at with this section."
"I am also of the opinion that extending the definition of ‘family’ in this context would not be conducive to the promotion of integration."
"This would increase the problem of integration instead of solving it."
"These comments do not detract from the need for cooperation with countries of origin, however, or for consultations among the Member States of the European Union."
"The need to improve the situation of immigrants and their place in the labour market is clear."
"Mr President, the report that we are now discussing catalogues Utopian views, which, like all Utopian views, will prove unworkable in practice."
"To begin with, migratory flows are not an inescapable reality, as the rapporteur says."
"Just because he and his political allies want it does not mean that immigration is an inescapable disaster."
"On the contrary, until further notice, Member States still have the right to determine for themselves who enters the country, when and under what conditions."
"Also, the fact that most governments are extremely lax in applying their own immigration and integration legislation does not mean that the population is in agreement."
"For example, there is by no means a popular democratic majority in favour of foreign nationals having the right to vote or in favour of new waves of immigration, as the report argues."
"In our opinion, as democrats, there can be no harm in stopping to think about this and taking it into consideration."
"After all, what legitimacy does a European Union have that takes decisions that are diametrically opposed to the will of the people?"
"The discussion on rights without obligations that unfortunately also finds expression in this report, has had its day."
"It has been superseded, and it is urgently in need of comprehensive evaluation."
"In the Netherlands, for example, a commission of inquiry has been set up to look into the current integration policy, and two governing parties have already come to the conclusion that the policy of cosseting has been a failure."
"The report does not say a single word about the socio-economic or social problems that currently exist."
"In Flanders, for example, unemployment among people of North African origin is four to five times that of the indigenous population, in relative terms, so that the question arises as to who actually has an interest in a new form of immigration."
"Also, what about the indigenous people who no longer feel at home in their own town, their own street, as it is?"
"What about the rise of Islam and the deliberate unwillingness to integrate?"
"None of this is mentioned, and therefore this report is, I fear, yet another waste of time and resources."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating both the European Commission and Mr Moraes."
"It is time that Europe stopped focusing exclusively on ways to limit flows of refugees and started making positive noises for once."
"Positive noises are necessary, because we already have a great many migrants in our countries."
"The last speaker rightly pointed out the extremely high unemployment among migrants."
"Looking at the EU figures for 2002, I see that the unemployment rate among citizens of the European Union is 7.1%, but is more than double that for non-EU citizens living in the EU: almost 16%."
"If I then look at my own country, the figure is 33.5%."
"That means that a third of immigrants are out of work."
"Looking at the government of those countries – and here it is not my intention to enter into controversy, but I should just like to say it, because the other side frequently enters into controversy – I see that countries with a left-wing government are by no means doing any better than those with a right-wing government."
"Incidentally, the same goes for the right to vote."
"I am always dumbfounded by the ideology that some people propagate in this Parliament, whilst in their own country, where they hold administrative power, they are unable to translate that same ideology into policy."
"The right to vote is not granted in any of those countries: you can put it in your memoranda or your documents as much as you want, but your governments do not want to grant the right to vote and nor do your parties."
"It is very easy, therefore, to come here and advocate it, no strings attached."
"I say this because I have tried, in a moderate way, to ensure that reference is made in the text to political rights without making a direct link with the right to vote."
"That is evidently still not enough for a large number of people whose countries have left-wing governments, although they cannot push it through in their own countries."
"Why am I now speaking specifically about employment?"
"I am doing so because work is the best means of integration."
"All the rest follows from this."
"I think that the European Union and our countries are paying too little attention to this."
"Those with a job have an income, can seek better accommodation and usually obtain legal status."
"They learn the language at work and can put their children through the education system in these countries in the normal way."
"Work is thus one of the most important possibilities for integration."
"Sadly, we note that the European Union is defaulting in that regard."
"I support the solution that is being proposed for the future, that is to say, that we manage migration on the basis of the work we are able to offer."
"That implies, of course, also giving the present migrants work and gearing this management not only towards future migrants."
"Looking at the EU figures, much remains to be done in this respect."
"I should also like to draw attention to another point."
"When it comes to highly qualified migrants – and here I am not especially talking about migrants from African countries, but those from the United States, for example – we never ask that they speak our language, because they end up in companies where the language of communication is English."
"That is so easy: it is assumed that highly trained people will know the language of the company."
"We make a great many requirements of less-skilled workers – soon they will have to take exams, too – making things very difficult for them."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating both the Commission and the rapporteur on a really excellent report on a very important subject."
"Without doubt, there is a lot of xenophobia and racism in our societies or, in any case, a fear of that which comes from outside."
"There is extensive mistrust."
"It is believed that people from other countries will come and take our jobs when, in reality, the situation is quite the opposite."
"Those who come from other countries have, to the greatest degree, contributed, and go on contributing, to the prosperity we enjoy."
"I can speak from my own experience."
"I was born after the war and grew up on a housing estate whose residents mainly came from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland."
"Approximately half of my neighbours had arrived as immigrants from other countries."
"They contributed to Swedish prosperity, just like everyone else."
"We should not have had the prosperity we enjoy today if these people, together with the rest of us, had not contributed to it."
"We are now in another position."
"We have, firstly, a refugee policy and, secondly, an immigration policy."
"We must develop the refugee policy together, and it must be based upon international conventions."
"Europe must be a refuge for people being persecuted and in danger of being killed in other countries."
"We must have a humane refugee policy for which we take joint responsibility."
"Immigration policy is something else."
"It concerns people who are not in danger of being killed in their own countries but who would like to come to Europe, both to obtain a better life for themselves and to contribute to our societies, as they, in actual fact, do."
"It is something they do already, and there will be a greater need for them to do so in the future."
"We know how demographic developments look, and we need growth, employment and prosperity in Europe."
"We need to increase employment in the future, and we need people to employ if we are to be able to cope with health care and the care of the elderly."
"We need people, including people from other countries, together with those who are already here."
"Unfortunately, the fact is that people who at present come from other countries become, in large measure, unemployed, and that is something we naturally should do something about."
"I am convinced that we need an immigration policy."
"Immigrants must be integrated as soon as possible."
"Integration policy is important, and employment comes with education."
"That applies especially to women, as Mrs Dybkjaer mentioned."
"It is important both for women’s own sake and in order that the next generation might be integrated into society."
"Allow me also to say one thing about the issue that has created some kerfuffle, namely voting rights."
"I have experience of the euro vote in Sweden where we applied the same rules as in local elections; that is to say, people from other countries were allowed to vote."
"They went to the polls in very large numbers."
"If they had been able to decide the outcome of the Swedish vote, Sweden would today have had the euro as a currency."
"They were supporters of the euro and were more European than other Swedes."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur."
"I will say, however and I do not say this to reproach Mr Moraes, or as a 'turf' issue that it is a sad comment on the perceived definition of justice and home affairs in the EU institutions – that is, law enforcement and tough borders – that it is the social affairs side which is given the full lead on issues of citizenship and non-discrimination."
"We must place these human rights issues within the justice framework, as well as the social policy framework."
"The insistence on local and European voting rights for legal immigrants is a key issue."
"How can we possibly expect them to integrate if they are denied civic and political participation?"
"An active approach to integration is overdue."
"The controversies over the wearing of the , the Muslim headscarf – or , as the French rather confusingly say – show how acute the arguments can be."
"The fascinating difference between, for example, French and British attitudes shows that there is no one definition of integration."
"What we should be clear about is that it does not mean assimilation."
"Integration is surely a two-way street in which all parties have to adjust to a dynamic and changing society."
"It is not a soft option; hard effort is needed not only from immigrants themselves – such as language learning and equality – but also from indigenous communities in accepting and learning from differences."
"Finally, I hope all of us here and I know Mr Moraes does his best will try to persuade our national governments to stop populist and mean measures that only collude with media hysteria."
"For instance, if asylum seekers were allowed to work, they could escape the jibe of being welfare scroungers, which is unfairly thrown at them and which gives such a bad start to their eventual integration if they get legal status."
"Mr President, since the economic system based on paid work became widespread, emigration has always served to provide the enterprises of the developed countries with labour."
"That is how US power was built."
"France, Great Britain and other countries would not have developed without the contribution of immigrants from their colonial empires or from poorer countries of Eastern Europe."
"Unlike the slave trade, these population movements were free; migrants were not chained or whipped."
"The hunger and poverty of their places of origin were enough to drive them to emigrate."
"Where that emigration was regulated, it was done to serve the interests of the capitalist enterprises, in other words, the big employers of the host country."
"In other words, this report is not dazzling in its originality."
"True, it proposes that modern wage slaves should be well integrated, and it even proposes positive measures for women, but their main purpose is to control them and adapt them to the needs of the labour market."
"What is new in this report, on the other hand, is the proposal for temporary immigration, which will allow big western capital to benefit from a workforce already trained elsewhere and therefore trained free of charge and to get rid of it once it thinks it no longer needs it."
"Well, that is an inhuman system because it is the market that decides instead of people and that situation will continue so long as the present economic system exists."
"What, however, the workers can and must be given in order to safeguard their collective interests, whether they are citizens or migrants, is a strict equality of rights so that the employers cannot set one against the other by introducing a competition that will be harmful to all."
"That is why we are calling for complete equality of civil and political rights for all who live and work on the Union’s soil, including the right to move freely, to leave and to return."
"We call, moreover, for the legalisation of the situation of all so-called illegal immigrant workers, who are only illegal because the authorities refuse to grant them papers."
"– Mr President, the Moraes report on the Commission communication on integration and employment is an example of how good policies can never be built on the basis of good intentions alone; a certain Machiavelli taught us that."
"In this case the good intentions are to move the integration issue forward along the lines laid down at the Tampere European Council."
"The report thus contains statements of intent that certainly make good sense, for instance when it suggests that the all too common and uncontrolled illegal employment of illegal and hidden immigrants is a direct incentive to illegal immigration."
"It then goes so far as to state, however, in these very words, that the current political climate regarding asylum and illegal immigration may be – just think of it! – a possible obstacle to creating cooperation on managed migration and integration policies."
"This is clearly a contradiction, which can only be accounted for by a highly ideological view of the migration issue, and we have had some pretty obvious examples of this in earlier speeches."
"This view can only lead to statements that lack any objectivity and any connection with reality, as for instance when the idea is put forward that combating illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings results in a repressive policy against immigrants."
"If anything, it is this partisan, ideological, misleading view that may lead to the distortion of the increasingly clear and well-defined objectives that have recently been identified and pursued by the European Union, especially during the Italian Presidency."
"I cannot agree with a view of civil citizenship that includes the right to vote in local and even European elections, through which the European Union should somehow take the place of the individual Member States in recognising one of the rights – the right to be part of the electorate – on which, in my opinion, in a true democracy only the people of Europe, and not the internationalist bureaucratic and technocratic superpower, can decide."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe it is important that, for the first time in this legislature – though a little late – we are holding a debate on the phenomenon of migration linked to two relevant and important issues: the integration of immigrants residing legally in the European Union – and I would stress the aspect of legality in the reception society – and the way this relates to employment opportunities, as an essential element of economic immigration."
"We are dealing with the important issue of determining the reception capacity of the Member States according to the needs of their labour markets, and we are doing so from two points of view: quantitative and qualitative."
"It is therefore crucial for governments to make realistic offers which are as far as possible in line with available jobs, temporary or permanent, which can be filled by means of migratory flows, which ultimately have the effect of balancing the European Union's demographic deficit."
"This would be of benefit to the Member States and the immigrants’ countries of origin."
"Furthermore, the problem is currently arising – with tragic results in many cases, as we are seeing – of the emergence of a hidden economy in sectors such as agriculture, domestic service and construction; an economy which is fed partly by illegal immigration and which leads to subhuman situations and conditions both from a strictly employment point of view and from a social point of view."
"This leads to the establishment of ghettos and communities which are entirely fragmented and that face serious problems in surviving in the host countries."
"Having said this, Commissioner, Mr President, we can spend every day holding seminars and meetings, and applying all our attention to multiculturalism and integration from a religious point of view, and other issues, which lead us nowhere unless we establish crystal clear conditions for legal and ordered entry which guarantee immigrants a job in the European Union and facilitate their reception and social, cultural and political integration."
"In short, Mr President, from a human point of view."
"With regard to the political aspect of integration, which has been subject to much debate today, I believe that our Group’s Amendment No 4 must be given particular attention by the other political groups."
"For example, how can we ask for the right to vote in European elections for immigrants residing legally – I imagine – in the Union, when they cannot vote, for logical and constitutional reasons, in the legislative elections of the State they live in?"
"That is, they cannot elect the governments of the Member States but they can elect that of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Left, allow me to say that this is a crazy proposal, and that the Groups supporting it must seriously reconsider."
"On voting issues, ladies and gentlemen of the Left, there must be no room for demagoguery."
"In any event, we can do nothing if we restrict ourselves to wishing to resolve this problem by making the European Union solely responsible, without demanding that countries of origin co-operate very actively in the ordered flow of their own immigrants, which would mean these countries having the necessary administrative structures to organise their migratory flows, also making it more attractive for their own workers to return and, naturally, preventing mass exoduses, as is currently the case in certain border countries or, also – let us not forget – from countries on the other side of the Atlantic, as a result of their economic, political and social instability."
"Mr President, the Commission’s communication on immigration, integration and employment starts with a hymn to immigration and goes on to describe all kinds of measures to encourage integration without ever asking whether any of it is materially possible and, in particular, what the overall cost will be for our societies."
"It is because of reports like this that the governments of the countries of Europe have for decades allowed themselves to be lulled into a false sense of security and they are now waking up to an enormous failure and a terrible mess."
"The Commission will bear its share of responsibility, which will be heavy."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, how a communication or document of this kind comes to be written in the Commission."
"Who contributes the ideas?"
"Are the national parliaments consulted?"
"Who, moreover, does the actual drafting?"
"Is it the offices of the Commission, or is some of the work subcontracted, which I dare not imagine?"
"These are vital questions because the Commission’s powers will soon be increased by virtue of the Nice and Amsterdam Treaties."
"Work should be done transparently so that people are not deceived."
"– Mr President, the number of people in gainful employment in the EU will decrease from 303 million to 280 million by 2030."
"As the birth rate is continuing to decline, while the number of pensioners increases, it is probable that there will be adverse effects, and not only on economic growth."
"Will increased immigration from third countries help here?"
"Which workers to accept is for the Member States to decide, and that is also in the interests of the countries from which they come, who often lose significant potential."
"Controlled immigration makes it possible to see who is coming onto the labour markets."
"There must be great sensitivity in approximating conditions of entry at EU level, and this must be done only progressively, using together tried and tested procedures in recruitment and admissions policies, as is stated in one of the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"On this I am in absolute agreement with Mr Hernández Mollar."
"There is a need for dialogue with the social partners, as well as with the authorities that are responsible for the local labour market."
"The Member States must act with far more agreement and far greater decisiveness if legitimate employment is to be permitted and illegal employment prevented."
"The fact is that the latter compels many workers to accept intolerable pay and living conditions."
"Immigration alone, of course, will not safeguard our social security systems."
"If, for example, there is to be any marked increase in the birth rate, both mothers and fathers need far better legal safeguards."
"All in all, we all need society to be more family-friendly."
"Better-qualified workers and an increase in the number of jobs are dependent on the labour markets and the education and training systems being reformed."
"Although our rapporteur, Mr Moraes, was willing to find consensus, and incorporated many of my amendments into compromises that promise to gain majorities, the new amendments originating from our PPE-DE Group appear not to be supported by a majority in his own group."
"As a number of Members have said, one key point is that each Member State is itself responsible for making its own local election rules."
"That must continue to be the case in future."
"Only citizens of the EU may vote in the elections to the European Parliament."
"Let us beware of eccentricities that amount to defamation."
"If there is no support for this position, some of us will find it very difficult to vote for the report as a whole."
"Mr President, I should like to offer the rapporteur my sincere thanks."
"It is customary practice to do this anyway, but I think that it is particularly fitting in this case."
"The reason is that the rapporteur has really tried to concern himself in particular with the position of migrants in the labour market."
"I believe that he has succeeded in this, but unfortunately not entirely, because others have presented all kinds of distracting amendments."
"I should like to mention Amendment No 13 in particular, which more or less states that anyone who has paid even a small amount of tax anywhere should have an automatic right to a residence permit."
"I think that it is impossible to speak about any part of this topic without taking as one’s point of departure that Europe, with 450 million inhabitants, cannot be a reception centre for ten times as many people living outside Europe."
"That is not possible, and if we refuse to accept this fact, things become very difficult."
"The rapporteur has of course accepted it, and hence speaks about ‘managing migration’."
"That automatically implies doing something about it, keeping the situation in hand."
"I think that that is very good, in itself."
"If people keep to it, this is a splendid report."
"I have a fundamental difference of opinion, therefore, with those behind me who have said that it is nothing but nonsense and flights of fancy."
"That is not true."
"The dangerous flights of fancy are to be found on the other side of this House, where people are seeking to grant rights that cannot be fulfilled."
"If we cannot provide employment, there is no sense in granting rights."
"This would make us like the rich people of old who had a beautiful view from their windows and cared nothing that the poor people had to live in slums, because that is where they went, after all."
"Anyone who wants that should say so."
"They must also come out and say that we should indeed take in everyone and only then look at the consequences."
"That is the problem that we have here in the background."
"The rapporteur has shown that he is aware of that."
"He has also shown that he is trying to prevent that."
"Unfortunately, however, there are still some people in his own party – and in some other parties – who copy those aristocrats of old who believed that everyone should simply be given rights but who were not themselves prepared to accept the logical consequences of this and, instead, left others to deal with them."
"That exacerbates the misery, as we can see in the United States, and we want to avoid that."
"There is absolutely no need for any talk of this."
"Finally, on the subject of European citizenship, the rules on this are laid down in the Treaty, and it is indeed strange to include this subject here in a couple of words."
"That would need a Treaty amendment."
"We have, however, declared ourselves in agreement with the Convention, which does not provide for this."
"It would be very strange, then, if we were to simply go and lay down rules on the subject here in this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are now discussing, on immigration, integration and employment, clearly delineates a multifaceted and topical set of problems that is not being addressed in the European Union or in any of the Member States."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council laid the foundations for immigration policy in the Union."
"Today, more than ever, greater priority must be attached to this issue, mainly due to the significant increase in the flow of immigrants to Europe in recent years, to the need to maintain Europe’s level of economic development given the growing demographic deficit, to the shrinking labour force and to enlargement and the changes to the dynamics of migration that this will bring."
"By way of illustration, Italy will need an annual influx of more than 6500 immigrants per million inhabitants, according to the United Nations."
"My country, Portugal, currently receives 400 000 immigrants, which represents 8% of the working population and in the next 50 years could see a 17% fall in its total population."
"Immigrants, therefore, represent a resource for the labour market."
"This is not their only purpose, however."
"Their rights cannot be separated from fundamental human rights."
"Each Member State must consequently, in coordination with the Union, set limits for migratory flows that match the needs of their labour markets and also provide a supportive, humane and integrated response to receiving those who seek us out in order to improve their living conditions."
"The Member States, therefore, face a common challenge; that of improving the management of migratory flows by improving integration policies towards new and established migrants, in an ongoing partnership with the countries of origin."
"Lastly, as regards the rights associated with citizenship, which must always be considered in this matter, we take the view that it would be premature and possibly going too far to grant immigrants the right to vote in European elections."
"Even in local elections, each Member State must retain the prerogative as to whether or not it gives its immigrants the right to vote."
"Mr President, I would like first to thank Mr Moraes, who has managed to address such sensitive issues as immigration and integration by drawing up what is, over all, a satisfactory report."
"In view of the new demographic challenges that the European Union will have to confront in a few years’ time, the Commission and the rapporteur are right to present immigration as part, but only part, of the answer for Europe."
"In view of the economic and social consequences of the ageing of the population, it is clear today that managed immigration will without a doubt avoid a slowing down in economic growth and a decline in our fellow citizens’ quality of life."
"However, I doubt that such managed immigration can take place, because obviously everyone aspires to a change of scenery and a better standard of living."
"Moreover, we sometimes encourage such flows by our votes;"
"I am thinking in particular of Mrs Lambert’s report, report 1481, which extends our entire social security system to refugees and immigrants."
"That being the case, we need a number of measures to facilitate and improve the reception and integration of aliens without penalising either the host country or the aliens who are moving lawfully on the territory of the European Union."
"One of the necessary conditions for successful integration is that immigrants should have access to the European Union’s employment market and we are all agreed on that."
"It seems to me premature, however, in the context of a report on employment and integration, to give third country nationals the right to vote in local and European elections."
"As my fellow Member, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, said, how can we imagine third country nationals voting in European elections when they do not have the right to vote in general elections in our countries?"
"As for local elections, each of the Union’s 15 countries currently has its own practice in the matter of voting rights – nationality based on parentage or place of birth – and it is unthinkable today to imagine that the same legislation could be applied to all 15 countries of the Union by a vote taken so stealthily."
"That is why I shall be voting for Amendment No 4, which notes that third country nationals have the right to vote in local elections in some countries but does not oblige the other Member States to do the same."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, for having made himself so available and for his willingness to work together, and I should also like to thank him on behalf of Mr Mantovani, who would have liked to be here and speak but was called back to Italy on a matter of urgency."
"The dynamics of immigration in the European Union should be seen as part of a framework that takes account of the benefits this brings to all the parties involved."
"The Irish Presidency also mentioned this point this morning."
"Migratory flows must be managed so that they serve the interests of both the host country and the country of origin."
"Management of these flows may in fact be a response, as has already been said, to the democratic and economic development of the Union."
"We now need to improve the integration of the immigrants – legal immigrants – who represent a resource, but the immigrant populations must in turn respect the fundamental values of their host countries."
"A proposal has been mentioned to guarantee citizens of third countries legally residing in the Union the opportunity to vote in local and European elections."
"It is clear to everyone that such a question should remain a matter of the strictest subsidiarity."
"I thank the rapporteur in particular for the compromise reached with the Member State governments on setting up a quota system for legal entry into their countries, and thus into Europe, to be offered to the countries of origin and of transit as one of the main incentives for negotiation and agreement on readmission."
"It is very important to get this kind of collaboration."
"In any case, this complex issue, together with preparation of policy on the management of migratory flows, must obviously be dealt with at European level as quickly as possible."
"The rights of migrants must be recognised, but only alongside a policy to regulate these flows, which has to be a strict one."
"In conclusion, Italy has the second highest number of immigrants in Europe and is the only country in Europe to have very long external borders to the east and to the south."
"The whole of Europe must take stock of the size and complexity of this enormous migratory and social pressure, because the real problem starts in Italy but is immediately and automatically transferred to all the other Community countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you a happy birthday."
"We are seeing an increase in illegal migratory flows, generally controlled by criminal networks that give misleading information to potential migrants, who end up forced to work in conditions completely different to those they were promised, which might even include physical and or mental abuse and breaches of their human rights."
"This is, therefore, an extremely welcome initiative and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, because he provides a balanced analysis of three fundamental and interlinked issues."
"Firstly, managing migratory flows."
"We must have a common immigration policy with common conditions and rules for the entry and residence of migrant workers, which must always take account of each Member State’s real labour and economic needs."
"It must be left to each Member State to assess and to decide whether it should increase its labour force, in what quantity, in what sector, bearing in mind its real needs and its capacity to receive and integrate these immigrants."
"We must fight against illegal migratory flows, allowing economic migrants to take advantage of clearly defined and transparent legal channels, in order to compensate for possible labour shortages in each Member State."
"The proposal for a directive on the admission of third country nationals for the purpose of employment must help to explain to potential immigrants the legal ways of obtaining the right to reside in the Union."
"It must also strengthen the fight against illegal employment and penalise in particular those that profit from it."
"Secondly, improving the integration of immigrants into the European Union."
"There must be a common approach that ensures the integration of third-country nationals into our societies, guaranteeing rights and obligations as regards residency, access to education and employment and ensuring that they are not subject to discrimination at the economic, social and cultural levels."
"My third and final point concerns the need for cooperation with the countries of origin, in order to increase their capacity for managing migration, which will also require agreements to be negotiated on readmission and programmes to aid return."
"– Mr President, I too am pleased with the attention with which this Parliament and the Commission have begun to examine a subject that now affects all the countries in the European Union."
"Emigrating has always been a necessity and often a hope, but seldom a choice."
"I say this as I come from a country that has had first-hand experience of the emigration problem for a great many decades."
"In recent years the subject of migration into many European countries has taken on bitter and often dramatic connotations."
"I believe it is both necessary and useful for the various Member States to share a common position on this subject, because I cannot envisage any positive scenarios unless they are regulated by all the countries in the Union."
"I also think, however, that this is one of the most sensitive issues, one of those issues that, more than any other perhaps, needs to be managed; and managing it means addressing matters of visas, employment, health, citizens’ rights and duties, and citizenship."
"I believe the right to vote, at a local and not just a European level, should be a consequence of these rights and not a precondition, as seems to have been suggested at times in some debates in recent years."
"In our eagerness for integration we must not forget that our first duty, in my opinion, is to create the means for making a living in developing countries, so that everyone can find it possible to stay in their own home country."
"Our second duty is to facilitate the return of immigrants to their countries of origin as agents for the development and growth of their own countries."
"Down in third place, I put the need for Old Europe, impoverished by low birth rates and few workers, to see migration as a benefit to our countries."
"Having said that, there is no doubt that we should have control mechanisms to enable us to combat illegal immigration and, within the Member States, to combat breaches of the host country’s rules."
"Thank you, Mrs Sartori."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"A very good afternoon to you, ladies and gentlemen."
"We welcome the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, represented by Mr Roche."
"I can assure you that Parliament will cooperate fully with you and I hope that in turn you will cooperate by replying to the questions of the honourable Members, who attach great importance to this opportunity to communicate with the Council."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0002/2004)."
"We will take a series of questions to the Council."
"Under the Irish Presidency, what measures will be taken to ensure better respect of EU laws relating to animal welfare, particularly with regard to the issue of treatment of greyhounds?"
"Greyhounds raised for racing in Ireland are frequently exported to Spain once they have come to the end of their racing career, where they are treated appallingly and with scant regard for their welfare from the Spanish authorities."
"Until 2002 a certain amount of EU money went towards the funding of greyhound breeding in Ireland."
"What measures are now being taken to ensure the welfare of these greyhounds whose breeding was financed partially by the EU?"
"How many of these greyhounds financed by the EU were exported from Ireland to Spain and under what conditions?"
". The Council regards animal welfare as a priority and has already adopted, on proposals from the Commission, a number of Community rules in this area, notably in relation to the transport of animals and the use of animals, and in particular dogs, for the purposes of research."
"However, the conditions under which dogs such as greyhounds are bred and take part in races in Member States are not regulated by Community legislation."
"Under the protocol on protection and welfare of animals annexed to the EC Treaty, the Community and the Member States are required, in formulating and implementing the Community's agriculture, transport, internal market and research policies, to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals, while respecting the legislative and administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating in particular to religious rights, cultural traditions and regional heritage."
"It is therefore up to each Member State to find a solution to this problem, and all the Council can do is to call on the competent authorities to combat the mistreatment described by the honourable Member."
"It is nice to be the first Irish person to ask the Irish presidency a question."
"I have just come from the animal welfare intergroup, where they are also hoping that animal welfare will be a big issue, especially the transport of animals."
"Commissioner Byrne said that this issue was not the EU's responsibility and is not regulated under EU legislation."
"At one stage or another, EU subsidies contributed to the breeding of many of the greyhounds in Ireland."
"That has stopped now, but it is up to each Member State, as you said."
"It is up to the Irish Government to introduce rules on breeding and proper controls, and also to ensure that the owners of the animals are responsible for them, not just for the racing period but to the end of their life."
"In Ireland, when greyhounds reach about two years of age, the vast majority of them are considered by the Irish race industry to be burned out."
"They are sold off for next to nothing to Spain, where they are raced to death."
"They are subjected to appalling cruelty."
"Religious rights do not come into this."
"It is really an issue of animal welfare, and the Irish Government should introduce something to control the breeding of greyhounds and to ensure that the people who breed them are responsible for them up to the end of their lives."
"Some sort of identification mechanism, such as a tagging system, would also make it much easier to identify them."
"I have just spoken to someone who has just come back from Spain."
"They visited an illegal race track where they saw nine Irish dogs racing."
"So we must take responsibility for these animals, regardless of whether they are in our country or have been exported."
". I thank the honourable Member."
"In some respects I think the points that she made in the latter part of her supplementary question are matters that should be put to the domestic administrations both in Ireland and perhaps in Spain."
"I fully understand her concerns and, as she knows, we have actually discussed it."
"I have outlined the Council's position on the issue, which was also the subject of a question to the Commission."
"Mr President, in my country, too, there is a group of people that is very concerned about these practices, and they want to put an end to them."
"They take it to the extent that they adopt these dogs and pay EUR 150 to do so."
"In Spain, there is a refuge as an intermediate point."
"The Council must ultimately go knocking on the door of the Member State that is accused of this, however, because we are indeed talking about mistreatment; it is not just a case of the transportation of these dogs."
"I think that the Council must take a position on this and make clear that animal rights apply throughout the EU."
"These dogs, which later become pets in my country, deserve a fair chance, respect and good treatment."
". It seems to me that we would all share the concern that any animal, irrespective of the country it is in, be treated properly and appropriately."
"It again illustrates that this is a matter for domestic legislation and rules in the individual Member States, rather than a matter for the Council."
"However, I take note of the initiative that is mentioned, which is a very worthwhile and welcome one."
". The Council is not aware of the findings to which the honourable Member of Parliament is referring."
"However, I could add that the Council restates that it is very much concerned about nuclear safety and gives all its support for attaining a high level of nuclear safety throughout the European Union."
"As the honourable Member will know, Sellafield, like all reactors, is supposed to operate as long as it fulfils the requirements of a high level of nuclear safety."
"The existing Community legislation related to the safety of nuclear installations is mainly based on Chapter 3 of Title II of the Euratom Treaty."
"Council Directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation provides the basic radiation protection obligations which must be complied with."
"While I appreciate the constraints on the Council presidency, I really have to say that people in Britain and Ireland and, indeed, throughout the European Union will find that response to their concerns completely inadequate."
"I want to say once again that the UK Public Health Minister, Melanie Johnson, has revealed that a study by the UK Department of Health discovered that the closer children lived to Sellafield the higher the level of plutonium found in their teeth."
"This is one of the most dangerous substances known to human life – and not only human life."
"Ms Johnson has said that analysis indicated that concentrations of plutonium decreased with increasing distance from the West Cumbrian coast and its Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, suggesting that this plant is the source of plutonium contamination in the wider population."
"This comes from the UK Public Health Minister."
"I would like the Irish presidency to convene a special meeting of EC experts, along with national and other experts, to assess the implications of this."
"That is the least that citizens will expect."
"I could go into the scientific data at length – reputable scientists are involved – but I shall refrain from doing so."
"I insist that we need a proper response from the Minister out of concern for the people involved."
"From our private conversations over the years the honourable Member will be aware that I share many of her concerns in this particular regard."
"I am answering here in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council."
"I will certainly take note of the suggestion that she made."
"It is a disturbing reality that we face."
"I accept that. I will certainly take note of her last proposition."
"Is the Minister aware that even the authors of this report acknowledge that levels are so low as to be insignificant to health; that levels are a thousand times less than other radioactive substances naturally present in teeth; that most of the highest results were recorded over 250 miles from Sellafield; that this material is more likely to be fallout from weapons testing, which has been present throughout the Northern Hemisphere for some years; that respected scientific and academic opinion in Northern Ireland – for which I was the minister responsible for a couple of years – as well as in his own country, contradicts many of the assertions of the Irish anti-Sellafield lobby; and that when all is said and done, this is little more than political scaremongering designed to wreck thousands of the jobs of my constituents in north-west England and to damage the livelihoods of those many communities dependent upon this vital and valuable recycling operation?"
". I am not sure that labelling a genuine concern as scaremongering is helpful."
"As I said at the outset, the Council is not aware of the findings that the honourable Member has drawn to Parliament's attention."
"Therefore, I am in no better position to respond to the supplementary question than to the original one, except to make the point that labelling genuine concerns as scaremongering is not helpful."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he would agree that the original question tabled is actually factually incorrect when it talks about endangering the health of people in Britain and Ireland."
"In the report Melanie Johnson quoted from – and as Mr Atkins has just commented – the authors actually state that there is no health risk whatsoever: there is no correlation whatsoever here with the original question."
"In fact, some of the highest readings taken were 260 miles away from Sellafield and some of the lowest were 50 miles away from Sellafield."
"It seems ironic that these comments are being made when the UK department's own report stated that the levels were a thousand times smaller than those of other radioactive substances present as a result of natural sources."
"Would the President-in-Office not agree that the question was factually incorrect and put purely for scaremongering reasons, as Sir Robert Atkins mentioned?"
"I really have nothing to add, and can only repeat what I have already said, which is that the Council is not familiar with the details and that I cannot make an adjudication one way or the other."
"I certainly would not wish to make an adjudication as to the of a question raised by a Member of this House."
"This is not a time for debate, ladies and gentlemen."
"The questioner has put a supplementary question and there are two further supplementary questions."
"Opinions differ, naturally."
"All of you would like to speak, but the Rules of Procedure do not allow for this."
"Mrs Ahern, for a personal statement, you have 15 seconds to reply."
"My position has been traduced."
"I am asking for experts to assess the implications."
"I am not saying that I am the expert."
"Can we please have a civil debate on Sellafield for once in this Parliament?"
"Let us protect our people."
"That is the bottom line I am asking for."
"Mr Fitzsimons, there cannot be more than two supplementary questions."
"I have allowed them in the chronological order in which they were requested."
"You may put other questions during the next sitting if you see fit."
"You know that you have that right."
"But today only two Members may speak."
"I must comply with the Rules of Procedure, and I would ask you to respect it as well."
"Article 7(1) of the EU Treaty states that ‘the Council … may determine the existence of the serious and persistent breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1)’ and make appropriate recommendations to that State."
"The leader of the main Spanish opposition party (PSOE) has publicly denounced as ‘inopportune, wrong-headed, imprudent, carried out clandestinely and in breach of basic legislative principles’ the Spanish Government’s ad hoc reform of the penal code by means of an amendment in the Senate to the Law on Arbitration, to punish the possible holding of a consultation of the public by the Basque Government on the reform of the Basque Country’s autonomous statute."
"The Coordinator of Izquierda Unida has stated that this reform ‘reintroduces political crime into Spanish democracy’, just as under the Franco dictatorship."
"Does the Council believe that imposing prison sentences for the crime of consulting the public respects and conforms to the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles shared by all the Member States?"
"Does it not believe that the best way of solving historic political conflicts like those in Palestine, Ireland or the Basque Country is to encourage dialogue and debate, and allow citizens themselves to be consulted so that they can reach a free and democratic decision, when the proposals put to them are fully respectful of human rights"
". As the honourable Member knows, the Council does not comment on media reports, nor is it the Council's practice to express its views on domestic political matters in Member States."
"Mr President, my question referred to the articles of the Treaty which oblige all of us – the Council, Parliament, the Governments and also the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission – to ensure compliance with human rights."
"You do not wish to give me an answer, but I would like to remind you of something which I imagine you will know much better than me."
"If I remember rightly, in Ireland, before you achieved independence, you had a provisional status, which led to a great conflict within your society between radicals and moderates."
"You resolved that situation by consulting the Irish citizens, that is, by means of a referendum."
"We have a situation in the Basque Country which is also difficult and worrying, and which is creating great tension and violence."
"We are asking that it be the citizens who can give their opinion and decide, but the Spanish Government is preventing this."
"It is also threatening and changing the laws in order to imprison those who advocate this referendum: a consultation of the citizens, which is the most democratic thing imaginable."
"Mr Ortuondo, I would remind you that this is a time for supplementary questions and not a time for political statements."
"Mr President, I would like to supplement Mr Ortuondo’s question, and remind him that this is not a decision by the Spanish Government, but that it is the Spanish Constitution itself which prevents an autonomous community from holding a referendum unilaterally and requires that any referendum be called by the King, on the proposal of the President of the Government, following authorisation from the Congress of Deputies."
"That is what our Constitution says."
"I believe that the question Mr Ortuondo should have asked – although you probably would not answer it either – is whether a person failing to comply with a law can be subject to penalty, which is what the Spanish authority has said or, in this case, the reform of the Spanish Penal Code."
"Ladies and gentlemen – in this case, Mr Oreja – I do not believe that this is a supplementary question and, naturally, the President-in-Office of the Council is not obliged to reply, but he has the floor if he wishes to say anything."
". I really have nothing to add to the point I made in answer to the original question."
"Neither of the exchanges suggests that I should do so."
"Mr MacCormick, the Mr President-in-Office of the Council’s reply was very clear: it does not leave room for supplementary questions."
"In any event, you have the floor, and I hope you will use it with your usual wisdom."
"I wanted to suggest to Mr Roche – and it is a great pleasure to see him here after many exchanges at the Convention – that the issue Mr Ortuondo Larrea raised, and with which we are dealing here, is a profound one. It is about the role and place of countries within Member States."
"The Irish presidency, not least because of its interest in the problems of Northern Ireland, but for other reasons as well, ought to give its mind and invite its colleagues to give their minds to the issue of the adequate and improved representation of countries of that kind."
"Mr Ortuondo, since you will most probably not make a point of order – I do not know if you wish to make a personal statement – you may speak for fifteen seconds and I would ask you not to cause any further personal statements, please."
"We must not spoil Question Time with other debates which should take place in the relevant setting, in this case in Spain."
"Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement."
"If what I have raised is laid down in the Spanish Constitution, why is the Peoples’ Party, the government of Mr Aznar, at night and taking advantage of a law ..."
"I would ask you to take this debate to the Basque Parliament and the Spanish Congress of Deputies, but it is not appropriate to continue debating this issue here."
"You know that I ignore the fact that I am also elected in a Spanish constituency and that I am Spanish and, as I usually say to you, I am going to act as if I were, for example, Finnish or Irish."
"The Commission, exercising its right of initiative, has submitted a proposal for the amendment of the Regulation concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE) (COM(2003)0402/final)."
"The proposed amendment is concerned with comitology issues which are of little or no interest to the general public and whose relationship with nature conservation is dubious, but it does, of course, provide an opportunity for discussing major substantive issues on which the Regulation has nothing to say."
"Is the Council intending to take advantage of this revision of the financial instrument concerned in order to incorporate the essential amendments stemming from the final report on the financing of the Natura 2000 network which has been drawn up by the Working Party referred to in Article 8 of the Commission's Directive on habitats, one of whose conclusions is that an annual budget of between EUR 3400 and 5700 million is required just for the running of the Natura 2000 network?"
". The Commission recently made a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1655/2000 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment – LIFE – mainly in two aspects."
"The first concerns only comitology."
"However, the second provides for the extension of the LIFE regime for a further two years to bridge the gap between the current regime and the new Financial Perspectives for 2007 onwards."
"On 22 December 2003 the Council held an exchange of views on this second aspect and on the options for financing the EU's environmental policies from 2007 onwards."
"In addition, the Council adopted conclusions on biodiversity in which it looked forward to the submission of the forthcoming Commission communication on financing Natura 2000."
"When received, this will provide a further opportunity for discussions on this very important issue."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Irish Presidency for the clarity with which it has attempted to answer my question."
"I must, however, insist on an issue that I believe to be crucial: I should like to know whether the Council will give due consideration to the conclusions of the working party appointed by the Commission itself, which suggested that the costs of maintaining this ‘Natura’ network would exceed EUR 3.4 billion per year."
"I should also like to know whether the Council thinks that our financial perspectives will match the commitments given by the European institutions?"
"This is the very specific issue that I would like the Council to clarify."
". The Member has raised the fundamental question of whether an annual budget of EUR 3.4 million or EUR 5.7 million would be appropriate."
"That is the key issue."
"Much of the effort to date as regards the Natura 2000 network of sites, habitats and bird directives has been devoted to the initial designation of sites; the purely mechanical side of it."
"It is very difficult at this early stage to estimate the likely costs of conserving those sites in future years."
"I understand that the Commission has been examining this question further in preparing its communication on financing Natura 2000."
"To summarise, the work has been on the designation of sites."
"Until that phase of the work is completed, it is difficult to see what the overall cost is likely to be, but I would nevertheless compliment and thank the Member for raising this issue."
"As the author is not present, Question No 5 lapses."
"In view of the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe, what measures does the Council anticipate can be put in place in the Common Position that would be likely to send a clear and strong message to President Mugabe?"
". In conformity with the common position concerning restrictive measures against Zimbabwe, the Council has kept the situation in Zimbabwe under review."
"On 28 November 2003 the presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued a statement on the current situation in Zimbabwe, expressing its continued concern regarding the climate of tension in Zimbabwe and calling on its government to respect the internationally-guaranteed rights of all Zimbabwean people."
"The question of Zimbabwe was raised in the EU-Africa dialogue during the ministerial troika meeting in Rome on 10 November 2003, where the European Union again reaffirmed its readiness to engage in dialogue with the government in Harare on the basis of established benchmarks."
"An identical message was passed directly to Zimbabwe and other SADC countries during the meeting of the EU-SADC senior officials in Brussels, held on 12 and 13 November 2003, and was again transmitted to South Africa during the political dialogue meeting in Pretoria on 8 December 2003."
"The common position, as adopted on 18 February 2002, expresses the Council's serious concern about the situation in Zimbabwe, in particular the recent escalation in violence and intimidation of political opponents and the harassment of the independent press."
"When reviewed in 2003, the common position noted that there has been further degradation in the situation in Zimbabwe, where serious violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly continue to occur."
"As already noted, the European Union has remained extremely concerned about the further degradation of the situation in Zimbabwe since then."
"The common position is up for review on 18 February 2004."
"In this context, preparatory work on recommendations to be submitted to the Council has begun within the relevant Council departments."
"These recommendations will be submitted to the Council for discussion at that time."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"I am reasonably familiar with, and approve of, the Irish Government's strong position on Zimbabwe."
"My question is about the rollover of the common position."
"I wonder whether the presidency anticipates any difficulties in securing the rollover of the existing sanctions against Zimbabwe."
"Am I right to understand that there are Member States – and one in particular – which have a problem with the rollover that the presidency and others in the Council would like to see?"
"Therefore, I am asking if you can tell me whether Member States are likely to be of one mind on the rollover."
"Second, would the President-in-Office consider it appropriate for the Council to now press for the extension of the list of banned individuals – a list of people who have sanctions against them and are not given visas – to include family members, people who have died or changed office and so on?"
"In my view and in Parliament's view – it is in our resolution on the subject – the list should be extended and reviewed."
"I should very much like your opinion on this."
"It is something of great importance to the European Parliament and I look forward to your response."
". My colleagues and I appreciate Mrs Kinnock's continued keen interest in this particular matter."
"Discussions are ongoing. It would be premature at this stage for us to say where those discussions will lead."
"There will, however, be a review of the list and there may be some extension to it."
"I should like to ask a very brief supplementary question to Mrs Kinnock's question."
"One aspect of her campaigning – which is increasingly affecting Member States, including the United Kingdom and possibly Ireland as well – is that with the escalation of violence an increasing number of refugees and asylum seekers are coming to the European Union."
"What is the Irish presidency's view of this, given the increase in numbers and that these people clearly have asylum claims and are in distress, but are also arriving in great numbers?"
"Does the President-in-Office have a view on this, given the new presidency, the escalation of violence and the inevitable increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers from Zimbabwe to EU Member States?"
". The direct answer to the question is yes, the presidency is obviously aware that any form of violence or action against civilian populations inevitably drives people out."
"We are also concerned about and aware of the impact that sanctions can have on populations."
"With regard to the specifics, I would refer back to the earlier answer that I gave directly to Mrs Kinnock: where do we go from here?"
"The next stage is a matter for current discussion and I do not want to anticipate that discussion by going further than I already have."
"I note that the honourable Members put a lot of trust in their cruising speed when taking their lifts, and this could lead to a standstill if we apply the Rules of Procedure."
"If anybody is listening to me from their offices, I would ask them to come down to the chamber, because at one point none of the Members due to ask questions were here."
"On 9 December 2003, the Commission and Syria reached an accord on an Association Agreement between Syria and the EU modelled on the agreements with the other Mediterranean partnerships, including a political chapter, an economic and financial chapter, and a social and cultural chapter."
"In the Council's view, what prospects does the agreement hold out for the two parties?"
"Does the Council believe that the signing of this agreement in the near future will facilitate regional integration, the creation of a positive climate in which to resolve the political problem of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the democratisation of Syria?"
"What is its view of the diametrically opposed positions of the USA which saw Congress and President Bush (only a few days ago) pass a law which provides for economic and diplomatic sanctions and restrictions on Syria, and does the Council sympathise with the reasons adduced by the USA for adopting this policy against Syria?"
". The Council confirms to the honourable Member that on 9 December 2003 the European Commission and Syria reached an understanding at technical level on all remaining issues in the negotiations on the Euromed Association Agreement."
"When it enters into force, this agreement will replace the existing 1977 Cooperation Agreement which, as part of the global Mediterranean approach, currently links the two sides."
"The items of the future agreement will now have to be politically approved by both sides, paving the way for ratification by both sides."
"The Council underlines that on the political side the draft agreement intends to provide a framework to conduct regular political dialogue on international issues and mutual interest, fostering mutual understanding and promoting the convergence of views."
"In particular it includes essential provisions on respect for the democratic principles on fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; cooperation to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in line with the conclusions of the External Relations Council in November 2003; and the exchange of information and joint efforts to prevent and fight against terrorism, including the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions."
"With regard to the second element in the honourable Member's question on the Middle East peace process in general, the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 12 December 2003."
"In paragraph 61 the European Council recalled that a comprehensive peace in the Middle East must also include Syria and, of course, Lebanon."
"Finally, there was a third element in the question."
"The Council has not commented on positions taken on this matter by the United States, nor does the Council intend to do so at this stage."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your reply."
"I feel that I cannot insist that you reply to me on the element on which you clearly stated that you did not intend to comment, even though I believe that an open dialogue which highlights the common points and the different approaches between the European Union and the United States is not negative; it is positive in making us aware of the situation and our joint action."
"Perhaps you could tell me more specifically, please, how this agreement with Syria, which we hope will be signed and will be put into practice, specifically serves the political and economic interests of the European Union in the area?"
"What is the particular role, the position, the influence of Syria in the Barcelona process?"
"Does it have anything to do with Lebanon and the objectives of the European Union through the agreement with Lebanon?"
". I thank the Member for that."
"I agree with her that there is no point in making negative comparisons between our approach and that of, for example, the United States."
"It is a very fine agreement and I am sure the Member has had the opportunity to read it."
"Let us consider its aims: to provide an appropriate framework for political dialogue; to establish the conditions for progressive liberalisation of trade in goods, services and capital; to enhance prosperity and economic and social development in Syria and to encourage cooperation within the Euro-Mediterranean framework, and, finally, to promote cooperation in economic, social, cultural and financial fields."
"The point about this agreement is that it emphasises very much the European ethos, the European view of the way forward."
"It is a very positive development, certainly a development that the Irish presidency welcomes and will work towards."
"There is no point in our making negative comparisons with anybody else – with the United States approach, for example."
"We have a dialogue with the United States on many levels, including the highest level."
"The Middle East issue, the issue of the entire region and peace in the region, is obviously an important part of that dialogue."
"The matter of Syria's place in the peace process will feature in the dialogue."
"Again, I thank the Member for a very searching and deep question which provides an opportunity to cover a significant number of important areas."
"Mr President-in-Office, could I press you a little further on this?"
"You briefly alluded to the issue of weapons of mass destruction, which, rather surprisingly, on 6 January 2004, President Assad effectively admitted to possessing."
"Could you tell me what kind of mandate you will give the Commission to incorporate clauses that are specifically salient and relevant to the issue of Syria's biological and chemical weapons stock, and whether the Syrians will be encouraged strongly within these clauses to effectively dismantle them and avoid any proliferation of such dangerous weapons?"
". The precise details in that regard will have to be considered by the Council, but there is a specific reference to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery."
"That is in accordance with the decisions taken in the External Relations Council in November 2003."
"You can rest assured that the presidency and the Council have in mind the positive elements of this particular agreement in the context of the region and in the context of weapons of mass destruction in general."
"It is interesting that you mention that you collude with or discuss with the US how you are dealing with Syria and yet your policies are in such contrast."
"Is that a sort of 'nice cop, nasty cop' approach to Syria?"
"I should like to ask, in particular, about Lebanon."
"Syria is in occupation of large parts of Lebanon, its neighbouring country."
"What attitude do you take to this position as regards any furtherance of this agreement?"
". I would take exception to the world 'collude'."
"There is a dialogue between Europe and the United States, which is quite appropriate."
"Issues relating to Lebanon and Syria are obviously going to be part of that dialogue."
"It is certainly not a question of 'good cop, bad cop'."
"Europe has its view as to how it does its business and the United States has its view as to how it does its business."
"Those views are informed by our own different backgrounds."
"The point I am making about this agreement is that it is a very positive indication of the European approach to this particular matter."
"The outgoing Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministers recommended to the Council's Working Party on Drugs that police from Member States should be posted in Albania."
"As the Council must know, Albanian gangs are increasingly involved in growing and smuggling tonnes of locally-grown cannabis into the Union but are also becoming implicated in trading 'hard' drugs such as heroin and cocaine which are produced outside Albania."
"Are Member State police in Albania yet?"
"If not, when will they arrive there?"
"Who is in command of them?"
". The Council remains concerned at the issue of organised crime and drug trafficking in Albania."
"In the conclusions of the last Council meeting on external relations on 9 December 2003, the Council expressed concern over the slow process of reform in Albania and urged the Albanian Government to intensify its efforts, particularly in its fight against organised crime."
"Helping the Albanian Government to fight drug trafficking has been an integral part of EU efforts to contribute to the fight against organised crime in Albania."
"Police forces and experts from the European Union and Member States have consistently been present in Albania, particularly since the 1997 crisis, to help the Albanian Government in various ways, including specific operations, to build capacity and fight organised crime, including drug production and drug trafficking."
"As regards drugs, major initiatives were taken under the Greek and Italian presidencies in 2003 to enhance the fight against drug trafficking in the Balkan region in general and in Albania in particular."
"In June 2003 a comprehensive action plan on drugs was agreed between the European Union and the Western Balkan States."
"A large part of this plan was devoted to the fight against drugs trafficking."
"A very fruitful follow-up meeting was held on 2 December 2003 in Brussels."
"As regards Albania in particular, the Council adopted in November 2003 a resolution on the posting of liaison officers with particular expertise in drugs in Albania."
"This resolution envisages the setting up of a coordination mechanism among the liaison officers in order to ensure a constant exchange of information on drugs-related activities and also to foster common understanding."
"On a more general level, a meeting between ministers of the EU Member States and ministers of the Western Balkan countries was held on 27 November 2003 on the sidelines of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"The common conclusions resulting from that meeting stressed the need to enhance law enforcement capacity in the Western Balkans."
"On the general issue of the Western Balkans, the Irish presidency will do anything that it can to assist governments in that region – which face significant challenges – and to involve them as much as we possibly can."
"Thank you very much for that full, helpful and informative reply."
"I should like to add my congratulations to the Irish for the leadership they are showing on this difficult question."
"I attended the conference on organised crime in Dublin before Christmas, it was excellent and the Irish showed great leadership."
"I congratulate you very much on the initiative you are showing."
"Is there a chain of command for these liaison officers from the EU who are going to be posted in Albania?"
"Who do they report to?"
"Do they each report to their own national capital?"
"Do they report to Europol in The Hague?"
"Is there somebody in charge?"
"How is it organised?"
"The great problem here with policing – as you must know even better than I – is that individual nationalities and forces are reluctant to cooperate."
"They each try to keep the information they have to themselves."
"What we need is much more coordination and cooperation, even between EU police forces."
"Can you give me any assurance that this is happening?"
"Who is in charge?"
"Who liaises with whom?"
"On the matter of liaison officers, I agree with the Member that there is no point in people being posted individually. There must be some form of coordination and certainly some form of exchange of information at a very basic level."
"I refer the Member to what I said in my previous response, which was that the resolution envisages the setting-up of a coordination mechanism among liaison officers to ensure a constant exchange of information."
"The point that the Member has put his finger on is absolutely correct: there is no point in intelligence gathering if the information is not shared."
"This is a new departure."
"We are at the point of establishing this coordination mechanism."
"I am sure that the Member's observations will be helpful in that specific regard."
"Could the President-in-Office comment on how his Presidency programme is assisted by the recently agreed multi-annual strategic programmes?"
". The Council recalls that, as foreseen by the Presidency Conclusions from the European Council in Seville of 21 and 22 June 2002, the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003 adopted the first Multiannual Strategic Programme for the three years to come."
"The programme covers the period 2004 to 2006."
"It has been prepared jointly by the six presidencies Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Austria and Finland which in turn will assume stewardship of the Council over that period."
"They are collectively vested with responsibility for ensuring that the Council delivers on its agreed priorities up to 2006 effectively and on time."
"The presidency found the recently agreed Multiannual Strategic Programme to be a very useful basis for the preparation of both the Annual Operating Programme and the Irish Presidency Programme."
"The presidency considers it increasingly important that a longer term perspective be taken, with regard to the work of the Council, beyond the six-month term of each presidency."
"In that respect the Multiannual Strategic Programme and the Annual Operational Programme are essentially tools in guiding the preparation of the Presidency Programme."
"This is a new departure and it is a very worthwhile and welcome departure."
"It gives a more structured basis for the on-going Community relationships with the rest of the world."
"I agree with what the President-in-Office has said about the value of these tools and place on the record my welcome for the Irish presidency programme in this respect."
"However, when he says that it is a useful basis, it would be instructive for all of us to learn what that means in practice."
"Otherwise, is this yet another piece of bureaucracy with no real purpose or real difference?"
"What is it in the Irish presidency programme that is different because of the multiannual approach with the six presidencies together?"
"Has there been an area where special emphasis has been placed that perhaps would not have been otherwise?"
"I wonder, in relation to Ireland, for example – being a neutral country and not part of Nato – whether the advancement of the security strategy, the planned intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Defence Capabilities Agency are areas on which you will be putting extra emphasis."
"I would be genuinely interested to hear your views on those points."
". The honourable Member will appreciate that this really is the first time we have been into this particular process and it will take a little time for this process to bed down."
"Nonetheless, a multiannual approach is clearly logical and is a better approach to that which preceded it."
"It is very helpful to incoming presidencies to have a role to play so that they can interlink all the issues."
"I cannot be more specific other than to say that the Multiannual Strategic Programme is helpful."
"It will certainly give us a much stronger framework and a better time allowance."
"It will mean that there can be more reasonable anticipation that programmes will be fully worked through."
"It is in all those regards and I think that is what the Member has in mind clearly a much better approach than that which preceded it."
"What steps does the Council propose to take to find a common political position on the Temporary/Agency Workers Directive, given the importance of this legislation for progress on the Lisbon Agenda?"
". The Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the answers already given to a question by Claude Moraes in July 2003 and a question raised by you last November on the same issue, in which the Council confirmed its commitment to reaching a common political position on this complex and politically sensitive dossier."
"During the first semester in 2003 the presidency put together a compromise package covering the key outstanding issues which were discussed by the Council in a public session which was held on 3 June 2003."
"However, the proposed solution is not acceptable to all delegations."
"During the second semester, various high-level discussions were held but, in the absence of new elements allowing the situation to be unblocked, the matter was not discussed at the Council meeting of 1 December 2003 as had been initially envisaged and hoped."
"As the Member knows – because the Member has raised this matter in different fora – the Irish presidency attaches great importance to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, and will of course reflect on how this dossier can be finalised in that context."
"The Council has consistently given a confirmed commitment to reaching the Lisbon goals of increasing employment and providing better jobs, and intends to work for a fair and practical solution which takes into account all legitimate concerns – and there are many of them."
"To this end, the presidency intends to reflect on the different possible tracks to be followed in this dossier and will remain alert to any new developments which could help in resolving the outstanding areas of difficulty."
"I should like to add that, thanks to the good work of Mr De Rossa, the presidency had a very good exchange with members of his Group last week in Dublin."
"This issue was raised at that stage."
"There was a very full and helpful exchange on the issue so, again, I compliment the Member."
"I am fully aware of his concerns on the issue and the presidency is also fully aware of his concerns."
"As the Member knows, we will work on this dossier within the context of the general work we are doing on the Lisbon agenda issues."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his comprehensive and welcome reply."
"He has indicated a willingness to progress this dossier, which an important one in the context of the Lisbon Agenda."
"I know that the presidency sees the Lisbon Agenda as a comprehensive vehicle for achieving both social and economic progress, and this directive, which would instil some order into the issue of temporary agency workers, would improve the quality of work and also relieve many anxieties of both permanent workers and temporary agency workers."
"We know that this particular form of employment is, in certain circumstances, being abused."
"I would appreciate it, therefore, if the President-in-Office of the Council would actively pursue this matter."
"I have no wish to make party political points here, but given that the Irish Government has serious concerns about this issue, you are in an ideal position to find solutions to it."
". I thank Mr De Rossa and I very much recognise the importance of securing an agreement on proposals to improve the rights of workers."
"I also understand precisely where Mr De Rossa is coming from in this particular regard."
"The point he is making is that one tries to raise everybody's position upward, rather than trying to create a downward movement."
"I accept the sincerity of his cause and I think he also understands the views of the presidency in that regard."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for your full reply."
"Are you aware that whilst the Council is clearly divided on this issue, this House is also divided?"
"There are different views, as my good friend Mr De Rossa is also aware."
"The fact that here you have a UK Conservative MEP speaking in support of the UK Labour Government and against the opinions of UK Labour MEPs shows that this issue is sensitive and rather complicated."
"I welcome your comment that you are going to reflect, but I urge you to reflect also on the phrases that you have put into this excellent document – the programme of your presidency – which I particularly welcome."
"On page 16 you mention the key challenges you are committed to pursuing: encouraging greater adaptability and flexibility on the part of workers and companies and removing disincentives to employment."
"My own view is that the directive, as drafted, would have done exactly the opposite and cut across the possibility of achieving the Lisbon agenda."
"Can I have your reassurance that the fulfilment of the Lisbon agenda will indeed colour your entire presidency, as I am confident it will?"
"Good luck, Sir!"
". I thank the Member for that."
"I do not believe that adaptability and flexibility naturally enhancing or supporting the rights of workers need ever necessarily be in contradiction to each other."
"In Ireland we have had some experience in recent years of the tremendous progress that can be made economically by having an inclusive approach to it."
"I accept the point that the Member made."
"It is a complex issue."
"There are different views on this, both within this House and within Europe."
"However, in general, it would be a fallacy for us to think that we have to build in flexibility, adaptability or progress at a cost to workers."
"That should not be the basis on which we make our progress."
"I am sure that is not what the Member has in mind."
"I should like to join my colleagues in welcoming the President-in-Office, Mr Roche, to the House and wishing him luck for the next six months."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews, Mr De Rossa and myself work on the same committee, so we know some of the difficulties here."
"But is the presidency aware of the different definitions of agency workers in different Member States, and how this creates a difficulty as regards drawing up harmonised regulations or directives, the purpose of which is to protect workers and actually to improve their position within employment?"
"Secondly, with regard to Mr Bushill-Matthews' comments on the Lisbon agenda, individual workers should have the freedom of choice, because in some situations temporary agency workers actually earn more money and have more flexibility than they would if they were in contract-based employment."
". I accept the final point the Member made, which illustrates something of the complexity of this issue."
"There are specific cases that come to mind."
"Young medical graduates, for example, may well choose to work on an agency basis because it is more flexible and suits them better."
"We are aware of that."
"The second point that Mr Crowley touched on was the general question of the rights of contract workers."
"I recognise the importance of securing agreement on proposals that improve the rights of workers, including temporary agency workers, but which at the same time do not force anybody to operate in a way they would not wish to."
"As I have said, the presidency sees this as an important issue, not least within the context of the Lisbon strategy."
"The Member will be aware that we are committed to achieving the Lisbon goals of increasing employment and providing better jobs, and that includes more choices for workers."
"The point raised in the original question was that this should not be achieved on the backs of the workers; that is the core issue of concern to Mr De Rossa."
"The point has been made that this is a complex matter."
"There are different views on the issue and as the last supplementary question illustrates, there may be circumstances in which workers wish to benefit from this more flexible approach."
"Clearly their right to choose should not be interfered with in a way that would diminish that right."
"Under Article 4(1)(d) of Council Directive 2003/86/EC(1) on the right to family reunification a Member State may, where a child is aged over 12 years, before authorising entry and residence under the directive, verify whether he or she meets the necessary conditions."
"Since the children in question come from less developed areas and are unable to cope with the demands of the verification procedure, does the Council not consider that in practice it undermines the right to reunification?"
". My reply will be very brief."
"The honourable Member's attention is drawn to the fact that under the Treaty, it is not for the Council to comment on the interpretation of Community legislative acts."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office does not need to be that brief."
"This is the last question and we have half an hour at our disposal."
"I am not asking him to comment on something foreign, I am asking him to talk to us about a directive which the Council approved, on which the President of the European Parliament has taken steps in connection with referral to the Court of Justice, on which non-governmental organisations have taken steps and which makes provision for children of 12 years of age and upwards – just think if it were our daughter, or your daughter, or the daughter of an honourable Member or the daughter of someone who works here – to pass examinations in order to be united with their family."
"We cannot deal with this matter with this sort of technocracy and without a sensitive reply by the President-in-Office of the Council and I call for a material response."
". I do not like off-the-cuff or technocratic answers either and I wish I could give you a more substantial answer, but the point is that the only institution which, with regard to the Treaty, has the power actually to interpret Community legislation is ultimately the Court of Justice, but the Member is aware of this and does not need me to lecture him in this regard."
"However, it should be recalled that the Court of Justice has been called upon to give a ruling on the directive on the right to family reunification, adopted in September 2003, insofar as a direct action has been brought before it for its annulment."
"The point I am making – and the core issue in the reply – is not intended to be in any way discourteous to the Member or to diminish his question; rather, I am simply making the point that on the issue of interpretation there is no appropriate role for the Council."
"I am sorry I cannot expand on this."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council(2)."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Pirker that this is a good report, even if, personally, I would have liked to go further."
"The aim of managing migratory flows is in fact rooted in the illusion of strict regulation, something which has proved impossible in the last several years."
"Few countries have admitted to the limitations, let alone the failure, of the programmes they intended putting in place."
"Those programmes are no match for the problems posed by the complexity and diversity of the flows, which encompass traditional movements of labour, people fleeing poverty and asylum seekers."
"National traditions, cultural peculiarities, massive or residual xenophobia and a greater or lesser openness to the claims of minorities explain the differences between the Member States’ immigration policies."
"Refugee status is particularly attractive when immigration or staying in a country legally has become virtually impossible, and it is in fact the only door that stands ajar for entry to many of our countries."
"The many attempts to take advantage of it by persons not strictly covered by the Geneva Convention but who fall into the much wider category of economic migrants, attempts which are sometimes exploited by organised crime, have cast suspicion on all applicants and provided a pretext for considerable restrictions on the right to asylum, which is appalling."
"Having on our territory people with no rights, with absolutely no security, in fear of being reported to the authorities, reduced to feeding the profitable illegal labour market or resorting to petty crime, but who nevertheless prefer that situation to the risk of being returned to their countries of origin, in fact raises inevitable social, moral and legal questions."
"Undoubtedly, this problem needs to be tackled as one affecting all Europeans."
"It is also clear that we cannot arrive at a rational policy by being guided by narrow national interests alone."
"With rising populism symptomatic of xenophobia, many fear seeing the common treatment of the immigration issue take on a dangerously repressive hue, although we know full well that such a policy is no answer to the problems but that, quite the contrary, it risks enflaming them."
"I want to conclude by saying that stepping up the fight against terrorism must not be allowed to affect the integrity of our immigration and asylum policies and in particular the substantial development of our national integration policies. Immigration is a reality and we will always have to deal with flows of migrants into Europe seeking work or fleeing persecution."
"Mr President, Mr Pirker’s report has a long title, suggesting a multiplicity of subjects."
"To an extent, the mix of subjects renders the report impractical and difficult to place in relation to the real world, but that is in no way Mr Pirker’s fault."
"In general, I am able to support the report’s overall objective of strengthening cooperation and coordination within the EU in these essential and cross-border areas of policy."
"The report nonetheless contains a proposal that I find too far-reaching: that of establishing a federal European corps of border guards which – in contrast to, for example, Europol – would have extensive operational authority to use its powers."
"I am opposed to the creation of a federal corps of border guards."
"With regard to the principle of subsidiarity, I do not think that the Commission is able to document either the effect of, or the operational need for, a federal corps of border guards."
"Secondly, I think it is too early to establish such a corps."
"We still do not know what would be the effects of the many sensible proposals, such as those for increased cooperation and coordination between the Member States’ customs and border authorities."
"In particular, no account has been taken of the encouraging fact that we are now working towards a better distribution of the financial burden."
"Thirdly, there is simply no legal basis in the existing Treaties for a federal corps of border guards and, even if the Convention’s proposals for new Treaty wordings were adopted, it is doubtful if there would be a legal basis for such a corps."
"I recognise that, in its present form, the proposal to introduce an EU corps of border guards simply proposes a model according to which the Member States might voluntarily make use of this force. At the same time, it is clear, however, that, if the introduction of a corps of border guards were to have any meaning at all, the Commission would, in the long term, plan to delegate a number of EU tasks to that body."
"In other words, the common corps of border guards would, to an increasing degree, come under general EU legislation, and the voluntary element would thus quickly become illusory. With regard to the proposals concerning the biometric data, I do not wish to comment in more detail upon these at the present time."
"To sum up, I recommend, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in the report."
"At the same time, it is, however, crucial for me to emphasise that what I want is a common policy in this area and not a common police force."
"– Mr President, the report by Mr Pirker – whom I congratulate – clearly sets out the need finally to create a common policy at European level against illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"While the Member States must specifically retain their competences regarding the security of their external borders and the establishment of domestic immigration quotas, it is equally necessary and urgent to set up effective transnational cooperation to create a common on visas, border control and repatriation, as the rapporteur has underlined."
"An effective coordination policy, the harmonisation of certain procedures and the prompt exchange of information would make it possible to combat illegal immigration more effectively, as well as many other criminal activities that are linked to it: drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings, to give just a couple of examples."
"It is worth recalling that an intransigent policy of combating illegal immigration would not only give Europe’s citizens greater confidence and security but would also allow all legal immigrants to enjoy their rights and opportunities to the full."
"In any case, it should be underlined that the European Union should strengthen its external relations with all those non-Community countries that want to collaborate effectively in combating illegal immigration and should also promote the so-called special quota policy for such countries."
"I do not believe it is mere rhetoric, then, to recall that we must direct our greatest efforts to a strong cooperation and development policy, which will in general help most to contain immigration and stop the outflow of people and hence of manpower, as well as the brain drain, from the countries of origin, not only to avoid draining the developing countries of human resources but also to avoid condemning them to certain, irreversible economic and social decline."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Kratsa personally for her initiative in drafting this particular report, because it is a fact that the development of the services sector and combating the problem of unemployment, in other words job creation, are directly related."
"As Mrs Kratsa said, there is a close connection between the development of an economy and the percentage of employment in the services sector. If we bear in mind that we need to create 22 million jobs by 2010, in order to meet the Lisbon target, and that, on the basis of the information which we have, 67% of jobs are being created in services, we can understand how important the question of developing services is to attaining the objective of full employment."
"The proposals contained in the report are in keeping to a large extent with the objectives of the European strategy on employment, as incorporated in the guidelines on employment in 2003, which were approved last July and which we have debated repeatedly both in the Committee on Employment and in Plenary."
"I should like to refer to certain issues in the guidelines which basically coincide with the proposals in the report. I would remind you that guideline 2 refers very specifically to entrepreneurship, to the link between creating jobs and entrepreneurship, and the Member States are called on to encourage innovation in entrepreneurship, the ability to invest and a favourable business environment for all businesses."
"We cannot develop services if we do not invest in human resources. Here we have Commission proposals on research, training, lifelong learning and the specific objectives set in the Member States in relation to their education systems, be they in connection with the first stages of children leaving school or support for families and social infrastructures."
"The third important Commission initiative is that yesterday it approved a proposal for a directive on services within the framework of the internal market."
"This will give this sector additional dynamism, with beneficial results for employment."
"So, taking account of these three sectors: first, the specific guidelines in the strategy on employment which essentially and to a large extent relate to the need to develop services; secondly, the need for investment in human resources and, thirdly, the directive on services within the framework of the internal market, I think that, on the part of the European Union, there is an important framework which could help the Member States to implement their individual national policies."
"I should like to emphasise that it is also clear in the report by Mrs Kratsa that she is calling not for the creation of additional means, but for greater specialisation in the existing strategy on employment, to take account of the special characteristics of the services sector. I absolutely agree with her and, of course, this debate will also continue in the European Parliament for some time to come."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her forward-looking report on developing the service sector in such a way as to create new and, I would emphasise, important future jobs. I wish at the same time to express my pleasure and satisfaction at the fact that Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, as rapporteur, and the committee as a whole have so kindly dealt with the many amendments I put forward."
"Firstly, undeclared, or ‘black’, work must be converted into regular work within the service sector in order to improve the general business climate and taxpayer morale and to create competition under equal conditions."
"The EU must step up cooperation in combating ‘black’ work."
"Secondly, the European Parliament should call upon the Member States to develop and stimulate the support and household-related service sector in order to make it easier to combine working life and family life, especially in the light of the European Union’s having identified the demographic challenge as one of its most important issues for the future."
"Thirdly, the European Parliament should make the Member States aware that demographic developments in the majority of Member States are such that work in the area of care for the elderly should be accorded higher status, especially among young people. I want to emphasise that."
"Fourthly, the European Parliament should emphasise to the Member States the urgent importance of increasing opportunities for disabled people and immigrants to have access to the labour market in the service sector."
"Such improvements are necessary in the light of future needs in, for example, the health and health care sectors, as well as in order to increase these groups’ participation and integration in the labour market and in the social community."
"I would also emphasise the need for the report to signal the value of entrepreneurship and the spirit of new enterprise in the service sector, as well as the evolution of a dynamic and creatively developed cooperative service and business sector."
"Mr President, I must begin by gently drawing attention to what we said in 2001 in the report for which I was responsible. We know that this is a major problem."
"It is present in all the Member States and probably to approximately the same degree, as indicated by the studies conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions(the Dublin Foundation), which calculated a figure of eight per cent."
"This may be compared with the figure of four per cent for violence in the workplace and two per cent for sexual harassment. Overall, this type of harassment – outright violence, psychological violence and sexual harassment – is a major problem."
"Because there was a clear link between this problem and stress and tension in the workplace. We know how the labour market is changing at present."
"We now see a change when it comes to the organisation of working life. We have insecurity and less certainty in the workplace, which also means that this problem is probably becoming more serious."
"On the earlier occasion, we demanded, firstly, an analysis in the form of a Green Paper providing us with a more detailed picture of the situation and, secondly, possible legislation too, but those were not the only instruments."
"So imagine, then, our frustration when we now perceive that nothing has happened."
"Commissioner, I share your view when you say that it is now important to make contact with both sides of industry. It is also true that it is important to use a wide range of instruments, because the legal instrument is not enough."
"We probably have to work on issues relating to influence and the organisation of work and to review how matters operate out in the workplace, but we also need legal instruments. Now that measures are to be proposed and implemented to combat violence in the workplace, this is an excellent opportunity also to take account of psychological violence, including harassment, in the workplace."
"In Sweden, we already had legislation, and Belgium has introduced legislation, but otherwise nothing very much has happened. Because this is a Community area, involving health and safety in the workplace, we and the Commission have a responsibility in this area."

"Mr President, on a point of order, yesterday some colleagues will recall that during the vote on the Herzog report I suggested that the President look at Rule 130a."
"We had a mass of amendments to vote on."
"Before that, we had voted on amendments to a report drawn up on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"To make voting easier, however, these amendments had been arranged in blocks."
"Rule 130a states quite clearly that where there is a mass of amendments, the committee involved should try to sort them out before they are put to the vote in plenary."
"I would like the Bureau to have a proper look at Rule 130a so that Parliament's services can be instructed to ensure that the committees observe that Rule."
"– I have already been requested to consider the matter raised by you and I think that, at the appropriate time and place, I will attempt to do as you suggest."
"Mr President, just to build on my colleague Mr Provan's point of order, I should like to draw the attention of all colleagues here to the fact that 215 amendments have been tabled on the Zappalà report, which we shall be debating shortly."
"To pick up on Mr Provan's point, under Rule 130a it is the responsibility of all of us here, between now and the vote, to simplify the voting procedure."
"I am sure the Mr Zappalà would agree with that."
"We should take note of that lesson and ensure that when this is voted in plenary in February we have a much-simplified voting list."
"– Thank you for that contribution, Mr Harbour."
"–The next item is the report (A5-0470/2003) by Mr Zappalà, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the recognition of professional qualifications (COM(2002) 119 – C5-0113/2002 – 2002/0061(COD))."
". Mr President, this is a much debated and very important issue."
"I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, for his report, which usefully completes the Commission text in some places and supports the substantial consolidation proposed."
"We all know that it is a very wide-ranging proposal that covers a large variety of issues of great interest to the professions and also more generally."
"I should like to thank Parliament for the efforts it has made towards finding workable compromises."
"I should like to pay tribute to the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and other committees for their active contributions."
"In particular, I should like to welcome the maintenance, with some additional flexibility, of the existing levels of qualification, which have already played a central role in the operation of professional recognition at EU level."
"Let me point out that we face the need to improve conditions of free movement for professionals in an enlarged Union through simpler and clearer rules, simpler and more effective management systems and clearer and simpler conditions for cross-frontier service provision."
"The Commission is ready to take into account the special considerations which apply to the health-sector professions in order to find appropriate solutions within the wider context of simplification."
"I shall now be pleased to listen to the debate on this crucial proposal."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the Parliament’s rapporteur I must thank the Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein for initiating this important piece of legislation."
"There are tens of millions of professional persons in the Union."
"By virtue of the activities they perform they regulate and govern the life of every citizen."
"The professions are the most important productive social group in existence."
"Their activities embrace every aspect of cultural and educational experience, individual creativity, assertiveness, advocacy and responsibility."
"It is the social group most concerned with care and protection, most in need of clear-cut rules to be respected."
"Each State independently and legitimately organises, in keeping with its own social and historical traditions, educational courses and lays down its own rules for entering the various professions."
"The Union must guarantee freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, equal rights of access to employment, competition, safety, health and freedom, whilst fully completing the internal market by providing reliable guarantees for professionals and consumers on an equal footing."
"In real life there are huge differences within national legal systems and enormous discrepancies between different States."
"The complexity of the subject-matter coupled with the different nature of various professional activities, self-serving interests and errors of political judgement give rise to out-and-out confusion and in-fighting within the political and professional classes."
"The professions must learn to pursue an all-embracing unity of purpose in their own interests and in the interests of the consumers who rely upon them from day to day."
"Politicians must abandon their superficial and partial view of the issue and tackle the sector as a whole."
"The attitude of some politicians and of certain representatives, together with ignorance coupled with the arrogance of those who deliberately confuse themselves and others, harm the professions and the community."
"I call on the Commission, which I thank again for having drafted the proposal, to consider Parliament’s amendments not as an obstructive act, but rather as the legislature making use of its legitimate and rightful power as a democratic representative body and, for this reason, I call for the utmost cooperation in the interests of the Union."
"Professionals are atypical providers of services precisely because they are more productive in intellectual terms than in terms of specific resources."
"The services they provide are not the same and often cannot be compared with each other, nor can the principle of competition easily be applied to the sector because, over and above price, a professional service is primarily the result of intellectual creativity which stems from both the cultural background and a lively intellect."
"Not all professions are equal; the professions more at the cutting edge, such as those concerned with health, freedom and safety, are not on a par with those concerned with commercial, craft, industrial or economic activities."
"Access to such professions is regulated by States in accordance with local tradition and culture and is also subject to responsibilities and assurances offering minimum guarantees for consumers."
"Harmonisation does not mean bland similarity."
"The British system should not be exported but harmonised with other systems for the purpose of achieving a level playing field within the Union."
"No one person represents everybody, only the legislature has general responsibility."
"We have the duty to legislate not in the interests of some arrogant lobbyist but in the general interest: hearing the arguments put by all sides and reaching an individual decision is the primary duty of those mandated to work on behalf of the Community."
"The proposal is based on the following assumptions: recognition of five levels of qualification, initial continuous training, the free movement of professional services and not of pieces of paper; consultation with the professions; the thresholds proposed by recognised bodies; compliance with authorised national structures, whether bodies, colleges or associations; pro-forma registration; equality of rights and duties; legislative certainty; the elimination of bureaucratic red tape; the mutual recognition of professions exercised in individual States and, where necessary, at levels higher than corresponding qualifications; compliance with insurance, social security and trade union rules."
"Any objections are self-seeking rhetoric designed to stymie the progress of the internal market and this important sector."
"Any objections run the risk of being seen as a sop to self-interested lobby groups which do not act in the collective interest."
"The directive is important irrespective of its individual contents."
"I am not putting up barriers; the overall picture is more important than the detail."
"I hope that everyone views this from a European perspective and not from a lobbyist’s position."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive is intended to replace 15 existing directives on the recognition of professional qualifications."
"The Commission has chosen a horizontal approach that carries the danger that all professional qualifications will be lumped together."
"That should not happen."
"Qualification dumping should be prevented on consumer protection grounds alone."
"We must ensure that training is of a high quality."
"The Committee is also concerned that cross-border service provision is to be facilitated by lowering the requirements for the standard of qualification of the service provider."
"Under the Commission’s proposal, any supplier who is lawfully established in a Member State will be allowed to provide services in another Member State on a temporary basis for 16 weeks in a year, without needing any authorisation or being subject to any controls."
"We were unable to agree to that."
"Service providers have to fulfil their duty both to the recipient of the service and to the authorities of the host Member State."
"That is the only way that control and protection mechanisms can have any effect."
"Especially sensitive activities must be subject to controls."
"The citizen cannot assess the quality of doctors or tax consultants for themselves, for example."
"He relies on the existence of the familiar tried and tested systems of training, qualification and authorisation."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs would also like to be sure that persons who, because of national regulations, are highly qualified professionals are not disadvantaged by comparison with those who have a low level of qualification but the same job title."
"It is, however, essential that the wording of the legislation does not call freedom of movement into question."
"We therefore welcome the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur Mr Zappalà, whom I congratulate on his balanced report, have found a compromise between a horizontal and a sectoral approach, ensuring that professional organisations were able to contribute their expertise in the transposition of the directive."
". Mr President, on Tuesday this week in the United Kingdom a Dr Harold Shipman committed suicide."
"He was not just a statistic; he was a health professional who was serving 15 life sentences for the murder of 215 of his patients."
"Therefore, Commissioner, when we are looking at professional qualifications and seeking ways of facilitating professional mobility, as we should, we are not just talking about job opportunity or filling vacancies, or even individual professional freedom."
"We should be talking about the protection of vulnerable individuals: simple procedures, yes; riskier procedures, no."
"In Britain, if you go to your doctor's surgery, you expect the nice new doctor from Italy or Lithuania or wherever to be qualified, and you assume that the proper checks have been made as to his or her integrity and experience and to ensure that the name does not figure on any blacklist for professional or other malpractice."
"The same applies to your dentist, your nurse, your pharmacist and to other professions, too, such as the architect who has built your house."
"Hence, we were horrified to realise that the original proposal would have allowed any professional to go to any other EU country and practise there for 16 weeks without any authorisation, checks or vetting."
"Dr Shipman could have come to a surgery near you."
"Having talked to British and European professional organisations, I therefore raised this in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which asked me to produce an opinion."
"This was adopted unanimously."
"It struck out the 16-week provision, it added Article 152 as a legal basis for the directive, and it called for the setting up of a European database of professionals who have been struck off in one Member State, so that they cannot practise in another."
"These and most of our other amendments, I am happy to say, have been accepted by Mr Zappalà and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"We are grateful to them."
"More importantly, patients and our constituents in every Member State will be grateful if these safeguards are maintained."
".Mr President, the Commission has repeatedly confirmed the need to establish a knowledge-based Europe geared towards the market of European citizens, a more competitive and dynamic knowledge-based Europe which also promotes quality training and education, particularly by guaranteeing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and diplomas as a concrete and tangible proof of European citizenship."
"That requires that any obstacle to the free movement of citizens, to the mobility of workers and to the professions in the single European market be eliminated."
"To date, however, this is subject to major difficulties which, without going into too much detail, I want to list: the lack of any real spirit of cooperation, help and understanding; the complexity of existing national legislation; the reluctance of national authorities; the preference given to educational and training criteria instead of to examinations intended to ensure that education is really equivalent for the purpose of recognising diplomas; the lack of academic recognition of diplomas and other courses of study."
"Mr Zappalà’s well-balanced report, which I support, has dealt in a constructive and pragmatic way with the question of a European Union that is increasingly consensual and united wherein European citizens will play a primary role, particularly citizens with professional qualifications."
"There are, however, I repeat, certain outstanding matters and problems that must be resolved and, as the Committee for Petitions and I myself believe, over and above any statement of principle, effective action is required – as happened, for example, in the case of consultation – with a view to establishing effective measures to control and promote resources for the purpose of embracing the different Community provisions governing the legal systems of the Member States and maximising the potential of the Community system itself for the recognition of professional qualifications and academic diplomas, with a view to making that system more transparent, responsive and accessible to the persons concerned."
"In addition to this, greater attention must be paid to new information technologies in recognition of the need for permanent life-long learning."
"The Committee on Petitions has received a large number of petitions on the matter and this demonstrates the urgency with which this situation must be tackled in order to establish Europe effectively as an open place for culture, the professions and European citizens."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and my British colleagues, I very much welcome Mr Zappalà's tremendous work on a very complex text."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner has welcomed many of the amendments that were made."
"It is important to emphasise the crucial role that this particular piece of improved legislation will play in our overall strategy for the internal market."
"We witnessed the welcome launch this week, by the Commissioner himself, of proposal on the internal market for services."
"Clearly the cross-border delivery of professional services by people whose qualifications are mutually and unimpeachably recognised, in a manner that addresses the issues of quality and consumer protection raised by a number of my colleagues, is an absolutely indispensable part of that move forward to complete the internal market."
"We must be absolutely sure to see this revised proposal in that context."
"In that connection, more work needs to be done on Mr Zappalà's report."
"I and a number of my colleagues on this side of the House feel that keeping the five distinct levels of professional qualification and the definition of them is important."
"We have tabled a series of amendments clarifying the package of qualifications that will enable professionals to move into each of the levels that are to be mutually recognised."
"I hope that colleagues across the House will recognise those particular qualifications."
"The other important aspect of this proposal is that we need to encourage more professionals to set out their stall for mutual recognition and to accept a common platform proposal to work together to develop that."
"That is something that many professionals need to do."
"At this point I declare an interest as a professional engineer."
"We want to develop a common platform for Europe's engineers, but the one point on which I differ with the rapporteur is that his report seeks to impose a separate regime for engineers, devised from one particular point of view."
"That is premature. Europe's engineers want to work on a mutual recognition platform, but they do not want one imposed by this Parliament working in one particular direction."
"My colleagues and I will therefore be putting together a package of amendments that allows engineers to develop their own platform."
"I hope that is something which will command the support of a large majority of this House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the House has before it a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, which we welcome."
"It is in fact something we urgently need in order to create clarity and legal certainty throughout the European Union."
"The horizontal approach is a good one."
"It will produce uniform legislation instead of a diversity of solutions."
"The work on this text has however cost a lot of time, commitment and sweat."
"That was because of the variety of professional fields involved and also, to be perfectly honest, the flood of requests made to us by the persons concerned and by their professional organisations."
"The rapporteur has worked very hard and with the help of committed colleagues on the Committee has achieved a remarkable partial success."
"But it is not an ideal solution."
"The plenary is therefore now faced with a tremendous number of amendments."
"I myself have tabled 50 amendments on behalf of the Group of Social Democrats and Socialists with a view to turning a good intention into a good directive."
"On the one hand, our amendments are designed to encourage professional mobility and freedom of establishment within the Union."
"At the same time, with consumer interests in mind we want to help to ensure that high-quality services can be offered everywhere."
"That requires rules and conditions, which, on the other hand, we want to keep to a necessary minimum."
"Only if we prevent a bureaucratic jungle from growing in the first place will we create genuine freedom of movement and mobility."
"With these objectives in mind and wanting to reach a good outcome, I have spent a lot of time listening attentively in the last few months."
"We then consulted fellow Members here in the House and looked for ways to safeguard the livelihoods of the persons concerned today and to give their professions a bright future in Europe tomorrow."
"The result of those consultations is embodied in amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"All you need to do is to agree to them, and we will have a good directive on the recognition of professional qualifications."
"I would just like to add a few words to Mr Harbour. We have had a lot of discussions with engineers and I have listened to them very carefully and I entirely understand your approach."
"Perhaps your group will be able to vote in favour of one of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which proposes that engineers join together on a platform that will find consensus in their profession, and we might be able to include that consensus at a later date in further deliberations about the directive we are discussing today."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, fellow MEPs and of course the Commissioner and his staff, because producing this report was a difficult business."
"The intention was to simplify the 15 existing directives, which will bring more legal certainty, but, above all, more dynamism and labour mobility."
"I think that that is necessary in order to optimise the internal market, which is, after all, one of the European Union's cornerstones."
"This is still lacking, because there are still virtual borders hindering mobility."
"I am therefore pleased with this directive, which could possibly contribute to more labour mobility."
"I would also like to thank Mr Zappalá for the constructive manner in which he has tried eventually to put the complex proposals that were before us into what is, hopefully, a workable and improved shape by means of compromise amendments."
"However, I, along with the Liberal Group, also have a few points of criticism."
"There is, for example, the time criterion."
"In our view, not too much consideration should be given to the duration of training, which is of less importance than its quality."
"We should therefore arrive at a points system that reflects the quality of training, because I can imagine that training courses leading up to a certain qualification last four years in some countries, and five or six years in others, while the quality is the same."
"However, according to the proposal regarding the time criterion, different levels should be awarded."
"I am not in favour of that and I hope that Amendment No 12, which I tabled and which is, admittedly, included in the preamble, will eventually be included in the legislative text possibly following consultation with the rapporteur."
"I am also of the opinion that the rights and duties for professions with a certain liability and responsibility in public health should be tightened up."
"I am mainly referring to the medical and socio-medical professions."
"I think that those professions should be subject to mandatory registration."
"I am, above all, also thinking of the requirements that are prescribed in the Member State to which people move in order to work, for example compulsory liability insurance."
"I hope that we will find a solution for this."
"I should now like to turn to an aspect that I regard as important, namely access to the labour market."
"The Commission proposal states that people need to have worked for two out of the past ten years."
"In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, this has been changed to two years over the past five years."
"I think this discriminates against a number of groups, including women who start a family, have children and then return to work."
"They would then have to work in a Member State for two years before they can access Europe."
"I would like to urge this House to keep to the Commission proposal of two years out of the past ten."
"I will also be asking for a roll-call vote on this."
"While I welcome the fact that advisory platforms will be set up, I would ask you not to extend these to national platforms, for that would make the whole thing too complex, and any attempts at arriving at a recommendation would then be chaotic."
"I think that we should persevere with the Commission proposal to organise it at European level."
"Finally, I hope that this directive will attract a large majority, so that we can make the internal market more efficient than it already is."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the purpose of the directive is to further liberalise the job market for the benefit of big business; at the same time, it strikes at the heart of the labour and vocational rights of the very few categories of workers who still have such rights."
"Within these frameworks, it aims to maximise the potential for companies to guarantee an abundance of skilled manpower, so that they can choose as much as they need, as and when they need it, so as to depress the price of manpower, trample the workers' rights and vested interests underfoot and, generally, enhance the exploitation of scientific manpower."
"At the same time, this is an indirect but clear intervention in the education systems of the Member States, despite the provision to the contrary in the Treaty of the European Union."
"The distinction between vocational and academic equivalence is the means of imposing an education model which limits the breadth and depth of higher education to the minimum demands of companies; in other words, it is far below the academically acceptable level."
"It is an education model which downgrades higher education as a whole and creates specialised scientific manpower with no depth of knowledge and hence no demands."
"As far as the content of the directive is concerned, we would point out that, on the pretext of simplifying recognition procedures, the minimum preconditions set for access to scientific professions safeguarded under the law are much lower than those which already apply in numerous countries in the European Union and in Greece."
"Every Member State is obliged to allow any foreign national or local to pursue their profession, provided they have a diploma accepted by another Member State for the pursuit of that profession, irrespective of the standard of the diploma."
"In other words, a mechanic who has graduated from a three-year course automatically acquires the same professional rights as a graduate from a five-year course at a Greek polytechnic."
"In addition, the directive puts all post-secondary education diplomas on the same footing, be they from a higher education institution or from a vocational school."
"Even vocational experience or practical exercise can, according to the directive, be equated to a three-year or five-year course."
"For Greece in particular, the directive intervenes indirectly and creates in order to bring to a close outstanding education issues on which there is acute confrontation and controversy on the part of the interested parties."
"Thus, for example, Articles 12 and 13 and certain amendments impose vocational equivalence between graduates of liberal studies centres which have signed contracts with foreign universities and graduates from Greek universities, even though these studies are not recognised as higher studies in Greece."
"In order to implement the foregoing and circumvent any possible obstacle at national level, the directive endeavours to regulate every possible case in detail and to preclude any possible derogation."
"It even introduces a single specialist committee to recognise vocational qualifications and control progress in the application of the operation."
"For these reasons, we are categorically opposed to the directive."
"We propose that academic equivalence should be the basic precondition for the recognition of vocational equivalence, which should be granted on the basis of the terms of the host country."
"Similarly, we call for all the laboratories or study centres which enter into agreements with foreign universities and market their diplomas to be closed and for the franchising system to be abolished entirely in the field of university education."
"Mr President, with great respect to Mr Alyssandrakis, I have to differ with him."
"In common with most other colleagues who have spoken in the debate, I think this directive is going in the right direction and that we should all be pushing it as well as we can towards a conclusion."
"There are points of difference between us and these are important points."
"The grand idea of simplification, of bringing 15 different sectoral directives together into one overall scheme, is really an extraordinarily important one, not just for the reasons which Mr Harbour and others have mentioned, because of the completion of the single market, but also because of our responsibility as a Union to supply our citizens with reasonably clear and intelligible laws."
"If we can bring together the whole body of law concerning recognition of professions into a single coherent package, that is in itself a good thing in terms of the quality of the laws that we produce in this Union."
"It is important not to lose the particular protections that apply to different professions."
"It would be a very bad thing if you over-simplified, as Mr Bowis pointed out, to the point that you get rid of essential protections."
"For example, in relation to the provision of services in the health professions by health professionals."
"All of us have to confess, taking the example that he gave, that we can have very good professional qualifications and professional disciplinary tribunals and still people such as Dr Shipman can get through the net."
"That just shows the point, and it is a point which Mr Zappalà was making, that the relationship of professionals to other members of the community is a curious one: someone who goes to a professional for advice gives herself or himself over to the power of that person because the professional necessarily knows more about the client or patient's problem than the client or patient does or can."
"You would not have professions otherwise."
"That power relationship between professionals and citizens is one which requires regulation of the kind we have been talking about."
"It requires proper structures for example, the kind of structures that would emerge under some of the proposals from the committees and subcommittees that will deal with particular professions within the grander overall framework."
"Mr Alyssandrakis said that we are engaged in an effort of levelling down."
"I beg to differ."
"As a lifelong provider of a kind of professional training, as a professor of law, I would be the last to disparage the importance of on-the-job, in-practice training as well as the importance of the kind of work that I have spent a lot of my time doing classroom teaching, tutorials and so on."
"What is important, and Mr Harbour mentioned this, is the maintenance of the five levels that we already have."
"There have been some proposals to refine these yet further."
"I would certainly deplore that."
"I think we have an 'understood' set of five levels and these should be retained."
"They should also be clarified."
"Having read Amendments Nos 192 to 196 in the name of Mrs Kauppi, Mr Harbour and others, I think that does a rather elegant job and, in any event, between now and the final vote, it is up to us to try and bring it together in such a way that we get a clear, intelligible and workable package at the end of the day."
"The engineering case has been mentioned."
"There is a point here which we all share."
"With great respect, it is too soon to go as far as Mr Zappalà is suggesting at this stage."
"It is important that we get the engineers to a better condition of mutual understanding in the different countries and that we achieve a better situation so that someone who is entitled to call themselves an engineer in Italy can feel that the same applies to a chartered engineer in the United Kingdom, and ."
"We need to develop a common platform."
"Across the House there have been indications of movement towards agreement, and very important that is."
"It has been said that it is important in the single market to have free movement of labour to provide services. I agree with that."
"Since the beginning of my time in this Parliament, I have been involved in the case of the foreign language lecturers at Italian universities who had four judgments in their favour over 14 years and who are still not guaranteed or granted adequate rights of access to employment on the same terms as Italian nationals."
"That is just one example of why the work we are doing is of such vital importance if we are to have equal access to work and equal opportunity to provide services, with adequate protection for citizens and consumers across the Union."
"I strongly support the direction in which we are going and hope we manage to get home to port at the next plenary."
"Mr President, the purpose of the Zappalà report is very important in that, through mobility, which of course depends on the mutual recognition of qualifications, we are giving workers more opportunities within the framework of the single European market."
"Of course, the precondition to the success of such an endeavour is recognition of university diplomas."
"In Greece, there is a particular problem in this respect."
"Because no private universities have yet been opened, we have the world record in student migration."
"Because of this situation, European universities cooperate with so-called liberal studies centres in Greece."
"These diplomas are not recognised by the State and the social problem of thousands of people is escalating."
"We have raised this matter with the Commission in the past, both I and honourable Members on the left, excluding Mr Alyssandrakis, and the European Commission was perfectly clear on it."
"It says that the diplomas must be recognised."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities said likewise recently in the Neri case, which concerned a similar matter in Italy."
"However, because the problems of the Greek education system are dragging on, I tabled an amendment which was approved in committee, so that European diplomas could be recognised as soon as possible, without needless legal obstacles and without Greece being condemned by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and so that reputable European universities could open annexes in Greece under a regime of legal certainty, in order to raise the level of courses through competition and put a stop to student migration."
"In order to avoid any misunderstanding about the level of courses, we tabled a second amendment, together with Mr Trakatellis and Mr Zappalà, which states the obvious, i.e. that the Member States are entitled to subject the various institutions cooperating with universities in other Member States to the control mechanisms which apply to their own universities."
"In Greece in the past few days, after the outcry which arose, the leadership of the Socialist Party changed its mind on private higher education."
"It makes sense in the light of this change to adopt our amendments and I hope that this will become clear, Mr President, during the vote."
"Mr President, we need to bear two guidelines in mind when deciding whether or not to accept the proposed amendments."
"The first is that it will be much easier for the liberal professions to move around than it has been to date, especially for those who exercise regulated professions."
"The aim here is to develop the internal market and the service sector, which is lagging behind."
"The second guideline we need to lay down is quality assurance of the services provided during cross-border movements."
"Within this context, we need to examine the basic innovations of the proposed directive, such as distinguishing between the cross-border provision of services and cross-border establishment, the proposed levels and so on. As regards the cross-border provision of services in particular, I think that amendments which set terms and conditions in order to prevent infringements should be accepted."
"On the other hand, the innovation in the directive introducing the concept of common bases should be especially welcomed, because it gives the liberalised agencies the opportunity to take an active part in strengthening their cross-border cooperation."
"Now there is an opening in civil society; however, if we are to safeguard consumer interests on the basis of the second guideline which we referred to earlier, we have a reasonable interest in calling on the Community legislator not to turn mobility into a pretext for undermining the level of training of the professions on the move."
"That is why it is important, where diplomas certifying a theoretical education are granted to diploma holders who study in various countries, that we demand as a that their courses be held in every country by recognised education establishments and not by companies which do not fall within the official education system of the host country."
"We all need to agree on this if we do not want to put the product of education on the same footing as an uncontrolled industrial product."
"Consequently, it is one thing for us to encourage cooperation between universities – or even, if you like, between universities and other education establishments, on which no-one can disagree – and it is quite another thing, under cover of cooperation, for us to indirectly allow units not recognised as education agencies by legislation to be recognised as such."
"That is why the amendment proposed by Mr Hatzidakis is a dangerous amendment."
"Mr President, we can very often be proud of the work that we – as distinct from the Council and the Member States, for example – do to turn the Lisbon agenda into a reality."
"We cannot, however, be particularly proud of our work on this occasion."
"Since the Commission put forward its proposal, it has taken us 22 months to arrive at the first reading and, just as Mr Harbour stated earlier, clarification is required to prevent those of our fellow MEPs who are less familiar with our procedures from being confused during the vote."
"I wish to support a lot of what Mrs Gebhardt said in her speech."
"At the same time, I wish to take the opportunity to congratulate her on her birthday next week."
"We cannot perhaps all be with you, but I hope that you have a splendid day and that we can hear all about it."
"Listening to the debate on these issues, you often get the feeling that every country has the world’s best education system."
"One of the biggest advantages of being here in the European Parliament is perhaps that of learning a certain humility in this respect."
"I have deliberately devoted a lot of time to the Committee on Petitions, which also deals with citizens’ complaints, because I agree with Mr MacCormick that there are problems for different types of teacher, something that also applies to crane operators from different countries."
"I myself have, for example, worked for a long time with a crane operator, Mr Holmström, from the Swedish-speaking Åland Islands."
"He has not succeeded in obtaining recognition in Finland for the crane operator’s examination he took in Sweden."
"Nyland’s worker protection district has always opposed his doing so, and I believe that many of you are surprised that there are such problems between Finland and Sweden, two countries that nonetheless have a very great deal in common with each other."
"This is an example of how people believe that they themselves have the best education system of all."
"At the same time as wishing to thank the Commission for its proposal for a new directive in the field of the internal market and services, I wish to sound a word of warning."
"We must not again act in a way that makes it simpler for companies than for individuals to move across our borders."
"Far too often, the result of our action is that individuals are not given access to freedom of movement and the internal market in the way that we should desire."
"As we heard earlier, our group will support the Commission’s proposal in many respects."
"We also want to have a flexible directive but, unlike some of the other groups, we do not want the annexes to form part of the text."
"I am, however, pleased to see that regulations concerning language requirements are being introduced that are more precise than those put forward by the Commission."
"– Mr President, I would like firstly, of course, to congratulate the Commission on this proposal – and its team, which has had the patience to discuss each of the amendments with all of us."
"I believe this is laudable, because it does not happen very often and I wanted to mention it here."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Zappalà on the work he has done, on having to endure the enormous number of amendments, and also on his speech in plenary, which has clarified things."
"There is no question that this is an extremely important Directive in terms of making progress on free movement, and I agree with the words of Mrs Thors, who said that it cannot be easier to establish companies than it is for individuals to establish themselves when they wish to carry out a profession."
"The free movement of professionals within the Union is vital, and I am delighted that we are also talking about the recognition of professional qualifications for all professions, and not just some of them."
"I believe that the professionals which we sometimes call intellectuals, engineers or those with a high level of qualifications, have as much right as those with lesser qualifications."
"It is true that there have been many controversial points."
"I believe that the division between the free provision of services and freedom of establishment according to the sixteen weeks criterion was very difficult to justify."
"I believe that, in this regard, we should establish, as we have done in committee, a rule for each profession, since a tour guide is not the same as an engineer when they go to another country to provide a service for a few weeks."
"We must find a balance between freedom of movement and guaranteeing the quality of service, as well as fair competition between the people exercising a profession within a Member State and people who come from another country to exercise it."
"There are other aspects which I believe to be particularly important, such as establishing special characteristics for each of the professions and certain exceptions like the ones we have established – and I would mention the case of notaries, for example."
"Specifically with regard to engineers, I too, as an engineer, would like to point out that the amendments we have presented jointly with Mr Harbour – from No 192 to No 196 – clearly establish those professional levels – from one to five – and there are other amendments which I will support, together with Mr Harbour, aimed at specifically defining the profession of engineer."
"I believe that some of the aspects introduced by Mr Zappalà are premature, as has been said in this House, and I would ask that a common platform be established for engineers."
"– Mr President, some 15 years ago, as a young academic, I applied for and was offered a post at the Free University of Berlin."
"As a result of the problem of mutual recognition of qualifications, many months passed before I was able to take up my position."
"This directive must, I believe, ensure that professionals do not face the same uncertainty and obstacles I encountered in exercising the right, as an EU citizen, to exercise one's profession in the single market."
"Moreover, if the Commissioner's new plan for a radical freeing-up of the market for cross-border services is to succeed, the free movement of skilled professionals will be vital to it."
"Specific safeguards are necessary in the health care sector."
"I too tabled amendments to abolish the 16-week rule."
"I thank the rapporteur and the committee for supporting those amendments."
"It is true that the rule would possibly have allowed bogus health care professionals and those struck off for malpractice to work in another Member State without having to register with the host country's regulatory body."
"Mr Bowis mentioned the case of Dr Shipman, a doctor in my constituency who may have murdered up to 200 patients after forcing some of them to change their wills in his favour."
"However, Dr Shipman was not struck off for malpractice and he was never identified as a problem by the UK's own regulatory body."
"Patient health and safety must be paramount, but it must not be an excuse to block the free movement of professionals."
"I know that Commissioner Bolkestein is sensitive to this issue."
"In the UK, the legacy of a Conservative government is an acute shortage of doctors."
"It makes no sense to have barriers to free movement, but I hope that the final directive gets the balance right between allowing and encouraging the free movement of health care professionals, plus automatic recognition of rights for more than 50 categories of medical specialist – in particular much-needed cancer specialists, and continuing to safeguard patient health and safety."
"Mr President, the new directive calls for a uniform, transparent and flexible regime for the recognition of professional qualifications in order to facilitate the free movement of qualified persons within the enlarged European Union."
"It is based on the existing general systems directives and aims to consolidate 15 directives into one streamlined and simplified piece of legislation, which hopefully will clarify issues of interpretation."
"As such it is an ambitious and wide-ranging directive, very much in line with the agenda set out in the Commission's action plan for skills and mobility."
"However, it comes with a health warning."
"The promotion of liberalisation and mobility must not be achieved at the expense of public health and consumer protection."
"On this count I welcome the maintenance of a clear separation between the two existing regimes for the recognition of professional qualifications: the sectoral regime covering seven regulated professions and a general regime."
"It is important for the more stringent set of rules to apply to the provision of services for sectoral regimes."
"We must highlight the areas where the degree of public risk warrants a prior check on qualifications for the first provision of services."
"In addition, we must ensure that the list of specialities included in the proposal is comprehensive enough to ensure due recognition and regulatory protection is accorded to emerging disciplines, such as medical oncology – the whole area of the research and treatment of cancer."
"It is important for mobile professionals to realise that they must be proficient in the language of their host country since the ability to communicate is a prerequisite for practising."
"It is particularly important in the medical field where there are serious health and safety issues should patients be unable to communicate with the doctor in their own language."
"I would like to express my support for the concept of including a new special section for the engineering profession, as introduced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"As regards the architecture profession, however, I would like to draw attention to the issue of Recital 21."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has voted through an amendment tabled by Lord Inglewood which would recognise surveyors as being qualified to design buildings."
"The problem here lies in the way the role of surveyors is interpreted across the Community."
"Outside the UK and Ireland they do not carry out building design."
"This ambiguity in the role and responsibilities of surveyors across Europe needs to be rectified in order to ensure a harmonised system and a level playing field."
"My original amendment on this issue at committee stage was not adopted, but its wording could provide a solution to this major problem."
"It preserves the wording of the architects directive, which is part of the ,and would ensure continuity of understanding in the way this provision is interpreted under the new system."
"I share the concerns expressed by the Irish presidency and others that the timescale proposed under Articles 5 to 9 of the directive are simply not achievable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the original purpose of this directive was to simplify matters, to ensure as part of the ‘SLIM’ programme that the number of European legal texts should be reduced as far as possible and that they should be made easier for the citizen to understand."
"I have massive doubts as to whether we have really succeeded with this proposal for a directive."
"As we all know, the European Union has for decades had workable sectoral directives for a whole series of skilled occupations, which were developed specifically to create suitable conditions for recognition in those occupations."
"If we are now approaching them on the principle that they should all be lumped together and there should be one directive applying as much to master carpenters as to medical consultants and surgeons, then I am convinced that nothing sensible can come of it in the end."
"That is why the majority of my group wanted to keep the sectoral directives."
"The fact is that most of the complaints received were not about the regulated areas but about those areas that were not regulated, that is to say, the areas not covered by the sectoral directives."
"We were unable to get the Committee to accept this view."
"The result now is obviously that there will have to be a large number of amendments taking more and more elements from the sectoral directives into the general directive."
"The outcome cannot be described as something that has produced a simplification of legislation in Europe, quite the opposite, it has all become more bureaucratic, more complicated, harder to understand and more inefficient, the opposite of ‘slim’, I would call the directive ‘thick’, to borrow the English word."
"Not to mention that I do not of course believe it is a good way of legislating to adopt a directive on medical consultants that is then not even implemented in the Member States but rescinded again and finally incorporated into this directive."
"In short, the consultations were in the end about preventing something worse rather than achieving something good."
"What the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has come up with has prevented something worse, but it has not done any good."
"We will vote in favour of this outcome given that nothing else could be achieved."
"– Mr President, I am speaking without having heard the debate because I had a prior engagement in the Bureau."
"Having steered the work of the committee for so long, I can say that the matter was subjected to detailed discussion and analysed in depth and underwent the procedure duly required for such an important provision, a provision that is one of the most important currently under Parliament’s scrutiny."
"We started with a hearing that lasted a whole day and brought to our attention problems dealt with in depth by the rapporteur and other members of the committee – Mr Zappalà, Mr Lehne and others whom I thank – and, as a result of various debates and speeches, we reached today’s conclusion."
"We have a major ambition: we want to lay down regulations governing the intellectual professions."
"I believe that we are effectively opening up Europe to the right of citizenship and cultural organisation so that Europe can be achieved by means not just of the single currency and all the measures we are advancing, but above all by making citizens aware of the interconnectedness of the intellectual professions: the possibility of carrying out professional activities at the highest level within the various Member States and within various European organisations."
"Mr Zappalà has pushed this directive forward by finding a balance which, it must be said, differs from that of the Commission, a balance more in keeping with the demands of the professional world and of citizens, at the heart of which lies above all the quality of information."
"We need to ensure that the professions are qualified to the highest standards so that, within the Member States, professional persons are accepted on the basis of the qualifications they possess."
"I believe that, in doing this, we are making a major contribution to Europe and providing a service for its citizens."
"I also believe that communications between different European countries is determined at this level: the intellectual professions have been throughout history – not just in Italy but in all countries – a major reference point in relation to a country’s standing."
"Finally, I believe that the professions, once they come under a single definition within Europe, are capable of making a contribution that can be surpassed only by the Constitution, once it is ratified."
"Nevertheless, this is an important contribution to the Constitution and to European citizenship."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the Lisbon objective of becoming the most competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based society by 2010, this is not just a question of economic and industrial policy but above all a question of education and training."
"Another area is the operation of the labour market and how it is changing as a matter of necessity."
"At the interface between the two areas lie the efforts to promote high quality training and further training and the protection of mutual cross-border recognition of professional qualifications."
"I therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal."
"In my address today I would like to go into one aspect in particular, namely the equality, in terms of level and conditions, of the professional qualifications of service providers and for freedom of establishment."
"The requirements for the activity are the same, regardless of whether we are talking about a service or an establishment."
"The activities are no different."
"I cannot therefore understand why recognition of professional qualifications is provided for establishment, but no provision is made for the recognition of professional qualifications for the provision of services."
"I do not think this distinction is right."
"The present arrangement may even be contrary to Article 50 of the EC Treaty."
"This allows services to be provided in an EU Member State subject to the same conditions as that State prescribes for its own nationals."
"The conditions include equivalence of evidence of qualifications, provided such evidence is required in the host Member State."
"To remove this problem, I ask you to vote in favour of Amendment No 213 tabled by Mr Zappalà and myself."
"– Before giving the floor again to the Commissioner, I note that, in order to avoid him having to spend all the time available to him reading out numbers, the integrated Minutes will contain the list of all the amendments the Commission is considering accepting in their entirety, accepting partially with certain modifications or rejecting."
"The list will be annexed to the Minutes so that the Commissioner will not have to read out a long list of numbers."
"Mr President, I shall explain some of the key points that may be of interest to Members of Parliament, in particular the amendments tabled by this Parliament."
"I shall summarise my reply at the end of this debate in five points."
"Firstly, some amendments call into question the current legislation and cannot therefore be accepted."
"This concerns particularly the limitation of the scope of application of the directive to liberal professions, the suppression of the recognition of formal qualifications for many crafts and trades professions, the limitation of recognition to qualifications at the same level and the several other more restrictive requirements for recognition."
"My second point concerns facilitation of cross-border service provision."
"A real simplification of temporary and occasional service provision implies less formalities."
"Adequate guarantees to consumers can be provided through comprehensive information, and declarations to competent authorities and pro-forma registration can be accepted for healthcare professions."
"In any case, formal control of qualifications by host Member States is not compatible with a real facilitation of cross-border service provision."
"Thirdly, consolidation is not the appropriate framework for the introduction of new harmonising provisions; that requires in-depth consideration by all the interested parties and a specific impact assessment."
"Fourthly, enlargement justifies a simpler organisation of recognition systems."
"Community procedures have to be limited to Union-wide measures and this fully justifies the new approach for recognition of medical and dental specialities common to only some Member States, which will improve the likelihood of their continuing development."
"Fifthly, enlargement also demands simpler management mechanisms, particularly through one single comitology committee."
"The Commission is willing to contribute to this goal by setting up an expert group and by introducing more open and flexible consultation mechanisms with interested parties."
"The Commission's opinion on the individual amendments of which there are many, as we all know has been provided in writing and will be distributed shortly.(2)"
"Furthermore, I am confident that the valuable efforts made by the European Parliament will provide a good basis for further constructive discussions."
"Lastly, I should also like to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her birthday next week."
"Thank you, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on 29 January 2004."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"– (A5-0466/2003) by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct and indirect taxation (COM(2003) 446 – C5-0370/2003 – 2003/0170(COD))"
"– (A5-0476/2003) by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the future of Hedge Funds and Derivatives (2003/2082(INI))."
". Madam President, with regard to these two subjects, I will speak first on the Kauppi Report and then on the Purvis Report."
"On the Kauppi Report on mutual assistance, the Commission made this proposal in response to the report of the Council's Ad Hoc Group on Tax Fraud."
"The group had indicated that the base directive, which dates from 1977, was in need of modernisation in view of the increased tendency for businesses to be organised in several Member States and for individuals to exercise their Treaty rights of free movement."
"Nevertheless, any tax liabilities that arise as a consequence of those rights should be capable of enforcement by the tax authorities of the Member States concerned."
"Practices of tax evasion and tax avoidance across frontiers violate the principle of fair taxation, are likely to result in distortions in capital movements, adversely affect conditions of competition and affect the proper functioning of the internal market."
"This proposal adds to the existing tools available to tax administrations."
"It accelerates the procedures involved in obtaining information from other states' tax administrations."
"It makes it possible to carry out simultaneous tax checks in a number of countries where a multinational business operates, and it allows decisions and instruments to be notified outside the country where the tax is owed, so that enforcement proceedings may be pursued."
"As a measure designed to combat tax fraud and tax avoidance, I am certain that Parliament will want to support it."
"Those are my initial comments on the Kauppi Report."
"With regard to the Purvis Report, I should like to say the following."
"The Commission welcomes the decision of the European Parliament to draw up a report on the future of hedge funds and derivatives."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative, which is very timely."
"These subjects, as we all know, are extremely important."
"Let me first address the issue of hedge funds."
"As mentioned in Mr Purvis' report, various hedge fund products are already accessible to retail investors, either directly through stock exchange listings or indirectly through structured notes."
"Several Member States have already introduced a regulatory regime for hedge funds to encourage such undertakings to set themselves up under their jurisdiction."
"However, as Mr Purvis correctly mentions in his report, there is currently no European regulatory regime that is tailored to the particularities of hedge funds."
"There are at least two key questions: first, how to attract on-shore investments that are mostly off-shore nowadays."
"Parmalat, , has shown the importance of that."
"Secondly, what level of protection do investors need for this specific type of financial product?"
"On this basis, it would seem appropriate to discuss the potential benefits of an EU-wide regulatory regime for hedge funds."
"As regards the second issue, derivatives, I agree that this is another crucial issue for at least three reasons."
"First, this category of financial instruments is developing at an increasing rate with endless imagination in the form of new products."
"Secondly, most of them are traded on over-the-counter markets which, by their very nature, are less-well monitored than regulated markets by regulators and supervisors."
"Thirdly, the risks attached to such instruments are potentially large because of their leverage effects."
"However, in contrast to hedge funds, which are not covered by European legislation at the moment, derivatives are already dealt with in a number of texts in different contexts such as, for example, accounting, ICITS, market abuse, investment services or banking legislation."
"It would seem neither necessary nor desirable to build a specific piece of legislation for derivatives as it is a horizontal issue."
"The best way would be to consider updating the current different pieces of European legislation on a case-by-case basis."
"However, full tax consistency must be assured."
"In the cases of both hedge funds and derivatives, Mr Purvis' final report is helpful guidance for the European Commission."
"The Commission committed itself in Oviedo in April 2002 to examine specifically the issues of derivatives and hedge funds after the Enron scandal."
"This commitment will be respected and Mr Purvis' report will be taken duly into account."
"The European Commission will also have to take into consideration the conclusions to be drawn by the professional experts groups that we set up in late October 2003 to consider post-FSAP priorities – priorities after completion of the Financial Services Action Plan."
"Those experts groups may raise these two issues, among others, upon the first report scheduled for April 2004."
"It is too early for the European Commission to take a final position on possible further legislative action regarding either hedge funds or derivatives."
"We shall have to analyse whether the Parmalat affair resonates on these two subjects and we shall have to be attentive to the on-going debates in the United States on registration of hedge funds to ensure that there are no distortions to competition."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, I am not Mrs Kauppi, but she is the rapporteur, and I am not."
"She has asked me to present this report briefly for her today because a week ago she became a mother."
"On behalf of this House and on my own behalf I would like to offer her our warmest congratulations."
"She is the mother of a strapping boy, both are doing well and she would like to combine work and family as quickly as possible and resume her work in this House."
"Warm congratulations, Piia, and all the best!"
"Turning to her report on the Commission proposal, I can say that it does not criticise the Commission, neither does it raise any cause for concern as to how the Commission has proceeded, but rather as to how the Council has proceeded."
"Essentially, the Commission proposal seeks to achieve for direct taxation what has already been proposed elsewhere for indirect taxation."
"The main innovations are the introduction of the possibility for two or more Member States to carry out joint controls where a taxable person is active in more than one Member State, that is, it is a question of common sense and an orderly shaping of the single market."
"A second point is the simplification of the procedure and a third the removal of ambiguities from the present text which, as we have heard, is already 25 years old and anyone with their eyes and ears open knows that a lot has been done and changed in that time."
"The main problem is one of procedure."
"In keeping with its normal practice, the Commission has based its proposal on Article 95 of the Treaty, which means that the codecision procedure applies to this proposal."
"Parliament has always supported this choice of legal basis, for reasons that are easy to understand, and I would also like to say why, namely that we are of the opinion that administrative cooperation does not affect material tax law, but rather seeks to ensure that the single market works well."
"We therefore welcome the Commission’s legal stance and we would point out that the Council has already on several occasions decided unilaterally to change the legal basis to either Article 93 or Article 94 of the Treaty without giving any convincing reasons, in so doing removing Parliament’s right of codecision and understating the measure’s importance for the single market."
"The most recent case concerned two Commission proposals on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and an amendment to Directive 77/799/EEC, where the Council has recently re-consulted Parliament on the change in legal basis."
"Parliament rejected that request on 2 September 2003."
"Since we anticipate that the Council will also change the legal basis for the present proposal, the rapporteur sees no reason to change or re-evaluate her position at this juncture and we therefore propose that the Commission draft be approved in full as proposed on the basis of Article 95."
"By so doing, we will also be showing with a broad majority that we are ready, minded and determined to co-decide in this matter, because we believe it concerns the single market."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his considered views and I hope, even if he defers to his expert panels, that he will take into account the fact that this area most probably deserves legislation in the future."
"I shall run through the main reasons for our view of this."
"The first hedge fund was established back in 1949 and, as of now, assets under management globally are estimated at some EUR 600 billion."
"Of these, about 15%, or EUR 90 billion, are managed from Europe."
"Even if European investment managers manage them, most of them are still domiciled in offshore tax and regulatory havens."
"There has been a huge increase in interest in this type of investment in recent years, especially in the United States, where affluent and moderately affluent investors have discovered them."
"Many institutional investors now find it acceptable to invest in this way."
"This interest has now spread to Europe, especially as many of these funds, because of their willingness to sell short and leverage their results, have performed well in absolute terms over the last three years of negative stock market performance."
"The media has picked up on this, and such performances are featured in the personal finance sections of the newspapers."
"As a result there is some concern that less and less sophisticated investors will be tempted to entrust their savings to risky offshore hedge funds by one means or another."
"Even if most of these are perfectly respectable, well-administered and managed, there is only very basic regulatory control."
"EU regulators are concerned about the risks that may be run, while the investment industry is attracted by the commercial opportunities of tapping into this trend."
"We consider that it is an opportune time to introduce an appropriately light-handed regime in the European Union that will attract those funds to set up within European jurisdictions."
"This view is further strengthened by the initiatives of certain Member States, which have introduced or are considering introducing such facilitating regimes at the national level."
"Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg are three such examples."
"Another matter of concern in the context of our attempts to produce a single European capital and investment market, is that some Member States impose fiscal or regulatory conditions which discriminate against investment into such funds in other Member States."
"We therefore propose that a distinct light-handed regime be established which can accommodate the characteristics of hedge funds – and also, incidentally, other alternative investment vehicles which currently lack a suitable legal home at an EU level."
"We are looking for an arrangement which can provide these vehicles with an EU passport on the basis of mutual recognition."
"These funds invest in areas such as property, currencies and commodities."
"Clearly these investments are not appropriate for everyone, at least until their awareness of the risks they carry are fully understood and appreciated."
"For this reason, we stress the absolute necessity of education, of clear and straightforward information and of strict regulatory control of those who sell and distribute such products."
"There is no reason to deny European citizens access to these interesting investment opportunities, but we feel their interests will be better safeguarded if these are available within EU jurisdictions and are subject to appropriate regulation."
"They will also provide opportunities for our European investment professionals to enhance their skills and build high-value businesses and jobs."
"Capital will also be attracted to our businesses and industries here in Europe, rather than in America and other parts of the world."
"A separate section of my report is devoted to derivatives."
"These are widely used in both mainstream business and industry and in the investment world."
"While they are often vilified as high-risk speculative instruments, in fact, they can just as readily be applied – and are – in order to limit and reduce risk."
"We have identified two main issues – Mr Bolkestein identified three – which deserve attention."
"Systemic risks to the world's financial system could possibly occur because we have little or no way of quantifying the full extent of exposure."
"This applies especially to specialised derivatives which are dealt over the counter and tend to be less liquid than more conventional derivatives."
"This also applies to credit derivatives, whose use has exploded, as banks offload – for capital adequacy reasons – their assets onto non-banks including, incidentally, hedge funds."
"We therefore call on the Commission, and the various international institutions, to develop appropriate means to measure, monitor and control such outstandings."
"Madam President, I shall start with the Kauppi report – and I join in the congratulations to Mrs Kauppi on the birth of her son this week."
"As has been noted, the title of this proposed directive, which will overhaul the existing mutual assistance directive, is slightly misleading, given that it will only, in effect, apply to direct taxation and insurance, indirect taxation in the form of VAT and excise duties being dealt with in separate instruments."
"That should be clarified."
"The thrust of this proposal is to prevent tax evaders from hiding in other Member States by establishing, on a voluntary basis, provisions for cooperation and mutual agreement in conducting tax controls."
"This will be a welcome advance."
"The change of legal basis from one relying on QMV – Article 95 – to one providing for unanimous voting by the Council – Articles 93 and 94 of the Treaty – is very much in line with precedent and, fortunately, with my own government's position on tax legislation."
"It is not possible to separate the administrative element of taxation powers, including mutual assistance provisions, from the tax raising prerogative and this should remain subject to unanimous voting."
"I turn to the report by Mr Purvis."
"I congratulate him on a very balanced and informative report, notwithstanding the slightly odd decision to link these two topics – hedge funds and derivatives – in a single report, as trade in derivatives is already far more regulated in the EU than the area of hedge funds."
"As mentioned in his report, Ireland has been extremely active and successful in broadening access to hedge funds."
"However, a clear regulatory framework must be put in place to secure minimum protection for investors while expanding Europe's paltry 15% share of total global hedge fund assets."
"SAIVs – sophisticated alternative investment vehicles, or hedge funds, as they are generally known – and derivatives have benefited over the last few years from the stock market downturn, as they did from the widening of the field of investors that the stock market experienced during the booming 1990s, when areas of investment that had previously been largely confined to experienced and qualified financial experts or fund managers were democratised as individuals and smaller groups new to the market put their money into shares at that time. I agree that we need an appropriate EU-wide regulatory regime for hedge funds which will prompt them to locate in the EU, rather than offshore, and provide the benefits of a common European passport through mutual recognition."
"However, we need to take a suitable light-touch approach to regulation in order to provide incentives that will encourage investment in funds based in the EU rather than continue to drive them offshore."
"Coordination of national regulators will provide for more flexibility within the single market, which is welcome."
"With regard to derivatives, I support the timely call for the Commission to present a report on their role on the capital markets."
"Madam President, the term ‘sophisticated alternative investment vehicles’ is such a sophisticated phrase that I shall replace it with the expression ‘hedge funds’."
"The Socialist Group does not consider hedge funds in particular or derivatives in general to be particularly wonderful."
"These instruments are to some extent useful in covering certain investment risks or risks linked to international trade."
"Given, however, that all of these financial instruments are highly speculative – indeed with very limited leverage, phenomenal sums can be raised – one simply has to be careful."
"My Group supports the Commission’s prudent approach in this regard and we agree with the argument that Commissioner Bolkestein has just put forward."
"Enron, Parmalat and other scandals have reminded us that sophisticated products often conceal highly sophisticated financial wrongdoing."
"The near-collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund revealed the scale of the risks involved."
"At the beginning of 1998, LTCM had USD 4.8 billion of its own funds to meet liabilities worth USD 120 billion, in other words, a leverage of 25."
"By 23 September 1998, LTCM’s net assets had fallen to USD 600 million, with liabilities of around USD 100 billion, or a leverage of 167."
"The rescue of LTCM, which entailed neither penalties nor consequences for the fund managers, avoided a chain reaction, but who can guarantee that similar events will not happen again, this time on a scale that will make any rescue impossible?"
"The capital with which LTCM started operating essentially came from banks which were, in theory, monitored."
"We must, therefore, toughen the prudential requirements set for banks when they underwrite speculative funds."
"Because many of these funds are domiciled in offshore centres that are unregulated or barely regulated, the simplest way of countering hedge funds that wish to remain opaque would be to make it more difficult and onerous for them to obtain refinancing from banks operating in countries covered by the Basle Accords."
"Bank loans could be strictly limited, in line with the amount of collateral provided by funds domiciled offshore."
"The Financial Stability Forum, the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the Basle Committee for Banking Supervision have all made important recommendations and suggestions on this matter, in particular in the Brok/Mayer report of January 2000."
"To date, none of these proposals has been translated into action."
"Mr Purvis’s report seeks to arrange a comeback for hedge funds in Europe and to gradually open their products to ‘moderately affluent investors’."
"Personally, I am not quite sure what a moderately affluent investor is, but my group is not opposed to such a move, on the condition that there is much more transparency as regards hedge funds and that national and, in future, even European regulators authorise and monitor this process."
"Indeed, we must not forget that in this murky area, significant gains necessarily entail substantial risks."
"I shall finish, Madam President, by thanking Mr Purvis for this report which is, on the whole, extremely constructive."
"I thank him for his open-mindedness and for having accepted some compromises, which will allow my group to vote in favour of his report."
"I will also end by addressing my personal congratulations and those of my group to Mrs Kauppi, on her report, but especially on the happy event that has just been announced."
"– Madam President, I know the rapporteur, Mr Purvis."
"He believes in the market."
"If you have such a belief the best option is light-handed regulation, and the lightest is obviously self-regulation."
"Mr Purvis justifies the existence of derivative markets with reference to olive production."
"In ancient times the price of olives was stabilised by means of agreements made beforehand."
"Olives in the European Union, however, are a good example of how the market functions if there is no control and only self-regulation."
"According to a report by the Court of Auditors, producers are falsifying production figures at their pressing plants, adding nut oil to olive oil or forwarding the same oil to the EU for payment on the basis of both the number of trees and the volume of oil."
"The market functions on the terms of the greedy, as do investment and the derivative markets."
"The new instruments work in the way oil is pressed from olives."
"The stock markets are the oil pressing plants for the new market instruments, where new cash is pressed from old."
"The derivatives are the new lubricant greasing the wheels of the machinery in the speculators’ market."
"The financial markets are supervised today in the same way as nuclear safety, something which was discussed this week in Parliament: only at national level."
"Those responsible for supervising nuclear plants are top-level technical specialists, whilst those responsible for the national supervision of hedge funds and derivatives are not."
"Accordingly, there is no stock market safety factor in the market."
"There should be a stock market safety authority just as there is a nuclear safety authority or, for example, a Maritime Safety Agency."
"I wish the report had examined more the role of the European Central Bank as a possible supervisory body."
"A lightly regulated regime and self-regulation rely on the morals of speculators, and, as we know, speculators do not have morals."
"Their incentive is merely a desire for money."
"As a result, the pensions of employees in companies in many countries are at great risk, as they are, for example, in Mr Purvis’s country."
"– Madam President, unlike the previous speaker, I will mainly be focusing on the directive for which Mrs Kauppi is the rapporteur."
"Tax avoidance and evasion is widely practised and there is a strong cross-border dimension to it."
"Cigarette smuggling, VAT carousels and undeclared bank accounts are only a few examples of the repertoire of those who do not want to give Caesar what belongs to him."
"In the European Union, but also, for example, in Switzerland and the Balkans, we have to look carefully for joint efforts to put effective monitoring in place particularly for taxpayers who are active in various Member States."
"The options provided in this directive for joint monitoring by two or more Member States are therefore of major importance."
"We are particularly referring, therefore, to the improved cooperation between the fiscal authorities of each of the Member States."
"This is wholly in keeping with the national prerogative of legislating on tax and collecting it."
"Fiscal legislation is a national responsibility and should remain so, tax being more closely interrelated with social structure and culture within each of the Member States."
"Against this backdrop, it is extremely odd that the discussion should not revolve around an effective approach to tax fraud but around the question of what legal basis this directive should have."
"This Parliament has rightly accepted Article 95 as a basis in comparable cases in order for the codecision procedure to apply."
"This is not about the content of tax legislation but about an implementing provision with regard to administrative cooperation, which is necessary in the internal market."
"What Mrs Kauppi predicted in her explanatory statement to her report has meanwhile come to pass: the Council has recently submitted a formal proposal to amend the legal basis."
"I would call this a knee-jerk response; the Council has once again rejected codecision without any clear arguments."
"Now that Parliament's position was confirmed on 2 September, this proposal too risks ending up before the Court of Justice."
"This would lead to unnecessary effort and expense and, above all, possibly long delays for the improved cooperation between the fiscal authorities, which is so desperately needed."
"I challenge the Council to jump over its own shadow."
"Back to basics: more effective controls of taxpayers who are active across the border."
"Tax-evaders move on from one base to another very quickly."
"The traditional exchange of information cannot possibly keep up."
"If a joint team of control officials from the relevant countries can establish that tax legislation has been misused and abused, a tit-for-tat approach is possible."
"The accession of ten new Member States will undoubtedly increase the need for transnational control teams."
"The open borders to countries with a still vulnerable administrative apparatus will, unfortunately, attract bounty hunters who have as few scruples in tax matters as they do in anything else."
"The sooner the tax authorities can fight this as one, the better."
"Madam President, it goes without saying that we must back the joint prosecution of tax fraud in Europe."
"However, the EU continues to be outsmarted by professional tax fraudsters because our systems are far too complex."
"We are flinging the doors open wide to such fraudsters and in so doing indirectly encouraging tax fraud."
"If we are to do anything effective against it, we need not only more effective controls and close cooperation, but also tax laws that are easy to understand."
"We urgently need a reform of our VAT system, for example."
"The highly complex dual VAT system where national sales are treated differently from EU sales is a major factor in billions being evaded relatively easily in the EU every year."
"That is why we need a simpler VAT system that is easier to understand and where all sales in Europe are treated in the same way and not differently, so that tax fraud can actually be combated effectively."
"Proposals have already been made to this effect; we only have to implement them."
"I therefore propose that we at last introduce the tax card into the VAT system and treat sales the same, not differently, so as to achieve the aims we have set by actually cutting tax fraud."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main conclusion of Mrs Kauppi’s report is undoubtedly the recognition that the rules governing mutual assistance in the field of taxation must be subject to the legal basis enshrined in Article 95 of the Treaty."
"In so doing, the institutional balance enshrined in this Treaty will be maintained, as will, more importantly, Parliament’s own prerogatives."
"Consequently, administrative cooperation does not affect material tax law, which means that it will no longer be required to be subject to the legal bases of Articles 93 and 94."
"What is crucial, however, is the fight against tax evasion, essential if the single market is to work well, which brings this under the remit of Article 95."
"I therefore endorse the Commission’s proposal."
"As regards the Purvis report, which deals with defining EU rules for personal investments and covers an enormous range of financial products, it appears to be absolutely essential to plug the current gap in the legislation."
"Indeed, the absence of clear rules regarding such investments has led to their being domiciled off-shore. This clearly damages the EU as a whole and leads to greater risks for more vulnerable investors."
"Various Member States are preparing to draw up their own legal regimes for hosting this kind of investment. It is therefore absolutely essential to attempt to harmonise and coordinate such regimes forthwith, subordinating them to the greater European interest."
"It should be remembered that we are speaking about innovative investment products offering highly attractive benefits, which means that they will be welcomed and encouraged by the market."
"Parliament has already looked into the problem of financial derivatives, highlighting the important role they currently play in capital markets, but, more importantly, spelling out the advantages and the risks involved."
"It therefore appears that the rapporteur is absolutely right that it is of crucial importance that we develop a regulatory regime that acts as an incentive to investors as regards hedge funds. He is also right to point out that legal uncertainty makes it very difficult to make use of derivatives markets in Member States."
"The rapporteur also suggests that the lack of regulation of certain varieties of derivative, such as ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives, represents a serious threat to the markets and especially to finance companies that are increasingly using this type of investment."
"The amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, addressing these very concerns, represent a significant improvement to the draft text, by guaranteeing greater insurance against the inherent risk in such investment practice, especially by making it compulsory to pass on more detailed and more accurate information to investors."
"For all of these reasons, the reports by Mrs Kauppi and Mr Purvis before us today, along with the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, must be approved by this House."
". Madam President, I shall make a few short remarks, firstly on the Kauppi report."
"Before I do so, however, I should like to join Parliament in congratulating Mrs Kauppi on the birth of her son."
"The legal base is an important point."
"The Commission has founded its proposal on Article 95 because it strongly believes that this measure ought to be adopted under the codecision procedure."
"However, as Mrs Kauppi predicted, the Council has changed the legal base to Articles 93 and 94."
"That is very regrettable."
"It is not the first occasion that the Council has acted in this way."
"It did so in relation to Directive 2001/44/EC, dealing with mutual assistance on the recovery of tax claims."
"The Commission and Parliament have challenged this before the Court of Justice, as they have done in other similar cases."
"The Advocate-General's opinion, however, supported the Council."
"The Commission nonetheless maintains its stand on the principle, although we shall have to look at the Court's final ruling on the tax recovery case to guide us in our concrete actions on the proposal we are debating today."
"Now, I turn to the equally important Purvis report."
"The development of offshore funds – in particular but not only hedge funds – is a real concern because of the total lack of information for European markets and financial authorities."
"So we share the concern expressed by Mr Purvis and other Members of Parliament."
"We have to find a way to tackle that issue."
"As Mr Purvis said, in the short term it would be appropriate to find incentives to attract offshore funds onshore."
"But it remains to be seen whether that is necessary in the longer term."
"I am particularly unhappy that these enormous offshore funds escape our supervision and control."
"While on the one hand it is important to have a liquid financial market so that the cost of money is not higher than it needs to be, on the other hand we should not allow this situation to continue unchecked for much longer."
"Having said that, the manner in which we tackle that problem is not all that obvious."
"If Members – Mr Goebbels, Mr Purvis or others – have ideas on how to regulate these offshore funds, then I would be very happy to receive them and return to Parliament at a later stage to discuss them."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon."
"Mr President. The oral amendment aims to replace the first word in paragraph 1 – 'Welcomes' – with the word 'Notes', also adding the following from the end of Amendment No 11: 'believes that the fight against illegal immigration and trafficking in people must not give rise to a repressive policy aimed at immigrants in regular circumstances, but should, rather, target traffickers and employers who exploit those circumstances'."
". Mr President, on paragraph 3 I have agreed a compromise amendment with the PSE and ELDR Groups, as well as my own Group, to add the following after the words 'the retail investor': 'when the different regulatory authorities at European level recommend it is appropriate'."
". With regard to paragraph 27, I agree with the Socialist and Liberal Groups that we should replace the words 'high capital' with 'appropriate capital' and take out the last few words: 'as has happened during the various crises, including in the case of the LTCM crisis.'"
"(1)"
". We are in favour of abolishing value added tax because it is a tax that is particularly unfair and we are in favour of it being replaced with a highly progressive tax on income and by a high tax on profits."
"Whilst being against taxation, we do not want to prevent the extension of reduced rates of VAT for some sectors even though the choice of sectors benefiting from this measure is arbitrary and restrictive."
"We voted in favour of this report for this single reason, but this vote does not in any way imply support for the indirect tax system in general, or for VAT in particular."
". On 23 July 2003, the Commission published a proposal on the reform of the system of reduced rates of VAT, with the aim of streamlining the system, as part of a move towards a definitive regime that would discontinue the experiment of applying reduced VAT to certain labour intensive services (Directive 1999/85)."
"This proposal was rejected by Parliament in December 2003 and the Council failed to reach a unanimous decision on the proposal. The Commission has therefore been obliged to table a proposal to extend the current experiment for a further two years until the end of 2005, and this deserves our support."
"We can thereby ensure tax flexibility for Member States, who must retain freedom of choice when it comes to implementing the social and cultural policies that cover the possibility of applying reduced VAT to certain sectors."
"Within the context of the internal market, tax harmonisation is indeed a bad idea, with repercussions for the ways in which Member States finance their budgets. This is especially true of a country such as Portugal where, in 1998, 22% of State revenue came from VAT and reduced rates of VAT accounted for 37% of VAT-generated revenue in the sectors concerned."
"It is important now, at the end of the legislative period, to carry out an evaluation of the directive before us."
". I approved Parliament’s draft legislative resolution seeking to extend the facility allowing Member States to apply reduced rates of VAT for certain labour-intensive services, in particular the building industry."
"This text is far from satisfactory."
"It is merely a stopgap compared with the opinion given by Parliament on 4 December 2003, which called for the application of reduced taxes to be made permanent and to extend it to the catering industry and to cultural products."
"It will at least, though, allow the Member States concerned to extend a trial that demonstrated positive effects on employment and the strength of SMEs and the self-employed targeted by these measures."
"Despite national studies, the Commission is not convinced by the first three years of trials."
"This extension should be able to convince them."
"Nevertheless, we cannot be content with closing the legal gaps on an ad-hoc basis."
"I hope that the Council will be aware of the impact that these measures have on the economy and on land-use planning and adopt the directive amended by Parliament on 4 December 2003 and give Member States the choice to apply reduced rates of VAT to the catering industry."
". I welcome this report calling for the Commission to approve the reform of the system of reduced rates of VAT, more specifically with regard to the experimental application of reduced rates of VAT to certain labour-intensive services."
"The Commission has modified its proposal, in line with amendments put forward by Parliament on 4 December 2003."
"Parliament stated at the time that the experimental application of reduced rates, originally three years, would need to be extended for a further two years."
"Member States currently applying a reduced rate of VAT will thus be able to carry out a thorough evaluation of the scheme, and will be able to avoid significant price increases in the services concerned."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s view that this directive will benefit users and producers of labour-intensive services in Europe."
"I voted in favour."
". I welcome this report on the Commission’s proposal to amend Directive 77/799/EEC, which, as highlighted in the report, does not raise any substantive concerns and requests that the Commission’s proposal be approved as proposed."
"The aim of the Commission’s proposal is to simplify processes and to iron out certain anomalies in the 1977 text."
"The main innovation is that two or more Member States may undertake joint controls where a taxable person is active in more than one Member State, thereby preventing tax evaders from hiding in another Member State."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she states that in all likelihood the Council will change the legal basis on this matter anyway, and that there is no reason to re-evaluate Parliament’s position. In the context of the two Commission proposals concerning 77/799/EEC, Council consulted Parliament on the change of legal basis."
"Parliament has shown that this type of administrative cooperation does not affect material tax law, but rather seeks to ensure that the single market works well. There is therefore no justification for the Council to change the legal basis."
"I voted in favour."
". The services sector is particularly important to big business in the ΕU, in that industrial activities are increasingly moving to other areas of the world."
"Mrs Kratsa's report moves along lines required by the imposition of the terms of big business on this sector and its content reveals the manner in which the neo-liberal policy of the EU deals with the problems."
"Interest focuses on increasing competitiveness, on harmonising the services sector with competition policy and on the cross-border provision of services, while entrepreneurship is deified as the solution to all the problems of unemployment and underemployment."
"The so-called 'open coordination method' for national policies is also promoted, which is nothing more than a mechanism for imposing EU policy without the apparent involvement of its institutions."
"In addition, the report praises the new forms of work, part-time and temporary employment, but talks hypocritically about enhancing their quality."
"It adopts the raising of the retirement age and calls for note to be taken of the 'beneficial' consequences of privatising services of general interest."
"Needless to say, the standard formulae about improving the positions of women and the disabled and using new technologies have not been left out."
"For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
". This report, which addresses the issue of job creation in the services sector, contains some positive elements, such as recognising the valuable contribution which a highly developed and dynamic cooperative services sector may make to service production, and calling for the promotion of policies to support specific service sectors, emphasising the advantages of such policies and taking into account the needs of the various regions."
"It also, however, delves into the complexities of the Competitiveness Council, which it calls upon to give much higher priority to the creation of an internal market for services, without distinguishing between public services and other services."
"The report does make some important points, criticising working conditions in certain areas, low salaries, poor levels of qualification, discrimination, particularly against women, and pressure on public services, due to budget cuts in the social sector."
"Yet it does not offer any coherent proposals on how to remedy these problems. The position the report adopts shifts continually and does not state clearly how it will effectively guarantee job creation and workers’ rights in the various service areas, nor does it take a firm stance in defence of high-quality public services."
"I therefore abstained in the final vote."
". I voted in favour, as I welcome the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs initiative and Mrs Kratsa’s report."
"The importance of the service sector as a key element in job creation can be amply illustrated in simple statistics."
"In 2000, services accounted for 68.8% of overall employment in the EU, whereas in 1991, this figure was as low as 62.7%."
"These figures are all the more revealing when compared with the US, where the service sector accounts for 80% of economic activity and 80% of the work force."
"The service sector acts as a catalyst for future growth, and the opportunities that it offers should be exploited to the full."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she calls on the Commission to publish a White Paper on the completion of an effective and genuine internal services market as quickly as possible, in which emphasis is placed on public or private investment in research and development and which demonstrates considerable commitment to SMEs as a driving force."
"I particularly welcome the idea that the most important investment nowadays is in people, in men and women, given that education and training – alongside the dissemination of new technologies – are the main ingredients of effective policy for innovation in the services sector and for the worthwhile aim of job creation."
"Mr President, we have voted against the report on immigration, integration and employment by Mr Moraes, despite the fact that it is an excellent piece of work."
"This is due to the intransigence of certain Members from the Parliamentary Socialist Group who I believe are less concerned about the living and working conditions of immigrants than about making political capital and taking advantage of them for party political reasons."
"The competent committee, Employment and Social Affairs, given the content of the Communication, ‘immigration, integration and employment’, believed it was not the time to treat the possible right to vote in local or European elections as a key issue, despite the fact that the latter is regulated in the Treaty."
"Furthermore, this issue is regulated in each Member State."
"In Spain, in Article 13(2) of the Constitution, and the reciprocity principle laid down in the friendship and cooperation treaties with Chile, Venezuela, Argentina and Uruguay."
"Also unacceptable is the automatic regularization proposed by the European United Left, in its Amendment No 13, for all those who lack residency authorisation."
"This would be equivalent, Mr President, to inviting illegal immigration, and, within a short space of time, to creating, in the receiving States, a situation just like the one the immigrants arriving in Europe are trying to escape from."
"If only we could receive everybody who wanted to come."
"Since this is not possible, we must receive as many people as we can in the spirit of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: ‘Human dignity is inviolable."
"It must be respected and protected’."
"The Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would have liked to have voted in favour of the Moraes report, because we are concerned about the living and working conditions of immigrants in the European Union: their salary, their occupational health, their work."
"Because we want their integration and that of their families and children, because we are concerned about the situation of immigrant women, because we are in favour of intercultural coexistence in communities, cities and work places."
"It is a shame that the intransigence of certain members of the Parliamentary Socialist Group and the desire to make party political capital have prevented the excellent report by Mr Moraes from receiving the vote its quality merited."
"We have voted in favour of this report because its content is sound."
"We do not, however, accept the content of one of the amendments to the report."
"This calls upon the Member States automatically to legalise the position of immigrants working without residence permits."
"We view this as a direct challenge to people outside the EU to try to emigrate illegally to the EU, and we also perceive the risks of social dumping that such a situation would entail."
"We believe that the EU should have a common asylum and immigration policy."
"We regret that the report makes no distinction between those areas of immigration to be handled at European level and those to be handled at national level."
"We also believe that the concept of civic citizenship does not add anything of value but, rather, contributes to conceptual confusion."
"It is unacceptable for the concept to be given the significance it is accorded by the report because it means that individual countries’ right to determine their electoral laws themselves is not respected."
"Every nation is entitled to decide for itself which third-country citizens will get to take part in that nation’s elections, irrespective of whether they are local or European elections."
". I voted against the Moraes report, which reiteratesthe unrealistic guidelines contained in the Commission Communication on immigration, integration and employment."
"The whole of this document is skewed in favour of more extensive immigration – a source of cultural and social enrichment – which would contribute to the entrepreneurial spirit, to diversity and innovation, and with a positive economic impact on employment and growth (page 10)."
"If everything is going so well, then we wonder why the rapporteur, like the Commission, is concerned about the ‘second and third generation immigrants still facing social, economic or political exclusion’ (Recital E), and why it is necessary to take so many voluntary integration measures (many of which will only increase the number of immigrants)."
"The truth is that the level of immigration that we are accepting does not correspond to the needs of our economy and our society’s reception capacity."
"Integrating immigrants means huge costs – which no one, and above all the Commission, in its Communication – dares mention to the citizens."
"In any case, no one is ready to shoulder these costs, so much so that, as a result of lies and a lack of awareness, immigration is drifting towards becoming an out-and-out social disaster, for us and for the countries of origin."
". In this report there are some good proposals for resolving the crucial problems of the Member States and of the third-country nationals who want to live and work in Europe."
"However, this proposal for a resolution contains exaggerations and irregularities."
"I feel that legal immigrants can make a valuable contribution to the labour market, but the labour market situation in Member States, who are responsible for deciding on the immigration of third-country nationals as workers, needs to be taken into account."
"When, at the beginning of the 90s, we granted the right to vote in local and European elections to citizens of Member States, providing that they are residing in the country concerned, this practice was based on reciprocity: a Portuguese person can vote in Luxembourg and I can vote in Portugal in the same conditions."
"To ask for exactly the same treatment for third-country nationals boils down to ignoring this reciprocity."
"Why should an Algerian be able to vote here when I could not vote in Algeria in the same conditions?"
"Subsidiarity must apply."
"Laying guilt on those Member States that do not grant such rights to immigrants from these countries goes too far because, implicitly, they are being treated as racist."
". The VVD delegation, which attaches importance to European action in the areas of immigration and employment opportunities, will be voting in favour of the Moraes Report."
"It will not, however, be voting in favour of all the amendments that have been tabled, some of which violate the subsidiarity principle, one example of this being European interference in local elections."
". Let us not be under any illusions: in tandem with a new pro-active attitude in family policy, the management of migration flows is one response to the problem of an ageing population and a reduced EU workforce."
"As the Commission concluded, the management of migration flows is essential if we are to avoid a drop-off in economic growth and a reduction in our quality of life."
"It is therefore valuable that the Commission was able to pinpoint the areas where coordinated European action can be of benefit, without overlooking different national realities and sensitivities – integration into the labour market, recognition of migrants’ qualifications, linguistic and educational abilities, housing and urban issues, health and social services and social and cultural integration."
"I also welcome the inclusion of the concept of ‘civic citizenship’, enabling legal immigrants to enjoy a status that confers on them a sense of belonging."
"Integration is an essential factor in social cohesion that depends on factors such as education, language and civic participation."
"Lastly, I welcome the statement that ‘migration cannot be viewed purely in terms of economic potential’, which suggests a policy of profound human sensitivity that is also in tune with social reality."
"As Portugal’s People’s Party (CDS/PP) advocates, ‘strictness on entry, generosity and humanity in reception and integration’."
". The texts debated refer to the few immigrants who will manage to get past the controls of border guards and electronic records with new biometric data; not immigrants arriving on European charter flights so that they can queue up to become 'legal' immigrants."
"Even for these immigrants, the conditions for acquiring a resident's permit, in Greece at least, are prohibitive."
"In other words, people who have been in Greece for 10, 20 or 30 years will still be illegal."
"The ruling class wants them to be illegal so that they can hold them to physical and psychological ransom."
"The texts cynically admit that immigrants are useful as a way of dealing with the demographic problem of the ΕU, of meeting the needs for mainly unskilled labour and of implementing the Lisbon objectives."
"The resolution warns that 'managed migration cannot mean side-stepping the reforms of ΕU labour markets ... needed to increase employability and overall adaptability to economic change'."
"The objective is to overexploit immigrants, so that flexible forms of employment and the depression of labour costs for the benefit of the unifying monopolies can pass more easily into the working order of the EU and the repressive measures are more easily accepted by the peoples, in the name of fighting illegal immigration."
"For these reasons, the Communist Party of Greece did not back the resolution."
". This report addresses the sensitive question of immigration, integration and employment."
"The text raises important issues, such as migratory flows, improving the integration of immigrants and the need for cooperation with countries of origin."
"These are crucial issues for the employment markets and for economic growth in all the Member States."
"This report might have won our vote, were it not for the adoption of a large number of amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which added little to the substance of the report and turned it into a left-wing document and not a compromise acceptable to the whole of Parliament."
"I therefore voted against."
".– The integration of immigrants, be they economic migrants or refugees in search of asylum, is a major challenge for our societies."
"Indeed, the success of our immigration policies will depend on the success of our integration policies."
"We must frame a contract of values between our societies and the ethnic communities that they take in."
"This is an issue that affects all of us."
"We must welcome immigrants and respect the diversity of their cultures, religions and traditions."
"At the same time, immigrants themselves must accept our traditional values as set out in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights: respect for democracy, freedom, human rights, equality between men and women, and religious freedom."
"These values must under no circumstances be called into question."
"The watchword is ‘diversity in unity’."
"In the interest of strengthening integration policies, discussion should take place regarding the concept of civic citizenship that could be developed for nationals from third countries."
"This would include a set of rights and responsibilities, such as equality of social, economic and political treatment, in areas such as working conditions and voting rights in local and European elections."
"The Moderate delegation believes that an EU without internal borders requires efficient and coordinated administration of the EU’s external borders with a view, for example, to combating illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings and drugs and other crime, as well as with a view to handling migration flows."
"Those Member States that require assistance in monitoring their borders must be able to obtain this following application by the responsible authorities of said Member States."
"The national authorities must remain responsible for administering and controlling the Member States’ borders in the EU."
"For the above reasons, we have chosen to abstain from voting."
"Otherwise, we support the content of the report."
".– The Pirker Report considers the Commission communication on illegal immigration, which rightly seeks to combine various documents on a number of different issues, such as, among others, the fight against illegal immigration, the smuggling and trafficking of human beings, control of external borders, and policy on return of illegal residents."
"This is long overdue."
"A large number of the proposals tabled in this regard should be approved."
"Of particular importance is the proposal to set up the Visa Information System (VIS), aimed at combating fraud, especially using biometric identifiers."
"This, again, is long overdue."
"Such information ought to be extended to make it possible to ascertain that visitors to the country have indeed left once their visa has expired."
"Similarly, it puts forward excellent measures with the aim of establishing cooperation to support countries whose borders at the greatest risk."
"The report is adversely affected, however, by the Commission’s reluctance to put in place an integrated system of external border control, for which the Draft Constitution (Article III-166) aims to provide a legal basis."
"It should be reiterated that, while Member States must help each other, each State must retain absolute control of its borders."
". Although the report contains positive and necessary elements, it falls short in a number of fundamental areas."
"For example, it has nothing to say about the need for Member States to actively implement a policy of tracking down illegal immigrants."
"The effect of the policy of toleration and the naturalizations (whether or not collective) in several Member States is to attract more foreigners to live there illegally."
"It is all very well to circulate information in the countries of origin in order to deter potential illegal immigrants, but, if a country’s policies remain lax (tolerating, for example, illegal immigrants’ occupation of churches to attract media attention), it is a waste of time and effort."
"Most illegal immigrants are not ‘victims of the trade in human beings’; they have come to Europe of their own volition, in the knowledge that, in a number of Member States, they can enjoy certain social-security and other benefits – despite being there illegally."
"It follows that they are not the ‘persons in danger’ that they are described as being; it is also illusory to believe that opening up the borders to new legal immigration in a limited number of sectors of the labour market will deter illegal immigrants."
"The attraction thus created will always be greater than envisaged, and so we will end up with just as many illegal immigrants on our hands."
". This report contains major contradictions, with some positive, but a number of very negative aspects."
"The report says, for example, that victims of human trafficking must not be treated as criminals, but as victims of crime, and this is to be welcomed. Yet it endorses the Council’s decision that Member States should announce legal immigration quotas, which could be used to establish, at EU level, a joint position in negotiations on readmission agreements."
"The report rejects the idea of creating an agency to deal specifically with border control, but reiterates its support for creating a European Corps of Border Guards, comprising special units and receiving EU funding. It points out, however, that the Corps could be temporarily detached, if necessary, at the request of Member States, to help national authorities monitor at-risk sections of the EU’s external borders."
"We are opposed to the creation of a European Corps with Member States’ competences. What we advocate is more effective national policy and proper cooperation between Member States."
"Regrettably, certain proposals that we tabled were not approved, in particular the proposal to reject any system of immigration quotas as a response to the needs of European companies, which would be tantamount to plundering the productive strengths of third countries."
"This explains our vote."
". I voted in favour of this report as I believe that organised crime, illegal immigration, smuggling and the trafficking of human beings are a constant threat to the EU’s internal security and require reinforced security at external borders."
"Although this is a fundamentally national matter, which should remain a national competence, there is a pressing need for uniformly high security standards at all of the EU’s external borders. This would entail responsibility sharing with the task of securing sections of these borders that are particularly at risk and general improvements in the effectiveness of measures by means of joint action."
"Certain tasks should be performed at EU level, in order to support, complement or coordinate the work of national authorities."
"I agree with the rapporteur with regard to operational cooperation and exchange of information about illegal immigration. I also welcome the Commission’s proposal regarding the creation of a European Corps of Border Guards, comprising special units and financed by the Community, which, if necessary, and at the request of Member States, could be temporarily detached to help the national authorities monitor at-risk sections of the EU’s external borders, without, however, usurping Member States’ competences."
"I have voted against paragraph four, which was adopted by 277 votes in favour, with 129 votes against and 47 abstentions."
"The paragraph supports the development of a European Corps of Border Guards, made up of special units, which would be financed by the Community."
"If necessary, and at the request of the Member States, it would temporarily help the national authorities secure certain at-risk sections of the external borders, without, however, usurping Member States’ competences."
"I do not believe that the EU should set up a further military authority, but that, in the future too, responsibility should lie with the respective Member States."
"Better coordination between the Member States, together with the acceptance of greater responsibility on the part of their governments, may be a better method."
".– Having been deaf and dumb for years – and not for lack of warnings – Parliament and the Commission have woken up."
"The Schengen agreements reducing interior border controls within Europe would appear to have had some perverse effects: increased illegal immigration, illegal employment, crime and all manner of trafficking."
"The only problem was that instead of dealing with the main cause of all of these problems, these scandalous Schengen agreements, our leaders are attacking their effects!"
"This report thus proposes as a magic solution a common policy on immigration, on visas and border controls, in particular creating a ‘European Corps of Border Guards’, and thereby reducing Member States’ sovereignty over their territory."
"In order to combat illegal immigration, the report envisages implementing an ‘active policy on legal immigration""."
"What hypocrisy!"
"One might sum this up as meaning that, if there are too many illegal immigrants, we arrange for them all to be legalised."
"The French Government is indeed adept as this type of sleight of hand."
"In truth, the entire text is utterly insignificant, since, let us not forget, the tone on illegal immigration was set at the June 2002 summit in Seville."
"The decision was effectively taken, notably under French pressure from President Chirac, not to take any enforcement measures against the countries of origin of illegal immigrants."
"The aim of this Directive, which dates back to 1996, is to eliminate obstacles and uncertainties concerning the posting of workers, within the framework of the provision of services, by improving legal certainty and making it possible to identify working conditions that apply to workers temporarily working in a Member State other than the State whose legislation governs the employment relationship."
"The Commission feels that while the implementation of the Directive has been satisfactory, some States have yet to transpose it in full and some companies still argue that difficulties continue to arise in its application. Consequently, workers continue to suffer discrimination."
"A group of experts has been set up by the Commission, made up of officials from the Member States, with the aim of finding solutions to problems that have arisen."
"Proposals must now be put forward to implement methods of monitoring non-compliance, along with monitoring systems and measures to combat corruption in Member States."
"A European public register must be created at company level, containing information on companies that have been fined or subject to other financial penalties within the framework of this Directive. The principle of mutual recognition must also be applied to financial sanctions in place, with the aim of making these easier to enforce across national borders."
"These are amendments that we endorse and we are extremely disappointed that they were not adopted."
"This explains our abstention in the final vote."
". The mobility of workers has, in certain Member States in particular, led to discrimination and often abuse."
"We must be constantly vigilant on issues such as the minimum wage, paid holidays, subcontracting arrangements and social protection for workers in EU territory."
"Within this context, Mrs Glase’s report focuses on reviewing the ways in which the Directive is applied, concerning the posting of workers to other EU Member States within the framework of the provision of services. Given that the Directive has not long been implemented, it is impossible at this stage to make a global and detailed evaluation of the situation, either quantitatively or qualitatively."
"I also welcome the establishment by the Commission of a group of experts charged with finding solutions to some of the difficulties that have arisen thus far, particularly in relation to information, monitoring compliance with Member States’ legislation in terms of transposition and implementing sanctions."
"Like the rapporteur, I am in favour of continued vigilance and would call for specific proposals to be tabled, to combat effectively the problem of illegal work and other offences."
". Hedge funds and derivatives are good examples of how finance has become the focus of today’s economy, in which financial flows take precedence over the real economy."
"Their main purpose is financial speculation and, in contrast to their supposed aim of risk limitation, they actually increase systemic risks in the financial system because the high volumes of finance (it is estimated that hedge funds alone total around USD 500 billion!) increase the volatility of the capitals markets."
"Hedge funds were behind the crisis that beset Europe’s financial system in 1992 and behind the Asian crisis of 1997-1998."
"Recent IMF studies have demonstrated the impact that financial crises have on reducing world production."
"Many of these funds are located in tax havens, which may also lead to money-laundering."
"This report, which we must reject, is structured around promoting the action plan for financial services and seeks to stimulate and support these instruments, referring to hedge funds as ‘sophisticated alternative investment vehicles’."
"This support entails reducing excessive regulation, thereby increasing the degree to which the regulatory framework for these funds is liberalised, when what is really needed is exactly the opposite, namely the imposition of a tax on capital movements, which would not only generate income for other activities, but would also help to combat purely speculative movements and to monitor these instruments more effectively."
". I can understand the rapporteur’s position on the advantage of there being, albeit in a rather limited form, a regulated regime in the field of ‘hedge funds’ – an expression that covers a broad range of financial products that could be called sophisticated alternative investment vehicles’ (SAIVs)."
"The funds to be regulated by this system would be thus defined, since they would be obliged to comply with these particular provisions."
"In fact, the market for these funds is currently fragmented due to varying regulatory regimes, the lack of consistent platforms and discriminatory tax regimes."
"As the rapporteur states, tax regimes and the lack of a single regulatory market act as a deterrent, with many Member States imposing tax penalties on investors who invest in a foreign domiciled hedge fund."
"It must be said that institutional and private investors are showing increasing interest, but lack suitable vehicles in EU jurisdictions."
"Various Member States are now also aiming to apply far-reaching legislative changes to hedge funds."
"I voted in favour because I believe that hedge funds and derivatives contribute to the efficiency and self-balancing of financial markets and it might be useful to establish a light-touch regulatory regime in a free-flowing global market with basic rules ..."
". I voted in favour of the motion on humanitarian aid to Iran following the recent earthquake in Bam."
"The European Parliament has acknowledged that, in light of this humanitarian disaster, swift and effective aid is important for the disaster victims."
"It should be noted that Portugal was one of the first countries to send search and rescue teams to the area, which have done admirable work there."
"I also voted in favour because I agree that we should choose the humanitarian option despite the prevailing political conditions in Iran, which are denying democratic freedoms and are preventing international experts from monitoring military programmes to develop nuclear energy."
"Nevertheless, the political message sent out by the European Parliament was clear: the Iranian authorities will, in future, have to match this goodwill gesture, which had no conditions attached, by re-establishing minimum conditions for the democratic functioning of the State, and by allowing the necessary international inspections of its nuclear programme to take place."
". The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution, not of course because we are against aid to Iran, but because the text combines it in an undisguised and vulgar manner with political coercion."
"The imperialists of the ΕU hold nothing sacred; they have no compassion in the face of human suffering and misfortune."
"However well we know this, we cannot but get angry when we read texts like today’s, especially when signed by all the political groups."
"In return for the EUR 2.3 million which the ΕU is giving (crumbs compared with the 31.3 million dollars needed for the first three months), it is asking for everything from Iran: implementation of the additional protocol to the NPT, a dialogue on respect for human rights, faster reforms etc."
"Nor does the resolution fail to advertise the 'generosity' of the American President."
"We are the last to support the Iranian regime."
"However, solidarity should be in the direction which the people of Iran want and not in the direction the imperialists want."
"– Mr President, unfortunately, the other night, while walking around in the dark at home, I fractured the little toe of my left foot and, for the life of me, I no longer had it in me to give the explanation of vote."
"I am very concerned."
"Can my explanation of vote be given by my feet?"
"– I think we will leave it there and wish you a speedy recovery."
"So it would seem that it was your little toe that stopped us from hearing your lovely voice."
"Explanations of vote are closed."
"(2)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0478/2003) by Mrs Mercedes Echerer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a Community framework for collective management societies in the field of copyright and associated rights (2002/2274(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has already adopted a number of directives in the field of copyright."
"That was good, correct and important."
"In my opinion, the harmonisation process here has perhaps failed to press on further with necessary reforms, because digitalisation as well as enlargement are challenges that the policy must face up to."
"So far, so good."
"Copyright rests on at least three pillars, but also on the enforcement and protection of rights."
"These two areas must accompany copyright."
"They can neither make up for lost ground nor correct errors."
"We still have to wait for the enforcement directive."
"It is being discussed very actively in the Parliament at present, and has also been discussed in a trialogue."
"Up until now the Commission has shown no clear intention to undertake such activities in rights protection."
"We were given a promise just under two years ago."
"We waited for that promise for a long time. Then Parliament decided to take action and not to wait for that promise to be kept."
"In the meantime, there is a communication, which apparently will be forwarded to us in the next few weeks."
"Thank you in advance."
"During the Christmas holidays, I read in the German press that the Commission is even planning a directive in this area."
"Good. It is taking a long time, but perhaps it will now be a good directive."
"Now I would like first and foremost to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, who have supported my initiative from the outset; we have debated it in great detail for a very long time, and now I would like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsmen of the two opinions."
"They have not only been helpful, but they have greatly enriched the whole project."
"As I said, it was a long process."
"We have talked to the most diverse of networks."
"We have been open to the needs, problems, questions and suggestions of all involved and discussed them in depth."
"All involved also means the single market, competition and information society sectors, because copyright is an essential instrument for creators and for right-holders – that was beyond question from the start."
"I would like to summarise quite briefly here the most important things this report says."
"We on the Committee on Legal Affairs were of the opinion that there was a need for suitable measures, as I said at the start, not only because of enlargement but actually in order to create a single European market for products protected by copyright and also by related rights."
"We were also agreed that in so doing we had to remain true to the principles of copyright."
"I would like to mention here just three essential factors, proper and fair participation in the value chain, that every use should be properly rewarded in accordance with the law applicable and, last but not least, the territoriality principle of copyright."
"We call on the Directorate-General for Competition to continue to tackle the vertical concentration of the media and of production within the media and to do so with renewed vigour, just like it did at the start of this legislative period."
"We also ask the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition to concern itself with the distribution channels, especially in the media, and with the dominant position of individual branches of industry in this area and to investigate cases of abuse, but not to throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"Moreover, digitalrightsmanagement – we are all familiar with the abbreviation DRM – is a very good and important step in the right direction."
"We will all be making greater use of this DRM, but it will not be as successful as we want without interoperability."
"And we must be aware that DRM will not of course be the answer to every problem."
"As far as the collecting societies themselves are concerned, we are calling for comparable and compatible statutes and practices."
"If they have not already done so, we want them to stipulate that their function is that of a trustee."
"We also propose that their activities be legitimised by democratic structures and above all also by an equitable and balanced relationship between the right-holders’ groups involved within a collecting society."
"We also find that where collecting societies have control mechanisms they are not always compatible across borders and some of them are not very efficient."
"There are examples at both extremes, both positive and negative."
"We therefore call for independent, efficient, transparent and expert control mechanisms incorporating all aspects, legal, social, cultural and economic aspects, greater transparency not only to promote competition, of course, but also to benefit all right-holders, all user groups and all consumers, and a duty, not only on collecting societies but also on users, to provide information."
"We want uniform coding standards in order to better control the circulation of works, and interoperability must be assured here too."
"The collecting societies themselves have made many proposals for reforms, some of which are really superb."
"I shall be asking the Commission to include this advice, these reform proposals, in its discussion process now that it is preparing a directive, while always safeguarding the principle or principles of copyright."
"Last but not least, I would like to say that it is important for all of us to bring about easier access for users, for commercial users and consumers, but always safeguarding the copyright principle."
"This is a fact-finding paper by the European Parliament, and I think that if, when it comes to the vote today, it is adopted with a similar passion and support as it was in Committee, then this Parliament will have a foundational document on which both it and the next Parliament can build."
"Sincere thanks once again to all who have helped."
"It only remains for me to tell you now that when the vote itself comes I shall be bringing an oral amendment which will be concerned only with the language versions."
"Otherwise, since no amendments have been tabled I can only assume that this afternoon will see this report overwhelmingly approved."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Echerer, for taking the initiative to deal with this important subject."
"The resolution submitted to Parliament today is very timely and tackles a key issue in the area of copyright and related rights."
"Rights management refers to the way in which copyright and related rights are administered – in other words, the way in which they are marketed."
"Collective rights management is generally handled by collecting societies, which act as trustees and usually enjoy an exclusive position in their respective markets."
"Although the Community legislative authority has largely harmonised copyright and related rights and a draft directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights is currently in hand under the codecision procedure, rights management has only been dealt with marginally by the Community legislative authority."
"The economic contribution made by copyright-based goods and services to the Community's gross domestic product is very significant."
"As a recent study shows, such goods and services represent more than 5% of total European GDP."
"Consequently, the internal market cannot be complete unless the management of copyright and related rights is addressed."
"That is essential for investment, creativity, access to culture, cultural diversity, employment and growth."
"On the specific issue of collective rights management, the draft resolution is well balanced and reflects all the issues and different interests involved. I congratulate Mrs Echerer on that."
"The unanimous support which her proposal received in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market demonstrates that."
"The resolution points out that the protection and collective management of intellectual property rights are important factors in stimulating cultural diversity and creativity, but recognises the important role of collecting societies as an interface between rightholders and users and therefore calls for such societies to be more efficient and more transparent."
"It takes account of the characteristic features of copyright, notably its territorial nature, and the new environment for management of rights, such as the emergence of digital rights management."
"Lastly, the resolution notes that national laws on collective rights management, where they exist, often differ greatly from one Member State to another."
"The Commission shares the approach followed by this resolution."
"The issues raised, in so far as they relate to copyright, are also dealt with in the forthcoming Commission communication on the management of copyright and related rights in the internal market."
"In that communication, the Commission will address all issues relevant to rights management, including collective rights management, and conclude that a legislative instrument of good governance of collective societies is desirable at Community level."
"I hope that the Commission will adopt the communication this month, and I am pleased that our two institutions share the same concerns."
"I assure you that over the next few months the Commission will provide the necessary follow-up to this analysis and to requests in this field."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Echerer most sincerely for the good teamwork and the expertise that characterises it."
"This report is the latest reason why I will not be the only one to be sorry that you, Mrs Echerer, will not be standing for this Parliament again."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted my opinion unanimously and because of the good teamwork is also able to vote in favour of the Echerer report."
"In drafting this opinion for the forthcoming debate, including that with the Commission, I and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs were concerned primarily with five particular points. Firstly, monopolies must always be exceptions to competition law and there must be sound reasons for them."
"We know that collecting societies are organised differently in the various Member States and in many they have a monopoly over particular categories of works."
"There is therefore a definite need to look more closely at, or review, the territorial monopoly structures, but not to reject them outright."
"Secondly, it is in our opinion important to have transparency in collecting societies, such as showing administrative and licence costs separately in the accounts."
"Something needs to be done here."
"Thirdly – and this is related to the second point – there is in many countries no supervision of collecting societies."
"I therefore expressly welcome paragraph 49 of the Echerer Report with its call for efficient independent control mechanisms in all Member States."
"Fourthly, my suggestion for a public register that could be accessed electronically, containing all right-holders represented by collecting societies, would make for greater clarity and improved transparency and would certainly also simplify cross-border activity and increase competition."
"Fifthly and finally, where the fragmentation of rights gives rise to high transaction costs, the introduction of a one-stop shop system could be a more efficient and cheaper way for users and exploiters of rights."
"I ask the Commission to take the contents of the Echerer report on board in its deliberations."
"Once again my sincere congratulations and I ask you to vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, this afternoon I am speaking not only on my own behalf, as I have worked closely with the rapporteur, Mrs Echerer, but also more particularly on behalf of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, who is sorry that she is unable to be here to share in these comments."
"On her behalf, I want to begin by thanking Mrs Echerer on a number of scores."
"Firstly, I want to thank her for quite rightly bringing this matter to the attention of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and then taking the initiative to draw up the report."
"This is very much to her credit, and in this matter she has been very keen to share her insight and concerns with us and to invite us to contribute to it."
"That spirit in which she approached the report is clearly shown in the quality of her work and, to echo what the Commissioner said, it is a very well-balanced document."
"It presents all sides very fairly, but it does not shrink from making a number of important and sharply-focused recommendations."
"From what the Commissioner said, I dare to hope that in his communication he will take on board a number of the points Mrs Echerer has made."
"So this is a very timely report."
"It also shows the benefits of having someone with strong expertise and background in a particular profession in this case, in the acting profession, on the stage someone who is a creative artist, who knows the subject, and of being able to combine that with the engagement of other colleagues."
"This question of balance and balance of interest is clearly at the heart of this report."
"The balance between the creators of works the producers and the people who exploit them and use them I prefer to say the customers, because that is what they are in the whole arrangement is absolutely crucial."
"That balance now is in many ways an uncertain one, because we are in such a volatile area of transition at the moment, not only with the explosion of digital content and digital distribution, and new forms of access to customers, but also with new creative works that are available for exploitation in the digital media world."
"For example, I have been doing work recently which has brought me into contact with people who are producing computer games and interactive computer games and the scale of that multibillion dollar, global business is producing enormous new opportunities for creators in every field, whether in illustration, music composition or script production."
"We need to encourage that, but we must make sure that we stimulate the development of those fields and that people are properly rewarded."
"Indeed, as we move into the third generation of mobile technology, one of the major concerns about the providers of electronic communications services and they have said that to us in our capacity as Members of Parliament working in this field is that they want us to help get the framework for content delivery right and to make sure that we get the creative works out into the marketplace because they want those creative works there to stimulate their electronic communication services."
"This is not just an abstract piece of work."
"This is a further fundamental piece of thinking around the internal market."
"It relates directly back to our work on the Lisbon Process and to creating the most dynamic and knowledge-driven economy in the world, using the knowledge we have to link creative works as well."
"One of the issues over which we had quite a lot of debate with Mrs Echerer indeed Mr Karas referred to it, and much of what came from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and indeed from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport was also included in our final vote is the question of the operation of the marketplace in connection with collective rights management."
"I was pleased that Mrs Echerer accepted our view that, in the internal market for services, and this week Commissioner Bolkestein has been here presenting a wide-ranging new proposal for that in that new proposal for the internal market for services, those elements of collecting societies' activities where they are directly providing services to their members need to be treated like any other service provision and looked at in the context of the cross-border market for services."
"That is absolutely right because, as Mr Karas said, increasingly the distribution of rights is no longer going to be centred around national monopolies."
"The customers and I come back to that word increasingly want that 'one-stop shop'."
"They want to be able to go and access rights for created products that will allow them to distribute digitally not just across the European Union, but indeed in other major markets as well."
"That challenge to internationalise the process, to look outside the traditional borders of it, is something that the collective societies as we know are facing up to, but we need to provide them with the right framework and encouragement to do that."
"In conclusion, the key to that will be transparency of their activities so that all their customers can see exactly what package of services they are getting."
"To conclude, I echo what my colleague Mr Karas said, that I also heard with regret this week the news that Mrs Echerer will not be standing again for this Parliament."
"So this may be the last chance I have in plenary to say publicly from our side of the House that I very much enjoyed working with her."
"This report shows the sort of open and progressive contribution that she has made in her willingness to work with us."
"As she moves her activities to another stage, or should I say back to the stage where she started her career, I am sure that all of us will join in wishing her well, thanking her very much for her work, and we can demonstrate our support for that by our unanimous support for the report when we vote later on."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by paying tribute to Mrs Echerer – and I do not need to insist on this, since many Members have done the same – but I would also like to welcome the statements by Commissioner Bolkestein, who acknowledges the importance of collecting societies at the present time."
"Intellectual property has developed as a result of technological advances."
"Until printing there was no real intellectual property."
"We now have a second technological revolution, the ‘Marconi Galaxy’, with all the new information technologies."
"As technology advances, the creator moves further and further away from the consumer."
"Specifically, my colleague, Mr Harbour, talks of the customer, but I prefer to use the word consumer, differentiating between the two classes of client: the final consumer, that is, the long-suffering citizen who has to watch television and radio programmes, and the intermediary, who buys the intellectual property rights, uses them and exploits them."
"This brings us to the situation we are faced with, with a multiplication of forms of media, but which are increasingly lacking in content."
"In other words, we have more and more hours of television, more and more electronic hours, more magazines, more books and more means of production, but they are practically devoid of content."
"And this is the result of a lack of support for the creator."
"In the current information society, creators are not being protected."
"We are creating rubbish-media, which use intellectual property in an entirely thoughtless way, with no sense of responsibility whatsoever and, in view of this, creators need to be protected."
"That is the role of the collecting societies, which are not monopolies, but instruments available to creators so that they can defend themselves in the face of the control of the media by a few media groups, supported by huge economic power and at the service of political or economic interests."
"Therefore, the only instrument these creators have today are these collecting societies, which constitute employees’ unions, in order to confront the employers’ organisations, which have enormous strength."
"I agree that collecting societies must adapt to the new situation, because they have arisen at national level and we are about to move on to a transnational, and even world, level."
"But at least, at European Union level, we should reinforce the action of these collecting societies, so that, at this level, we can have that protection."
"I would like finally to refer to enlargement."
"The European Union is going to be enriched with ten new countries which have a great cultural tradition, but in which – as a result of their recent political past – intellectual property has not been sufficiently protected until very recently."
"I believe it is very important that, in the final enlargement process, we make these countries aware of the need to adapt themselves to the Community acquis, including, amongst other things, collective management, in the face of this danger of monopoly on the part of the large groups controlling the media."
"– Mr President, I join in the warm thanks expressed by all my fellow Members to Mrs Echerer."
"I should also like to do so with reference to the way we cooperated."
"We might yet – who knows? – feature in her TV programmes, as long, of course, as these are properly protected in terms of intellectual property rights."
"That everyone is in agreement is evident from the fact that the report has been adopted unanimously in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"In addition, the encouraging words which the Commissioner has just spoken will now, I think, lead to improved legislation, in respect of which it is particularly important for transparency and legal certainty to be increased and, above all, democratic control, because clarity avoids lack of understanding."
"We are now all talking about the right-holders, but I think that it is also very important to mention the right-users."
"I can remember an incident last year when many companies in the Netherlands received a letter out of the blue from the – the Reproduction Right Foundation – stating that they needed to pay a hefty bill for copies they had made, without any explanation as to the purpose of this exercise."
"This sparked fear and anxiety."
"I think that this legislation can ensure that it becomes clearer on what basis certain costs are charged, why certain costs have to be met and for whom they are intended."
"The Commissioner has already indicated that 5% to 7% of the Gross Domestic Product – which is high – is accounted for by products and services that are limited, governed and protected by copyright and neighbouring rights."
"This means that we are talking about a considerable proportion of our internal market activities, in which there is a need for clarity and structure."
"As I have already pointed out, competition and the dominant position of collecting societies should not be a problem as such, as long as legislation is clear and is not used inappropriately."
"I think that this problem can be solved with these recommendations if they are enshrined in legislation."
"As Mr Medina Ortega has already indicated, enlargement is also a key aspect of this issue."
"As a result of their political history, the acceding countries have never given copyright-holders any explicit protection, and this is why I think it is important to provide support on the spot."
"The rapporteur re-emphasised this point in her oral amendment."
"We, the Liberals, give her our unqualified backing."
"By way of conclusion, we welcome this initiative, and we hope that the Commission can adopt the amendment that I have tabled to produce a clear evaluation after three years in order to check whether the legislation actually works and protection takes place."
"Having kept within the three-minute time limit, I will not further delay this afternoon’s proceedings."
"Mr President, it is customary for a speaker in my role to assure rapporteurs that we are right behind them, but in this case that would not quite be appropriate."
"In this case, the cart is firmly behind the horse, and she is leading us – as well as all the Members of the Committee and Parliament – in the charge."
"We are very grateful to Mrs Echerer for having given us that lead."
"As was said in the debate, there is a kind of tripod involved in relation to copyright and related rights."
"One leg of the tripod is the copyright legislation that has already been adopted by Parliament."
"The second leg is the enforcement provisions that we are currently debating, and the third leg is the issue of collecting societies and the administration of copyright in the interests of rights holders."
"As Commissioner Bolkestein said, these are monopolies, but they are in principle benign monopolies because of the territoriality of copyright."
"It may be – and perhaps Mr Harbour and Mr Karas will explain this to me one day – that collecting societies can operate in competition with each other within a given domain or within a given country, but I find it difficult to see how that would work."
"If I am right, the point made by the Commissioner earlier assumes tremendous importance, namely that we need to look closely and critically at the governance of these societies, which are in a position to 'rip people off' by charging unduly high fees for providing services to artists, authors and others."
"I am delighted to hear that the Commission is to follow up the Committee's initiative by bringing forward a proposal for a legislative instrument concerning the good governance of collecting societies."
"It is a proposal I await eagerly."
"I would like to make a point in response to what Mr Harbour said that also provides me with an opportunity to declare a minor interest."
"I am an academic author and a very modest part of my annual income, as anybody who reads the Declaration of Members' Interests will know, comes from rights management on behalf of myself as an academic author."
"Looking at it from the point of view of an author of that kind, the notion of the reader as customer is not as significant as Mr Harbour said."
"The critical notion – and this also applies to the arts – is surely the reader or consumer as audience."
"One is concerned about getting ideas across to people and getting them engaged in debate about ideas."
"From that point of view, it is a matter of total indifference to an author what or how much they get paid."
"Quite the reverse."
"I and authors like myself have no chance of getting ideas to a wide public unless there are effective publishing systems – that is to say publishers who get paid for their activities."
"In that sense, this whole business of collective rights is for us more a means to an end than an end in itself."
"We should not think of it simply in terms of customers, but as an essential feature of the single market."
"We are delighted with the Commission's proposal and, like everybody else, I am so pleased to have worked with Mrs Echerer on this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapid and multifaceted growth of the information society and the development of ever-more varied communication resources, technologies, instruments and supports that are easily accessible in an enormous variety of ways, place new and continuous pressure on the protection of copyright and related rights, specifically on the laws that cover them and the means for guaranteeing their practical effectiveness, without at the same time violating other fundamental rights and freedoms."
"This issue clearly brings us to the very epicentre of globalisation, to the real uncharted territory of the global village in which, consequently, instruments for regulation and protection must be increasingly international, without prejudice to the responsibility of States themselves."
"One of the novelties imposed, however, by the changes in recent decades, and which has played an increasingly significant role in the last few years, is precisely that of the collective copyright management societies."
"These are undeniable facts of our times and regulating them is, therefore, increasingly important."
"Our group acknowledges their important role as voluntary associations of authors, performers and other copyright holders, in effectively protecting their intellectual and financial interests and their intellectual property or related rights for services at home and abroad."
"We also believe that, in addition to offering protection to creators, artists and others as a group in the context of related rights, by acting as trustees, these collective societies also perform a cultural function of the greatest importance, which is disseminated throughout society at large and throughout an increasingly open and pluralist world."
"On the basis of these principles, we congratulate the rapporteur on her superb work, which clearly identifies the lines that we should pursue if we wish – and we certainly do – to see the framework for rights management in this European Union of ours, which is soon to be enlarged, able to move resolutely towards the crucial aim of simplifying processes and of reforms and comparable parameters."
"We cannot continue with statutes and practices that are too diverse and often even incompatible within the European Union."
"These glaring discrepancies affect us all, leave our creators, artists and other agents in this key area unprotected and make us particularly weak and vulnerable in the face of global competitiveness, which is increasingly aggressive at world level and sometimes even savage and buccaneering, as we know."
"Consequently, we broadly agree with the rapporteur’s ideas on organisational forms of collecting societies, on conditions for authorisation, on areas of activity, on internal structure, on reciprocal agreements, on cultural or social operations and functions in the public interest, on the supervision and control over collecting societies and their activities, on arbitration mechanisms and on transparency, which is a fundamental requirement for all those involved, both internally and externally."
"I wish to say one last thing: to congratulate the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on its work and in particular the suggestions that it presented to the Commission on the future directives on television, radio, communication, transmission and telecommunications in the digital area, opportunely accepted in this report and which feature in paragraph 29 of the resolution that we will be voting in favour of."
"In fact, these directives must also themselves directly enshrine the importance of copyright and its protection, including specific provisions on this matter."
"It is essential that the European Union should enhance art and culture and strengthen the confidence of all creators and other agents and other areas of cultural creation, by cherishing them and encouraging them to create new works that they know will be properly protected against piracy, whilst at the same time guaranteeing their moral rights and reasonable financial rewards."
"We will therefore vote in favour and we join in congratulating the rapporteur."
"– Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega said that collecting societies are not monopolies; they are associations that serve to protect a weaker section against a stronger section."
"That is not always true, and I believe that it should be noted, as the rapporteur notes in her report, that an association is an association, whereas an association with a monopoly, of which one is compelled to be a member by laws governing rights and duties, is a monopoly."
"In my view, monopolies, whether legal or , involving collecting societies, are not healthy because they expose amateur artists, for example, to considerable risk of abuse."
"I am not acquainted with the situation in the rest of Europe; I know that in Italy the sum paid by amateur artists to collecting societies for authors’ rights amounts to a tax which is disproportionate and benefits major artists."
"Consequently, I consider that an association with a monopoly is not a good association, as a good association should be as unfettered as possible."
"Therefore, as the rapporteur states, attention and appropriate controls are required to prevent monopoly situations becoming, whether legally or de facto, as often happens – in Italy certainly, and I believe in the rest of Europe too – abuses and pointless taxes to the detriment of amateur artists."
"In addition to this, if, for example, only associations for the disabled, and not disabled individuals, may avail themselves of the exemption from authors’ rights, there is a risk that authors’ rights will be subject to corporate interests and the final user will not benefit from situations of this kind."
"I, of course, compliment the rapporteur for the work she has carried out."
"– Mr President, the protection and collective management of intellectual property rights are important factors in the promotion of cultural creativity and the aim of making it possible for artists to work."
"Both financial and moral rights must be taken into consideration, the latter meaning authors’ rights to have control over any modification of their works."
"The Community must be able to strengthen artists’ confidence that their works are properly protected."
"On the other hand, it is important to ensure that works are disseminated as widely as possible, because there is no art without an audience."
"The Community has been active in this area, and, besides national and international laws, there are already several Community directives."
"One drawback, however, is still the fact that the rules that apply to societies responsible for the collective management of intellectual property rights vary from one EU Member State to another."
"Often these collective management societies enjoy virtual monopoly status, which might well be justified for functional reasons but at the same time leads to the risk of abuse or defeats its own purpose with a decline in the efficiency of the society or increased costs."
"At any rate a justified monopoly structure does not need to be prevented through legislation, but people should be aware of the associated risks."
"These risks must be countered by means of clear rules to apply throughout the Community."
"Such rules must be based essentially on an insistence on full transparency."
"The necessary statutory changes to Community legislation set out in the report will also have the effect of massively enhancing economic growth."
"The report estimates that between 5% and 7% of EU Gross Domestic Product is earned by goods and services protected by copyright and related rights."
"That is by no means a minor proportion of the European economy and it is surely also still capable of growing."
"Technical advance in particular offers enormous opportunities for the development of new forms of work."
"At the same time the management of copyright in respect of these new kinds of works will be more challenging than ever."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, but above all Mrs Echerer, congratulations on the Sisyphean task that I am sure this report has been."
"That was inevitable with such a many-facetted subject, but its success is a tribute to you."
"We do not always have so large a consensus in this Parliament, and that shows that people have now become more aware of the problems."
"I will illustrate this with a few figures."
"When it comes to child pornography on the Internet, the media are full of headlines and leaders."
"But far less attention is paid to economic crime."
"If artists’ rights are ignored and they are denied the fair income to which they are entitled, that is also an aspect of economic crime."
"An economic loss of 5% of Gross National Product has been mentioned here; broken down into individual areas, it looks like this: 25% of audiovisual industry output is counterfeit, with sound recordings accounting for as much as 40%."
"It has become a lucrative market for organised crime."
"It is not simply a matter of lawbreaking by individuals becoming widespread."
"As is rightly described in detail here, it is also due to excessively lax and at any rate very different laws in the various Member States, which encourage such product piracy and use of counterfeits."
"The result is economic loss on a tremendous scale – lost tax revenue, lost jobs, lost investment confidence, which can be seen in the music industry in particular, but it also means lost rights for people like you and me, namely a loss of consumer protection, a loss of young people’s welfare and the like, and in the end it is also a threat to cultural diversity."
"It follows that a uniform legal basis for the protection of intellectual property is long overdue."
"The collecting societies that have already been mentioned many times have a particular part to play here, especially in light of the changed market conditions that we find in the information society."
"How that can and should be done is described in detail in the report, which also contains the opinions from the other committees."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture, I think it is particularly important to stress that the collecting societies are not simply a kind of protective association, but that they always have a cultural function as well, regardless of how they are organised."
"The protection and exploitation of rights in intellectual property help to promote culture and cultural diversity, so the Committee on Culture is right, in its opinion, to call on the Commission to pay particular attention to this aspect."
". Mr President, after this most interesting debate there is very little that I can add to what I said earlier."
"No questions have been addressed to the Commission and no amendments have been brought to the notice of the Commission – even though Mr Manders mentioned one."
"There is therefore nothing for me to comment on."
"I shall end by saying that in the forthcoming Commission communication on the management of copyright and related rights in the internal market, the Commission will take due cognisance and notice of the remarks made this afternoon by Mr Karas, Mr Harbour and others."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions:"
"- B5-0016/2004 by Glenys Kinnock and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;"
"- B5-0020/2004 by Nelly Maes, Didier Rod and Marie Anne Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"- B5-0022/2004 by Niall Andrews, José Ribeiro e Castro and Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;"
"- B5-0023/2004 by Jan Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political situation in Zimbabwe;"
"- B5-0026/2004 by Pedro Marset Campos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;"
"- B5-0030/2004 by Geoffrey Van Orden, John Alexander Corrie, Nirj Deva, Jacqueline Foster, Neil Parish, Charles Tannock, Mary Elizabeth Banotti, Michael Gahler, Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, Bernd Posselt and Lennart Sacrédeus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"- B5-0033/2004 by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I should like to point out that we will be supporting the joint resolution on Zimbabwe."
"The Zanu-PF regime is an appalling example of the repression of an impoverished and starving people."
"Morgan Tsvangirai – the leader of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change – has been put on trial under spurious charges of treason."
"The economic situation in that country has sharply worsened, with the GDP falling 40% over the last 4 years, and with inflation already at 600% and forecast to reach 1000% before the end of 2004."
"There is 70% unemployment and over 6 million people are in need of food aid."
"There have already been some reports of children dying from malnutrition, particularly in the Bulawayo area."
"There has been a disastrous land reform programme – which no reference to the evils of colonialism can possibly justify – that has dismantled commercial agriculture without replacing it with any other way of producing food efficiently and effectively."
"The – Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper – is still closed, despite the courts ordering its reopening, and now the news editor and chief reporter of the have been arrested under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act."
"What we want is a renewal of the sanctions against Zimbabwe, which are up for renewal by the EU on 20 February 2004."
"Equally, we want a further widening and strengthening of sanctions against the regime, with the introduction of additional measures to make international action against the regime more effective, in particular the stringent enforcement of the visa ban."
"There will be a meeting of the EU-African Union Foreign Ministerial Troika on 1 April, and we hope that the EU will put it high on the agenda."
"We welcome the intervention by Archbishop Desmond Tutu following the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Nigeria, but would call on other African leaders to equally intervene and put pressure on Mugabe to take action."
"We need the donor community to make available food aid that can be distributed through non-governmental channels; and we want the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to galvanise the international community into taking coordinated and effective action against this intolerable regime."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I just wish to say a few words to state how much we deplore and condemn the situation the Mugabe regime is imposing on its people and on its country, Zimbabwe, turning one of southern Africa’s richest countries into one of the poorest and most underdeveloped, with constant and increasing attacks on human rights."
"I also wish to note the reasons why we support this compromise motion for a resolution, which once again, like the others that we have tabled in the course of this parliamentary term, condemns the regime and which calls for sanctions to be re-imposed and for diplomatic pressure to be exerted on Mugabe that will lead to the democratic transformation of the country."
"I also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to provide more practical support for representatives of civil society."
"I recently asked the Commission about this matter and I was satisfied with the answer Commissioner Nielson gave. He said that the Commission intends to continue providing assistance to representatives of civil society in order to support projects and/or activities in the field of human rights and democratisation and to help them to promote internal dialogue, an approach that we support and which, incidentally, is reproduced both in our own motion for a resolution and in the compromise text."
"We would like this support to be more specific, however: what specific actions are being undertaken, with whom, with what means and how actively?"
"I believe that closer cooperation between the Commission and Parliament to mount political pressure could perhaps achieve more effective results."
"We need to achieve more effective results not only because of the growing tragedy in Zimbabwe, but also because this could be a focus for instability and could set a bad example."
"We were worried to hear news recently of similar actions or rather news that similar actions were being planned in Namibia too, even though this is not the official position maintained by that country’s government."
"There is also news – which led to some fellow Members tabling a written motion for a resolution – of an abnormally high murder rate of farmers in the Boer areas of South Africa."
"This is one aspect of the persecution of farmers in Zimbabwe that should also concern us because it could spread throughout southern Africa."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, we have discussed Zimbabwe on many occasions in this Chamber, and it is extremely tragic to see how this well-off country with such huge potential has headed straight for the abyss."
"Zimbabwe has for a long time been a completely lawless country, economically impoverished and badly affected by AIDS."
"It has a dictatorial, mad old leader who has completely lost contact with reality and with his own people."
"Precisely when one imagines that things could not be worse, new reports come in that the situation in the country has deteriorated further."
"The human suffering and famine are becoming worse and worse, and there is an acute need for humanitarian aid."
"Mugabe must go."
"That is the only chance for the people of Zimbabwe."
"Now, the surrounding world must respond with vigorous countermeasures."
"Everything has failed so far, but the sanctions must be intensified."
"The whole of the international community must be crystal-clear in its condemnation of Mugabe’s regime and tell him that our patience is exhausted."
"No contacts, no exchanges and no sporting events, together with renewed and more stringent sanctions, are what we require."
"We must seek a broad coalition, which includes the SADC countries, in order to take measures and put pressure on the regime."
"South Africa’s silent diplomacy, as it is termed, has shown itself to be completely ineffective, but South Africa must nonetheless be prevailed upon to use its contacts to put pressure on Mugabe."
"At the same time, we in the EU must support the opposition."
"There is a small number of incredibly courageous people who – at danger to their own lives and, in some cases, at the loss of their lives – are trying to fight for democracy and human dignity in that country."
"I hope that the Commission is able to guarantee that the EU will continue to support these courageous people."
"Mr President, African countries have made solemn commitments to democracy and the protection of human rights on numerous occasions: under the NEPAD agreement and the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement, to name but two."
"However, the chaos and the oppression of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe has led to no satisfactory response from Zimbabwe's neighbours, who seem deaf to the cries of anguish from the oppressed people of that country."
"Not only have southern African countries been unwilling to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe, they have also allowed him to dictate the terms of Africa's relationship with Europe, and that is worse."
"The European Union's relationship with both the African Union and the Southern African Development Community has been damaged by African states' insistence that banned Zimbabweans should be included in meetings in Europe."
"The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has also been severely disrupted."
"This not only undermines the founding principles of NEPAD and the ACP-EU relationship, but also means that major problems burdening Africa – external debt, AIDS, food security, conflict prevention, good governance and human rights – cannot be properly addressed."
"Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control."
"There are terrible shortages, and oppression is increasingly widespread and brutal."
"A once prosperous country has been ruined and destroyed."
"African states' refusal to take the initiative on Zimbabwe means that it is even more critical that EU sanctions against the ZANU-PF regime be strengthened."
"This House has already called for them to be extended on six separate occasions."
"To date, the Council has failed to heed these calls."
"The EU travel ban against the Mugabe regime has regularly been breached in its first year and subsequently weakened to facilitate the entry of banned Zimbabweans into Europe."
"The resolution before us today calls for renewal of EU measures when they expire on 20 February and the introduction of tough new sanctions."
"It calls for the right of residence in Europe of those subject to the travel ban to be rescinded, for members of their families to be barred from employment and educational institutions in the European Union, for high-profile economic links with Zimbabwe that have given the regime international prestige to be curtailed, for those providing financial backing to the ZANU-PF regime to be identified, and for measures to be imposed against them."
"Yet again this House calls on the Council to respond to its clearly expressed wish: real, effective actions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe now."
"– Mr President, on Monday, 5 January 2004, the ran a trenchant essay entitled ‘Teargas for Haiti’ by the German author Hans Christoph Buch."
"What does that have to do with the tragic situation in Zimbabwe under its President, Robert Mugabe, our topic of debate?"
"Well, Buch’s essay is an open letter to the current President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, an old acquaintance of the author."
"Buch derides Mbeki’s stance on President Aristide’s regime in Haiti and President Mugabe’s in Zimbabwe."
"Let me quote: ‘Why did you not speak up for human rights to be respected in Haiti, and why do your protests against the ongoing violation of human rights in Zimbabwe sound so muted?’"
"Just like Buch, this resolution explicitly addresses South Africa’s attitude to the ever-worsening situation in Zimbabwe."
"Council and Commission, let your voices be heard!"
"Buch, forthrightly, asks Mbeki, ‘Or do you want to leave South Africa the option of the road already taken by Mugabe – the white minority as scapegoat for your own failures?’"
"It is this clear stance that I demand of the European Union in the forthcoming consultation with the African Union."
"– Mr President, we have not in fact added our signatures to this resolution, and I want to tell you why."
"Not in any way do we dispute the description of the misery in Zimbabwe, and we can endorse the rigorous condemnation of the Mugabe regime, but we have problems with pointing the finger at the surrounding countries and saying that it is they who have to remove Mugabe from power."
"We certainly want to see Mugabe out of office."
"We know that there is a well-organised and courageous opposition, but we are demanding things of the countries of Southern Africa that we ourselves are unable to do."
"What are our own sanctions actually achieving?"
"Nothing so far – and I have to tell you that the surrounding countries are particularly susceptible to pressure."
"It is the case that the violence is threatening to spread to South Africa, it is true that there is talk of land reform and that people who have nothing but weapons are now marching on the white-owned farms to take the law into their own hands – not only in Zimbabwe, but also in South Africa."
"The land reform in Zimbabwe is a disgrace."
"It has done nothing to put an end to people’s misery; far from it, it has made a few rich people even richer."
"We are perfectly well aware of that but, rather than pointing the finger at one side only, we must look for effective measures."
"Even the elephants are fleeing Zimbabwe in the knowledge that the national parks are being plundered, that the wild animals living in them are bereft of any protection and are being slaughtered, not only by poachers but also by people who hunt these animals out of their own desperation."
"As people flee Zimbabwe, they are arriving in the neighbouring countries."
"I therefore urge that we resume dialogue with vigour and examine ways in which we can help the well-intentioned regimes in Southern Africa."
"– Mr President, in the 1990s I worked as a trainer and advisor for a large Finnish development cooperation organisation."
"Zimbabwe was our one cause for pride, our favourite example of what development cooperation and genuine partnership achieves."
"It was proof that Africa was flourishing."
"What destroyed Zimbabwe?"
"I am not now going to repeat that pitiful and seemingly endless list of factors the resolution mentions."
"That would be too much."
"Destruction has permeated Zimbabwe’s entire social structure, from healthcare and education to the trade union movement and agriculture."
"Africa’s formerly productive model country is in a state of chaos and its economic structures are in tatters."
"In inciting people to occupy land illegally, instead of implementing controlled land reform within a reasonable timeframe, Mugabe flouted the law of the land and so devastated the functioning core of society."
"That is what this issue is about."
"When the basis of the legal system is destroyed the structures break up one by one."
"The fact that President Mugabe, former fighter for independence and national hero, degenerated to the level of dictator to keep watch over his own country is a tragedy of our time."
"I was a member of Parliament’s delegation of election observers in Zimbabwe a few years ago and we were simply amazed when during the elections someone had the nerve to declare that the government would remain in power whatever the result was."
"Despite intimidation, people voted."
"In Zimbabwe that could mean not only taking risks but also walking for miles to a polling station and queuing for hours."
"That was a sight to behold for someone used to a system where voting is easy."
"I wish everyone who is scornful of voting and representational democracy could just see queues like that even once."
"Let us in the EU give our unambiguous support to those who, despite oppression, have the courage to fight for law and rights."
"– Mr President, it is lamentable that the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe is turning into a never-ending story."
"There are no positive developments within it to speak of and few from outside it to report."
"The only positive aspect that comes to my mind is that the Commonwealth, at least, has not changed its stance on Zimbabwe."
"The Council, too, though, when the situation first got worse three or four years ago, took a very ambivalent approach for a very long time."
"As the main criticism in debates on matters of topical and urgent importance is often directed at the Council, I would like representatives from it not only to be present on such occasions, but also to make statements on the accusations levelled at it."
"Where the travel ban is concerned, the Council always hides behind what it claims to be obligations under international diplomatic agreements, when – as usually happens – ministers from Zimbabwe are again allowed in."
"Nowhere is it stated that a criminal regime must be accorded all diplomatic honours."
"Of course one can take diplomatic reprisals against those who fail to abide by any human rights convention."
"Of course you can also seize these people’s bank accounts and freeze the money until such time as circumstances change."
"Nor, in my view, has the Council really made plain to South Africa the seriousness of our insistence that it too should bring this necessary pressure to bear."
"I do not believe that we can sit by and wait for this problem to resolve itself."
"We can of course try to avert our gaze, but the situation will become ever more pressing."
"Other Members have already referred to the situation that people face, to the many millions of them who are already in South Africa illegally, and I see this as a situation in which pressure is needed, and must be brought to bear from every quarter."
"There is no reason why our own governments should look away when these things are going on."
". Mr President, the Commission is following events in Zimbabwe closely and is deeply concerned at the deterioration of the humanitarian and human rights situation there."
"In the light of the dire political situation in that country, and as no sign of a commitment from the government of Zimbabwe to take tangible measures to remedy the situation has been forthcoming, there can be no justification for lifting or easing European Union measures against Zimbabwe."
"The Commission will therefore consider extending those measures for a further year."
"The Commission remains fully committed to, and has even stepped up, its provision of direct assistance to the population of Zimbabwe in the form of food aid to cover essential needs."
"This month an extra EUR 20 million was pledged for food aid operations owing to evidence of continuing significant requirements and the absence of other donors in the critical period up to the harvest in May."
"This brings our total funding for food and humanitarian aid for the current season to EUR 85 million."
"We continue to be very active in providing support to projects in social sectors and in the field of democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"This sort of support was specifically excluded from the measures taken against Zimbabwe in order to protect the population and to promote progress."
"To be more specific, and in response to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I would remind the House that Zimbabwe is a focal country in the context of 2002-2004 European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights funding."
"That initiative should be viewed as a catalytic instrument for achieving significant results in protecting civil society and ensuring that critical voices can continue to make themselves heard within society."
"The Commission continues to provide assistance for capacity building for human rights and democracy NGOs that carry out basic human rights work and for civil society actors by enhancing their capacities to promote internal dialogue."
"In the last two years – 2002-2003 – almost EUR 2.5 million was allocated to specific projects under the EIDHR."
"Finally, the Commission continues to explore all possible avenues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and is pursuing an enhanced dialogue with its neighbouring countries, and notably the Southern African Development Community and the government of South Africa."
"It will support any peer pressure that the international community, and African heads of state in particular, can bring to bear on the government of Zimbabwe to improve the political, economic and humanitarian situation in that country."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the close of debates."
"– The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"– B5-0014/2004 by Mr van den Berg and Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Burundi;"
"– B5-0017/2004 by Mr Corrie and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Burundi;"
"– B5-0021/2004 by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Burundi;"
"– B5-0024/2004 by Mr Van Hecke, Mrs Malmström and Mrs Flesch, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Burundi;"
"– B5-0027/2004 by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the assassination of the Apostolic Nuncio to Burundi;"
"– B5-0029/2004 by Mr Collins and others, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on Burundi."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I can say we will be supporting this compromise text on the situation in Burundi."
"We were all shocked by the brutal murder of Monsignor Michael Courtney – the Apostolic Nuncio, and a man who had been playing a key part in the peace process in Burundi – in a road ambush on 29 December 2003."
"All the indications are that he was murdered by Agathon Rwasa's rebel FLN."
"Despite the murder, we welcome the fact that the FLN has now expressed for the first time a willingness to engage and meet with the President of the Republic with a view to opening peace negotiations."
"Last November saw the peace process gather momentum, with the signing, on 16 November, of a peace agreement between the transitional government of Burundi and the Forces for Defence of Democracy movement."
"Yet fighting is still going on in several provinces, especially in rural Bujumbura."
"The UN Secretary-General has rightly said that the Burundians must experience an improvement in their living conditions if this peace process is not to be jeopardised."
"The human rights situation continues to get worse, and so we urge the African Union and its Member States to exert every possible pressure on the FLN with a view to bringing them to the negotiating table in an attempt to seek a peaceful political settlement."
"We call on the UN Security Council to consider the rapid constitution and deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation to support the peace process at this crucial moment and to strengthen and complement the African Union's peacekeeping mission, which has already been deployed."
"We also call on all states participating at the Donor Conference for Burundi to make sure there are sufficient funds for human rights promotion and protection."
"Mr President, Burundi has been plagued by violence and tension between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority for many years."
"Democratic elections were held in 1993, which gave some hope for the resolution of this bloody conflict."
"However, this progress was short lived, as the newly elected Head of State was assassinated and this triggered yet another massacre."
"Since this period, Burundi has lurched from crisis to crisis, with many thousands of people losing their lives in the process."
"A ceasefire was brokered by Nelson Mandela in 2002 but later collapsed."
"A second power sharing deal was signed in 2003, which finally brought three of the main rebel groups into government, although, regrettably, fighting and abuse of human rights continues in several areas."
"Only the National Liberation Forces rejected this deal and this group has been linked to the death of the Irish Archbishop, Michael Courtney, who was the Vatican's envoy to Burundi."
"Archbishop Courtney was heavily involved in the peace process and played a significant role in bringing about this recent progress."
"Unfortunately, he paid a high price for his noble and unselfish involvement in the Burundi conflict when he was murdered by rebel groups on 29 December 2003."
"This was senseless and a terrible tragedy for his family, friends and colleagues from the church."
"As Mr Ford also pointed out, Michael Courtney made a valuable contribution to the current peace process in Burundi and I would hope there will be a full inquiry into his death which will bring those responsible for his death to justice."
"Perhaps the tragedy of his death will intensify regional and international pressure on the FNL to sign up to the peace agreement following their long-overdue talks with the government, so that no more lives are needlessly lost and so that peace is finally restored to Burundi."
"– Mr President, nobody knows the precise death toll in the creeping genocide in Burundi."
"The figure of 300 000 has been quoted – an enormous figure for a small country, but the reality is that we do not know."
"The murder of the Nuncio is one of the latest acts of senseless violence."
"The signing of the peace accords has reduced the violence, but the situation is highly unstable."
"The FNL, which still refuses to enter into any agreements, is being reinforced by disaffected elements from the earlier rebel movements that, despite earlier agreement, continue to resist."
"There are armed militias returning from the Congo, many other armed gangs wandering around and enormous numbers of handguns circulating among the population, handed out by the government itself, allegedly for people’s self-defence."
"There are of course obstacles to the acceptance of the latest group of rebels, for which we are calling, for what real motivation is there to accept them?"
"Those who accept the peace agreements must then give up their seats in government, and the Hutus will then be even more of a minority in relation to the Tutsis."
"I am aware that these are very sensitive issues in Burundi, but it is known to be the case that the groups that agree to peace must themselves bring on board new signatories to the peace agreements at the cost of their own seats."
"You will understand that this, in Africa, is a very difficult thing to do."
"A genuine human rights agenda has to be implemented in Burundi, for the continuing violation of human rights is a scandal."
"Finally, the UN peacekeeping force that we support is probably needed more than ever, as the African peacekeepers have inadequate resources and cannot operate effectively enough."
"It may be that we can improve matters in the meantime, for this is a matter of extreme urgency."
"Perhaps then there will be less need of a peacekeeping force from outside."
"Mr President, Commissioner, naturally, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party strongly condemns the murder of the Irishman, Archbishop Courtney, and demands that the authorities immediately carry out an extensive investigation to find out who murdered him."
"The people responsible must be held accountable and punished."
"The important work for peace done by Archbishop Courtney must not, of course, die with him, but must live on."
"We also extend our condolences to his family and relatives and to the Irish people."
"Perhaps what happened may lead to the Irish Presidency intensifying its work to support the peace process in Burundi."
"It is unclear who murdered Archbishop Courtney."
"The rebel movement, the FNL, has denied all involvement, but nor does it support the peace process."
"We would, however, call upon them to lay down their weapons and support the peace process, and we would also express our pleasure at their having in actual fact agreed to meet Burundi’s President and engage in talks with him."
"Perhaps that will lead in time to support for the peace process and negotiations."
"Burundi is a tragic country in every respect, with extensive destitution in social and humanitarian terms, a good deal of violence, especially against women, and acts of considerable cruelty involving a disregard for human rights."
"The peace process is very fragile."
"Many people are guilty of extremely serious war crimes."
"We strongly oppose any move to grant these people any kind of general exemption from punishment."
"Burundi should instead implement what was decided in the Arusha Agreement and ratify the charter of the International Criminal Court, or ICC."
"The wounds in Burundi following 300 000 or more murders will never heal if justice is not seen to be done and the murderers not held accountable."
"People must be given the opportunity to move forwards, and the national process of reconciliation must continue."
"We support the setting-up of a UN peacekeeping operation and hope that the EU may do all it can to help in supporting the peace process."
"We have high expectations of the donors’ conference later this year."
"Mr President, on behalf of my political group, I very much welcome the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Burundi and in particular acknowledge the cross-party support for the condemnation of the brutal murder of Archbishop Courtney on 29 December 2003."
"I am quite sure that Archbishop Courtney's family and many friends will appreciate the support of the European Parliament at this time."
"Michael Courtney was known to many of us here in Strasbourg when he served as Observer to this Parliament."
"We came to know and admire him as a man dedicated to his calling, his work and to peace."
"He went to Burundi as Apostolic Nuncio and it was there, while returning from a pastoral visit in one of his dioceses, that he was murdered."
"We have lost a true friend."
"I would like to tell the House that on learning of his appointment he told me and some parliamentary colleagues that he had a premonition about going there, but he brushed that aside and set about fulfilling his mission there."
"We have lost a brave and distinguished friend and I would like to express my thanks to the Irish presidency for the acknowledgment of the life and work of Archbishop Courtney made by An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during his response to yesterday's debate."
"It is typical of the man that he died trying to fulfil his mission of peace."
"I am particularly pleased that Parliament's resolution recognises and appreciates the quiet and effective ways in which Archbishop Courtney had been helping the peace process and alleviating the suffering of the people of Burundi."
"He had been instrumental in persuading some of the rebel groups to give up their armed struggle and had helped to secure the release of hostages last June."
"It is my sincere wish that his legacy will now be recognised as a man of peace who worked tirelessly for all those in need."
"The military option in Burundi must be abandoned once and for all."
"The recent peace agreements must be swiftly implemented."
"On-going hostilities and human rights abuses must halt."
"Initiatives by the international community, focused on obtaining a political settlement, must ensure that human rights issues are addressed at every stage of the peace and democratisation process."
"– Mr President, we are shocked by the murder of Archbishop Courtney, whom, in the five years that he was here in Strasbourg, we knew as a diplomat, pastor and also as a personal friend."
"I simply have to say that he was one of the truly great ecclesiastical figures in the tradition of the great Irish churchmen of the Middle Ages, who was always actively committed to the cause of peace and humanity; it was he who made it possible for us, here in Strasbourg, to join together in a service once a month, something he started along with a few of us in this House."
"I can still remember how Archbishop Courtney took his leave of us when he went to Burundi to actively involve himself in the peace process there."
"As soon as his aircraft landed there, it was shot at; there were rockets to welcome him."
"He then, in peril of his own life, spent five years participating in the peace process, drawing on the wide experience he had gained from his missions in trouble spots on four continents."
"He was meant to go to Cuba this week to take up office as papal Nuncio there and help human rights and freedom of religion to prevail."
"His mysterious, brutal and deliberate murder put a stop to that."
"We should honour his memory."
"He would certainly not, though, want his murder to be the only reason for us to focus on Burundi and thereby forget that murder is a daily occurrence in that country."
"In recent years, over 200 000 people have been murdered there, not because of what we term ethnic conflicts, but because of a deliberate policy of genocide, and the fact that the situation in nearby Rwanda is even worse, and that in its neighbours Uganda and the Congo no better, should not hide from us the fact that we have a special obligation to this region, tormented as it is by ethnic killings that know no borders."
"Europe does have obligations here, and our respect for Archbishop Courtney and for his legacy demands that we take appropriate action."
". Mr President, the Commission joins in the strong condemnation of the brutal murder last month of Archbishop Michael Courtney, and expresses its deep sympathy to his family and to the Holy See."
"The Commission calls upon the government of Burundi to find and bring to justice those responsible for this heinous crime."
"The Commission notes, with some optimism, the news that the armed movement, the FNL, is prepared to negotiate with the transitional government of Burundi."
"We very much hope that these negotiations will finally lead to a ceasefire agreement and the integration of this group into the transitional government."
"Events in the last year have demonstrated that the consolidation of the peace process is achievable."
"The Commission has closely followed and strongly supported the peace process in Burundi, using the instruments at its disposal to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation."
"For example, we made food aid available for combatants to support the ceasefire of December 2002 and used the rapid reaction mechanism to support the deployment of African Union observers in April 2003."
"The Commission did not wait for the establishment of the peace support facility to prepare an emergency programme to support African Union peace-keeping in Burundi and to make available EUR 25 million for the African Mission in Burundi, keeping the peace on the ground."
"The financing agreement for this programme, seeking a timely contribution to peace, was signed in Brussels this morning during the visit of the President of Burundi."
"The Commission is also contributing to economic and social reconstruction."
"Our rehabilitation programme amounts to EUR 48 million and focuses on economic and social infrastructure destroyed by the civil war."
"Last August, the Commission signed with Burundi the national indicative programme for the Ninth European Development Fund."
"This programme, for EUR 172 million, will make available much-needed budget support and promote rural development and good governance, including support to the transitional institutions."
"As the Commission confirmed at this week's Donor Conference on Burundi, this new programme comes on top of the ongoing programmes amounting to some EUR 200 million."
"Humanitarian assistance, through ECHO, will be continued in 2004, and EUR 15 million is earmarked for that."
"It should therefore be clear that the Commission has the means and the intention to make a substantial contribution to the peace process and the reconstruction of Burundi."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the close of debates."
"The next item is the joint discussion of the following motions for resolution:"
"– B5-0015/2004 by Mr van den Berg, Mrs Junker and Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Haiti;"
"– B5-0018/2004 by Mr Khanbhai, Mr Gawronski and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the situation in Haiti;"
"– B5-0019/2004 by Mrs Schörling and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on Haiti;"
"– B5-0025/2004 by Mrs Flesch, on behalf of Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Haiti;"
"– B5-0028/2004 by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Haiti;"
"– B5-0031/2004 by Mr Andrews, on behalf of Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the situation in Haiti;"
"– B5-0032/2004 by Mrs Sandbæk, on behalf of Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, on Haiti."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we now come to yet another extraordinarily sad topic for debate."
"Haiti was once seen as a glimmer of hope for slaves taken from Africa to America, who were able to join together in establishing a free republic there."
"Today, 200 years after Haiti achieved independence, we cannot but note that it is poor, broken-down and wracked by violence as never before, and those who have seen the place first-hand can only sink into pessimism."
"I have met the present President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on two occasions."
"The first was a number of years ago, when he was still regarded as the shining light of potential democratisation in Haiti."
"Those who had turned out in large numbers to elect him by a large majority had believed that, having been freed from the dictatorship of Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier, they would now be able to have a new life in a bright future."
"This, unfortunately, turned out to be a great mistake, and he too was driven out of office."
"During his exile, we covertly smuggled him into the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Santo Domingo, for we too believed that Haiti could have a good future under Aristide."
"My second meeting with him was after the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, when I had the honour of leading a delegation that the Committee on Development and Cooperation sent to Haiti."
"It was apparent from this encounter that we are dealing with a man who no longer has any idea where he is coming from, but that is not, in my view, the worst of it."
"We are dealing with someone whose views are akin to fascism – there is no other way of putting it – and who treats all democratic institutions with utter contempt."
"So it is that Haiti has, for the past three days, again been without a parliament, as the term of office for the deputies expired on 12 January and there is no prospect of new elections."
"There are, admittedly, still a handful of senators in the second chamber, but that does not legitimise anything."
"What we are seeing here is a failure to hold elections, the falsification of ballots, the intimidation of the electorate, of whom – as was apparent the last time – only some 5% turn out to vote, most preferring to stay at home where they feel safer."
"Such is day-to-day political life in Haiti."
"It is not always possible to separate political and criminal forces."
"Death squads dispose of those opposition elements who incur the regime’s displeasure, and journalists who try to maintain something like standards of independent reporting are persecuted and even killed."
"I could go on in this vein for hours."
"We will have to support those forces that are combating these abuses; the caravans of hope are coming together."
"We should be supporting these forces in the hope that things in Haiti may take a turn for the better."
"– Mr President, as Mrs Junker has just said, Haiti has been independent for 200 years, and, when the terrible Duvalier dynasty of Papa and Baby Doc came to a belated end over ten years ago, we thought that things could only get better, and, indeed, at first they did to some extent."
"Mr Aristide carried the hopes of many, but we can all see what has happened in the meantime."
"It is not only we Europeans who must ask ourselves where we went wrong with our policy over many decades, what we did or failed to do: the Americans certainly must, for they are closer to hand geographically speaking."
"Why did the western half of Hispaniola – which is a large island – turn out like this?"
"Of course not everything is ideal in the Dominican Republic on the other side of the border, but, all the same, the fact that millions of Europeans and Americans go there as tourists and at least bring some money into the country is an indicator that things cannot be that terrible."
"The situation is not yet ideal, but this does show that you can stay in the place with some degree of safety."
"It is certain that we must look to ourselves for answers as to what we did wrong."
"This House has been making very concrete demands of Haiti; political murders must be stopped; members of the ruling party must be compelled to uphold justice and maintain the law; the militias, the armed brigades and the so-called special brigades of the police must be disbanded and disarmed, and a start must be made on a national dialogue between the government and the opposition, so that the caravan of hope can reach its destination."
"What would be best – and what we demand – is that this should be done through the mediation of the United Nations, and that the UN Mission must be re-established to work together with the Haitian police."
"The conditions have to be created under which the suspension of the Cotonou agreement in accordance with its Article 96 can again be lifted, for our support is urgently necessary, especially in the areas of education and health."
". – Mr President, it would have been good if, for once, our agenda could have included reference to a happy event relating to an ACP country, namely the bicentenary of Haiti’s independence."
"When the country became independent, it put an end to the slavery and exploitation of an entire people, which had lasted for decades."
"What kind of celebrations can there be, what kind of congratulations can we offer to the Haitian government, such has been the downfall of this country, in which all optimism has been reduced to nothing?"
"A vicious circle has dashed the hopes and extinguished the symbol represented by Haiti."
"President Aristide, previously a torchbearer for democracy, and reinstated by American intervention, has drowned Haiti in the mire of the third world."
"The country has degenerated into a caricature of the poorest of the poor on the American continent and within the ACP."
"A collapsed social economy is strangling the population and discouraging local and regional aid, while the black market prospers in the hands of the highest echelons of the regime."
"The environmental disasters of deforestation and floods have heaped further misery on a desperate people."
"Giving up in the face of such chaos would be the final nail in Haiti’s coffin."
"Two centuries of Haitian independence have revealed the resourcefulness, the will and the ideals of the people, who represent the seeds of a rebirth of democracy and prosperity."
"Condemnation of the current regime and situation, however, cannot hide the difficulties that exist and the abuses committed by countries of the region and of the West, within their framework of assistance."
"Let us remember that not even the UNDP’s cry has evoked a response that will result in humanitarian aid."
"The international community’s disarray leads only to a lack of investment of resources and attention."
"The EU’s cooperation agreement must be capable of adapting to the current situation, in conjunction with regional and international organisations."
"We must not be daunted by Haiti; rather, we should view it as a challenge and a laboratory of transition for the EU in its cooperation with the ACP countries."
"While remaining resolute, we must encourage dialogue with civil society, and request a UN mediator to reach a long-term political agreement, in order to help the Haitian people back onto the road to democracy and sustainable development."
"– Mr President, the appalling situation in Haiti is partly attributable to the violence perpetrated by armed gangs on which the regime relies, but mainly to the abject poverty suffered by the majority of the population."
"President Aristide, its Head of State, certainly deserves no sympathy, as he has betrayed the hopes that his people placed in him."
"One cannot help but feel deep disgust, however, when politicians from the major powers, in particular France and the USA, who are overwhelmingly implicated in Haiti’s fate, begin to lecture and moralise."
"Two centuries ago, Haiti was one of the wealthiest countries in the Caribbean, but has become one of the poorest in the world."
"This is because it has been constantly pillaged and because France, its former colonial ruler, has never forgiven the country for winning independence by armed struggle and a slave revolt."
"Over the course of the decades, newly-independent Haiti has been subject to a blockade by France, with the complicity of the US and UK, in order to force Haiti to pay compensation to the former slave-owners."
"It is certainly in order to court mass popularity that Aristide is today demanding reimbursement of this colossal sum, which Haiti was obliged to pay until the twentieth century."
"This claim does, however, have historical legitimacy, and paying back the stolen money would enable the country to establish an infrastructure, a road network, a water supply system and a health care system, which it almost completely lacks, and that would be only the start."
"On a more general level, the sum required to alleviate the poverty of this country located a short stretch of water away from the wealthy USA would be a pittance for the major powers."
"Instead of helping Haiti, however, these major powers continue to pillage the country, with the few French and USA companies established in the country paying scandalously low wages, and taking back to the USA all the profits made on the backs of Haitian workers, rather than investing profits productively."
"It is precisely by showing solidarity with the people of Haiti that we can dissociate ourselves from the cynical and hypocritical declarations of those who claim to defend their freedoms."
"Mr President, it is extremely sad that the way in which we, here in the European Parliament, are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Haiti’s break with oppression and slavery is with a statement about the drastic situation in the country."
"I must not use my speaking time to repeat everything that my fellow MEPs have said about President Aristide."
"Historic injustices are difficult to remedy, and reconstruction of a country demands not only the right leader but also the right institutions to control him."
"A number of things have gone completely wrong in Haiti."
"Neither Parliament, the courts nor the police function, and there are daily reports of serious human rights violations."
"The most basic right, that to food, is being violated to a quite incredible degree."
"Half the population is starving, and 23% of all Haitian children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, factors that are a direct threat to Haiti’s prospects."
"The EU and the international community cannot, and should not, look on silently."
"The humanitarian aid must correspond to the Haitian population’s real needs, and the strongest possible political pressure should be exercised to get the parties to enter into dialogue and work towards a political solution."
"A political solution is the only way of reintroducing a system providing legal certainty and respect for human rights, and the only option for solving the structural problems that have brought Haiti to the brink of famine."
"Mr President, I speak in support of my colleague, Mrs Junker, who has spoken on behalf of the Group."
"Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas; 80% of its population live below the poverty line."
"It has one of the lowest life expectancies, literacy rates and health indicators in a region which, as someone has already said, is itself rather poor."
"The political, social and economic crises have all worsened in the last four years."
"Half the population suffers from malnutrition; there is difficult access to clean water and where traditional exports have collapsed, drug trafficking and corruption are flourishing."
"Worse, the recently-formed Haitian National Police has been able to enforce the rule of law and has been severely criticised by human rights groups for its own abuse of protesters protesting against President Aristide's rule and for failing to protect them from machete and gun-wielding government-supporting militias."
"We condemn all the violence and political assassinations."
"We call upon the Haitian Government, the opposition and civil society to engage in a constructive dialogue, possibly in the framework of a national conference to pave the way for free and fair legislative elections."
"We call on the Council and Commission to use all political and diplomatic means to encourage the Haitian authorities, opposition parties and civil society to facilitate this dialogue."
"In the meantime, we ask for the restoration of the United Nations mission working with the Haitian police, the disbandment of the so-called special brigades – as suggested by the UN Special Envoy – and the disarming of the militias."
"That would be the first step on what may be a possible path to a solution."
"– Mr President, I am happy to be able to express to this House the congratulations of the Dutch Platform on Haiti on this joint draft resolution."
"At the same time, as a Christian and a co-signatory of the petition, I put into practice the wise Biblical saying: ‘let other lips praise you’."
"In contacts with workers in the field, I always ask what practical help the European Union can give."
"I gladly endorse the suggestions that committed experts on Haiti have made to the Council and the Commission: firstly, that there should be support for local food production programmes and improvement in health care; secondly, careful observation of the human rights situation on the ground by the European delegation in Port-au-Prince, with careful reports on it sent to Parliament; and finally, the encouragement of constructive dialogue between government, opposition and civil society in accordance with paragraph 3 of the draft resolution."
"The attacks this week on various radio stations in Haiti, which are the source of information for the country’s people, underline once again the urgent need for European action in Haiti."
". Mr President, the European Commission shares the concern about the political, economic and social situation in Haiti and particularly at the absence of an agreement which would allow a solution to the political crisis in the country."
"We encourage all parties in Haiti to respect Resolution 822 of the Organisation of American States and to work towards a rapid political agreement."
"This is necessary to allow free and fair elections to take place in the near future in a climate of security and mutual respect."
"A key element in the resolution of the crisis is the formation of a credible electoral council."
"Despite the announcement of elections, this key element is still not in place."
"The Commission recalls that for the last three years Haiti has been subject to appropriate measures adopted under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Last December the Council decided to extend the measures for a further year."
"Under these measures, some Community aid to Haiti is suspended."
"However, the Community still provides considerable support of direct benefit to the Haitian population."
"Actions to strengthen civil society and the private sector, to support democratisation and strengthen the rule of law, to fight poverty and to give humanitarian and emergency assistance are being pursued."
"The European Union intends to remain present in Haiti and to promote a solution to the political crisis."
"Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law constitute essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Such elements are not in place in Haiti."
"Normalisation of the EU's relations with Haiti depends on the fulfilment by the government of the conditions of the OAS resolution."
"In a letter sent by the Commission and the Council at the beginning of January 2004 to the government of Haiti informing it of the extension of appropriate measures, the Union urges the government rapidly to translate its commitment to comply with the requirements of OAS Resolution 822 into concrete actions, which would lead to free and fair national and local elections."
"The Commission is ready to provide support for elections in Haiti if they take place in accordance with the resolution."
"Over the past few years, ECHO has responded to natural disasters mainly flooding by funding relief operations."
"In addition, Haiti has been a priority in ECHO's programmes, which support activities to improve vulnerable populations' preparedness for disaster."
"Current funding for such projects in Haiti amounts to more than EUR 1 million."
"The Commission's growing concern with the deteriorating situation in the country is reflected in the fact that Haiti is listed as one of the forgotten crises in ECHO's 2004 strategy."
"Parliament may be assured that the Commission is actively promoting a solution to the political crisis in Haiti and is using the means at its disposal to respond to the urgent needs of the Haitian population."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The joint debate is closed and we shall now proceed to the vote."
"(1)"
"–The Conference of Presidents has approved, in its sitting this morning, an amendment to the title of this report. It should now read ""a Community framework for collective management societies in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights""."
"The services will ensure that this amended title is translated into all languages."
". – Mr President, I wish to table another oral amendment."
"Have no fear: it does not take up any new issues."
"I have noted that one of the amendments has been incorrectly translated, and I do not think it accurately reflects the opinion of the Committee."
"The text of item 8, which I have also forwarded to you, should properly read as follows: 'considers that, in the area of collective exercise of rights, the enlargement of the European Union means that there is a need for suitable measures and that action may be required'."
"I think Members need have no qualms about voting for this."
"– Mr President, I am an interested party in this matter and so I have not taken part in the debate, nor will I be voting."
"– Parliament has completed its agenda.(1)"
"Wishing everyone a safe journey home to their countries, I declare this sitting of the European Parliament closed."
"15 amendments could be accepted in their entirety:"
"29, 34, 52, 66, 67, 70, 94, 143, 146, 150, 152, 165, 192, 195 and 196."
"67 amendments could be at least accepted partially, or in spirit, or with adaptations:"
"5, 8, 9, 12, 24, 26, 31, 32, 39, 40, 46, 47, 48, 51, 53, 54, 55, 58, 62, 63, 65, 68, 71, 73, 80, 81, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 93, 95, 96, 97, 101, 102, 103, 106, 110, 114, 116, 136, 137, 138, 139, 141, 142, 144, 151, 154, 159, 160, 161, 162, 164, 181, 184, 185, 189, 190, 193, 194, 198, 199, 200 and 207."
"110 amendments had to be rejected:"
"2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 49, 50, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 69, 72, 75, 77, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 92, 98, 100, 104, 107, 108, 109, 112, 113, 115, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 140, 145, 147, 148, 149, 153, 155, 156, 157, 158, 163, 166, 167, 168, 178, 179, 180, 182, 183, 186, 187, 188, 191, 197, 201, 202, 203, 205, 206, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214 and 215."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 15 January 2004.(1)"
"– Mr President, I would like to question you on the information that you gave to Parliament on 12 January."
"On the basis of Rule 7(4), of our Rules of Procedure, you referred the letter that you had received regarding the mandate of Mr Michel Raymond to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Under the current circumstances, when the issue of a statute for Members of the European Parliament is putting this House and its privileges under the spotlight, at a time when the Committee on Budgetary Control is hunting down any hint of fraud, misappropriation or dishonesty regarding the European Union budget, I think that your decision is extremely controversial."
"The fact is that Mr Michel Raymond has been convicted, now that the French Supreme Court of Appeal has handed down its final judgment, of fraud relating to the European Union budget."
"The matter was, perfectly legitimately, referred to you by the national authorities, and I am told that you did not wish to just ‘take note’, as the Act of 1976 invites you to do, of the disqualification of Mr Michel Raymond, fearing that there would be a long drawn-out appeal before the European Court of First Instance, which has in fact been lodged by Mr Le Pen."
"Quite simply, in the case of Jean-Marie Le Pen, which has some aspects in common with the case that we are now addressing, the European Union Court of First Instance ruled very clearly on 10 April 2003, including an interpretation of the Act of 1976 and Rule 7(4), of our Rules of Procedure, on which you based your decision."
"In its Judgment of 10 April 2003, the Court states that the verification powers possessed by Parliament when it has to ‘take note’ apply ‘upstream of the disqualification’, and therefore of the vacancy of the seat."
"Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure provides for the President of Parliament to refer the matter to the competent committee where ‘the competent authorities of the Member States initiate a procedure which might lead to the disqualification of a Member of the European Parliament from holding office’ I therefore think, Mr President, that it was your responsibility, according to the Act of 1976, our Rules of Procedure and the case law of the Court of First Instance, to take note of the disqualification of Mr Michel Raymond and not to refer it to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Madame Berès, happily, on this question and the multiplicity of legal dimensions which you bring to my attention, I am not an expert and so I sought advice from those with expertise."
"I am advised that the course of action I followed was appropriate."
"I should like to quote to you the relevant part of Rule 7(4) : 'Should the competent authorities of the Member States initiate a procedure which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office, the President shall ask them to keep him regularly informed of the stage reached in the procedure."
"He shall refer the matter to the committee responsible. On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter'."
"That is what I have done."
"There is no point in having a debate on this, although I do not mind having a bilateral dialogue with you."
"I believe I have acted in accordance with the Rules."
"I have acted on the advice I took on the matter, which I believe was offered with no malice or prejudice."
"When I have the advice of the committee I will continue to act as my duty requires."
"I should like to welcome to the official gallery a Libyan delegation currently visiting the European Parliament."
"I am pleased to inform you that today our interparliamentary relations with Libya take a positive step forward."
"The delegation, from the General People's Congress of Libya, is led by Mr Ahmed Mohamed Ibrahim, Vice-President of that Congress."
"Mr Ibrahim, I welcome you and your colleagues, and underline the importance we attach to your visit in the present circumstances."
"The recent measures taken by Libya are a cause for some hope."
"We now need to build on that hope together."
"We thank you for being here."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the programme of the Irish presidency and the European Constitution."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to make a statement on the current situation in the Intergovernmental Conference and I look forward to hearing your views."
"As you know, in accordance with our mandate from the Brussels European Council, we have been consulting widely with our partners. The Taoiseach has already either spoken to or met most of his colleagues on the European Council and will have been in contact with all of them before long."
"Several more meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks."
"Foreign Minister Cowen and I have also talked to and met with as many of our counterparts as possible."
"We also discussed the IGC over lunch at last Monday’s meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"Notwithstanding the importance of bilateral consultations, we felt that it was also important to recognise the collective nature of the IGC and to have an informal discussion of where we stand."
"I was very gratified that there was full support for our approach at the General Affairs Council."
"The discussion was a positive one – there is considerable common ground."
"We are all committed to taking the work of the IGC forward and to concluding it as soon as possible."
"However, we all also recognise that there are sensitive and complex issues which remain to be resolved."
"In these consultations with our partners and all those involved in the IGC, including of course the European Parliament, we are seeking to build a complete picture of the situation in the IGC."
"We want to ensure that we fully understand the views and concerns of all, to listen to what everyone has to say and, through active dialogue, tease out the exact nuances of their positions."
"This will help towards the second and more complex phase of our mandate to draw conclusions from our contacts and prepare a report for the March European Council."
"I do not wish at this stage to speculate about what that statement will contain."
"We do not underestimate the complexity of our task."
"The issues to be resolved may be few in number, but they are highly sensitive and difficult."
"We will try to encourage progress, to build mutual understanding and to identify common ground."
"However, we cannot compel agreement in the absence of the shared political will to achieve it."
"There is an obligation on everyone to think not only of their own interests, but of the collective interest of the Union as a whole."
"In that context I want to reiterate the point made by the Taoiseach in Strasbourg, and also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Cowen, before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week: 'If it emerges that there is a real prospect of achieving an agreement during our presidency, then we will not hesitate to seize that opportunity'."
"We intend to submit the fullest possible report to the European Council."
"The Convention opened up the process of Treaty change and brought fresh perspectives to bear."
"We all – parliaments and governments alike – are accountable to our people, and the democratic authority of the Convention was underscored by the breadth of its membership."
"I am pleased that the great bulk of what was proposed by the Convention has stood throughout the IGC and will continue to stand."
"For example, the text clearly sets out the allocation of competences between the Union and the Member States, and the principles governing their exercise."
"It simplifies legal procedures and instruments."
"It creates a single legal personality for the Union."
"It enhances the role of this Parliament, and it also gives national parliaments an important part in the overall architecture."
"By incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the draft enhances the prominence of human rights in the work of the Union."
"The values and objectives of the Union are more clearly expressed."
"Its proposals on the creation of a single European Union Foreign Minister and External Action Service should make the Union’s external policies more effective and coherent."
"The Convention’s report remains and will remain at the heart of the IGC's work."
"But as a matter of both legal and political reality, governments are obliged to look very carefully at it, and in particular at those aspects which would affect them most directly."
"In due course it will be our duty to seek national ratification, in some cases through referenda."
"The efforts of the Italian presidency ensured that considerable progress was made in resolving most of the points raised by governments."
"The work done in the run up to the Naples Conclave in late November 2003, and at Naples itself, was very productive."
"The paper prepared immediately in advance of the European Council was particularly valuable and struck a very careful balance."
"While, of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and while there are aspects of the Italian presidency's good work which were not the subject of final consensus, we believe we must try, as far as possible, to maintain the excellent progress which has been made."
"When Minister Cowen appeared before the Constitutional Affairs Committee, he gave an assurance that the Irish presidency would be open, fair and balanced, and that we would listen to all views and work to accommodate them."
"I want to repeat that message here today."
"We have no hidden agendas, no pet projects."
"We are determined that nobody will be able to question our even-handedness."
"We may, or may not, succeed."
"But this House can be absolutely assured that we will put every possible effort into this work."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I recall quite a well-known proverb which says something like ‘Procrastination Road leads straight to Never-Never Land’."
"You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, were there when, a few weeks ago, the European Council in Brussels decided to take ‘Procrastination Road’ towards a European constitution."
"At the moment, in line with the thinking in Brussels, many of us have concluded that this ‘procrastinating’ timescale was preferable to reaching a bad agreement immediately, which would have undermined the work of the Convention."
"I would like to say, however, on behalf of the Commission and in particular on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino, that we will not resign ourselves to ‘Procrastination Road’ leading to ‘Never-Never Land’."
"The debate today, which this House wanted, is an opportunity for you to join with us in relaunching the constitutional process, and to preserve the European spirit that we have built up over eighteen months in the Convention."
"In order to achieve this, all our good will needs to be united: that of presidencies and Member States of the Council, that of Parliament, that of the Commission and of national elected representatives, with the support of the regions and organised civil society."
"In order to remobilise public opinion in general, we all need to work together to give this process hope again."
"The Commission’s contribution to this urgent task will be based on three convictions."
"The first is that we want a general agreement."
"A general agreement is not an agreement bit by bit or piece by piece, but an overall agreement, in which everyone can see a balance based on a text of which everyone is aware."
"This is why the Commission does not think that anything has been gained from the discussions in Brussels, as Mr Roche said earlier – particularly when the result would have been nothing more than a step backwards."
"Moreover, although there are tendencies that it is helpful to take into account when continuing a task that has been interrupted, these must be confronted in open, transparent debate and by the current situation."
"Naturally, we acknowledge the very useful work done under the impetus of the Italian Presidency, which was the subject of the preparatory document for the ministerial meeting in Naples."
"The second conviction is that we want an agreement solely based on the draft constitution drawn up by the Convention."
"This is the only thing that should be taken as established because at best, we do not think that anything better or greater can ever be done than this collective, democratic effort, which took eighteen months."
"You are of course aware of our institution’s position regarding this result."
"We think that on a few points it could be clarified, adjusted and improved regarding the composition and operation of the Commission, in order to broaden the scope of qualified majority voting and of course to make the procedures for revising the Treaties more flexible."
"However, like you, we wish to preserve its general balance, in particular with regard to finance and budgets."
"The third conviction is that we want an agreement as soon as possible."
"The Irish Presidency has, in a sense, started on what it has to do."
"It has restarted the work of listening and working between those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Commission supports – and will continue to fully support – the efforts and the method that you, Mr President-in-Office, have chosen, and these efforts are essential."
"It will be no easier to reach an agreement in November than in April or May 2004; in fact, I think that it will be much more difficult."
"If we allow the symbolic deadline of 1 May or 9 May, or the politically more significant one that is primarily your own, 13 June to pass by, the draft constitution will not be very far from what I called at the beginning of my speech ‘Never-Never Land’."
"In other words, the Commission supports all efforts, wherever they come from, to preserve this constitutional process."
"As you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the next meeting will be that of the European Council in March, where the Presidency will evaluate the results of its bilateral consultations and where we will all be able to verify the state of mind of the Heads of Government."
"We will see whether that state of mind is, as we hope, different in March to what it was in December in Brussels."
"This is why, Mr President, the draft resolution prepared by this House has the Commission’s total approval and support."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too wish to express my gratitude to the Irish Presidency of the Council, which, I believe, has given the necessary response to this House’s December resolution, and has got the debate moving."
"It has found new ways of structuring the way we talk to each other, and is applying the necessary sensitivity to getting us to do it."
"Taking all these things together, there is, in my judgment, a real chance of this House’s objective being approached even before 1 May or prior to the European elections, and of a result being achieved."
"I see this as important; we can all see that there is no desire to maintain the debate’s momentum until next December, nor to maintain the collective awareness of what was more or less already agreed under the Italian presidency, namely that we have to work to a tighter deadline in order to keep the two together."
"It is because this is generally known that there is ongoing discussion in the various Member States, and so I am aware of a general willingness to produce a result as soon as possible."
"At the same time, let us bear in mind what this House would like to see: further democratisation of the European Union, of course, and the Budget issue, which we see as decisive and to which I would like to return."
"There is the issue of transparency, so that the public can know who in Europe is responsible for what, and also, of course, the issue of efficiency."
"That is what we have to get to grips with at the present moment, and it will be decisive."
"I think it important that we should not explicitly specify certain models right down to the last millimetre."
"What has to be decisive is that the decision-making structure should be more efficient than that proposed in Nice, and should enable an enlarged Community to act; that has to be the crucial yardstick, and I believe that, if we take this as our basis and apply the requisite capacity for imagination, we will be able to find compromises that will enable this to be accepted by those countries that often have difficulties on this point, for it is connected – or can be – with other issues as a means towards reaching a compromise that, while being truly fair, does justice to the three goals of democratisation, transparency and efficiency."
"Let me now mention a final point."
"In the aftermath of Brussels, there has been so much discussion of a multiple-speed Europe, something we have always had within the Treaty, whether about the euro, Schengen or anything else."
"It was always the case, though, that everyone could talk to everyone else, in the same fora, and that all Members had the opportunity of joining in. What we are today describing as a necessity is a defence union."
"If we do not get the constitution, there will be irresistible pressure for a defence union to be established outside the framework of the European Union."
"We will then no longer be obliged to talk to each other every day in the same fora, things will fall apart, and then, rather than there being a multiple-speed Europe within the framework of the European Union, Europe will drift apart."
"The end result – not because anyone wants it, but because these things happen in the course of time – will be that, at some point in the next five or ten years, we will be where we were before 1914, in a Europe of alliances."
"I think we all should know how undesirable this would be, and so we should see it as our responsibility to get a result now."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we need the Constitution, and we need it for twenty-five of us."
"All this talk about ‘core Europe’, centres of gravity and multiple speeds is no substitute for the constitution; on the contrary, it leads us astray, into a patchwork Europe of plots and counter-plots, and that we must avoid above all else."
"Secondly, we need the constitution before the elections, as we have to send out a signal to the voters throughout Europe, who are increasingly impatient for this constitution to be adopted, for we know that nothing will be any easier in the autumn or next year; indeed, everything to do with the constitution will become more difficult."
"Thirdly, we know perfectly well that we must not have another failed Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is vital that we succeed this time round, and I support the Irish presidency’s desire to clarify in advance whether we can achieve a positive outcome."
"Let us, fourthly, stop putting question marks against what came out of Naples."
"We have traded arguments; we are where we did not always want to be, but this is where we must start from if we are to progress further."
"I know that most of the Member States are willing to accept Naples in terms of the consensus that the Italian presidency presented."
"Apart from that, there is one point on which I differ slightly from Mr Brok."
"Although it is certain that effectiveness is the benchmark, the yardstick of democratic legitimacy must also be applied to the decision-making processes in the European Union."
"I do think, though, that we will draw a bit closer together on this point in the course of the coming weeks."
"We will support the Irish presidency with all our might, not only as regards the methods by which it endeavours to achieve consensus, but also in terms of its goal of presenting, in March, a sketch of potential outcomes rather than merely a timetable."
"Let me conclude with words of hope."
"After this Monday’s informal meeting there is a little light peeping over the horizon; may it become, under this presidency, a European dawn!"
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if Mr Hänsch is listening, let me say that, although Brussels is a cold place at the moment, those of us who are motivated by the Christian faith are in any case always animated by hope and optimism, and that is why nobody can hamper our work on a European constitution; we too want the sun to shine."
"That it may well be for you lot; red is a fine colour, but not only by its associations with the European Socialists ..."
"... that is a misuse of the colour."
"Let us be serious; let us get back to 2004, which is, as we all know, a crucial year."
"On 1 May, ten countries will be acceding to the European Union, in which there will then be 450 million people – far more than in the USA and Russia combined, and that figure itself shows by its magnitude how necessary it is that we should have a basis on which these 25 States – and later more – with their 450 million inhabitants may be held together."
"It is important that we should be able, on 10 and 13 June, to present the voters with a constitution that will show us the way to get through this twenty-first century in peaceful cooperation, as our continent is peacefully integrated."
"Let me say, on behalf of the European People’s Party element in our shared group, that we see the constitution as the priority above all others."
"It was the experience of Nice that prompted us to set up the Convention."
"It was Parliament – I do not want to claim credit solely for our own group – that called for the Convention."
"I can tell you that if the Convention had been able to take decisions on its own, we would have a constitution today."
"What was proposed was, in principle, a right and proper project, and that is why we declare that the failure of the Brussels Summit must not mean the failure of the European Constitution and that everyone concerned should now learn from the Brussels experience."
"Apportioning blame will get us nowhere, and not only politics but also human experience teach us that blame is never, or almost never, to be attached to one person alone, but that it is always shared by many."
"We therefore urge everyone to seek out opportunities for compromise and to muster their capacity for it, for there is above all a psychological basis for success, namely that we should respect each other and that the small countries should be treated with the same respect as the large ones."
"A country may well be large, but that does not mean that it is on the right track."
"There are, then, no first and second-class Members of the European Union."
"One does hear some preposterous arguments used against the constitution; there are those who say that a constitution amounts to centralism and a European superstate, and the very same people who reject a constitution scorn Europe as being, in their eyes, nothing more than a bureaucracy."
"That is why we say that a constitution is our chosen means of making democracy and parliamentarianism realities in the European Union."
"Indeed, Mr Schulz, there are many that I have in mind, but I do not want to make you more famous than you already are."
"The constitution will strengthen not only this House, but also the national parliaments, which will be able to appeal, on the grounds of subsidiarity, even against legislation planned by the European Union, and it needs to be pointed out to the constitution’s detractors that it, for the first time, puts local government on a legal footing."
"In the event of any dispute as to whether, in accordance with the allocation of European competences, it is Europe or the nation-states that are competent, or if regional and local self-government is impaired, it is not merely politically but also legally of vast significance that the European Court of Justice can refer to the article that lays down how local communities govern themselves."
"There has been talk of ‘core Europe’ and multiple speeds, and I want to say how much I agree with what both Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch have said."
"Both have been Members of this House for a long time, so the slight differences of opinion that remain between them despite their intensive cooperation in the Convention can be overcome, and, should they be in need of conciliation, they will find plenty of members of our group ready and available."
"There is one goal in Europe towards which we must strive."
"We have one goal in common, and we want to reach it together."
"Those who talk in terms of a ‘core Europe’ basically want to revert to intergovernmental cooperation, and I can tell you that our group will not stand for it; we will counter it with determined resistance."
"Where there is a will there is a way ..."
"... and we need to respect each other; more than anything else, we need to trust each other."
"We have confidence in you, Mr President-in-Office, in your government, in your Taoiseach, in the President of the European Council, in your foreign minister, in you personally and in Commissioner Barnier too – that is all I want to say about the Commission today – and, if we take this path together ..."
"... and with determination, defending the Community of Europe, then, I am convinced, we will eventually be successful."
"A commendable new form of 'inter-faith' dialogue!"
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, aware that the Irish Presidency is very sensitive to poetry, allow me to begin by expressing in positive terms what Commissioner Barnier has said in a negative way."
"The universal Spanish poet, Antonio Machado, said in a very famous poem: and you have begun to walk, prudently but firmly, and I believe that Parliament should appreciate this."
"You are opening up the path and overcoming a very dramatic situation of deadlock, of stagnation, in Europe."
"We have heard the report from our representatives in the IGC, Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok, and what both of them tell us is that it appears the atmosphere has changed."
"I believe that Irish hospitality is playing a positive role in this and it is very significant that the atmosphere has changed for the better; and I even welcome the very positive words of Mr Poettering, who I am sure has spoken on behalf of at least three-quarters of his group."
"I imagine that the British Conservatives will not be happy, but I believe that there is clear convergence between us ..."
"Well, on behalf of 80%, I admit."
"There is a first important question which has not yet been resolved – and I believe that the Italian Presidency has not communicated a single document in this respect – which is the status of the modifications to the text of the Convention at the Brussels Council."
"Having heard the Irish Presidency and having studied these modifications in Parliament, I believe that further work has been done on the text of the Convention, that is to say, there has been no consolidation of these texts, and that is important in terms of assessing the backward movements which have taken place."
"We must, moreover, begin working in this regard."
"I also believe we must stress that a number of countries that were very critical at the Brussels Summit – and I include my own, Spain, together with Poland, Germany and France, amongst others – have publicly expressed by means of their ministers their will to reach an agreement."
"With regard to the two-speed Europe, I am going to say something very fundamental: the problem is not so much that there are two speeds, but rather how to persuade those who are applying the brakes every day to stop doing so."
"I believe that that is the crux of the issue at the moment, that is to say, we cannot make progress if there are a number of countries which are applying the brakes entirely."
"I believe that would be a good start."
"It is absolutely clear that we must try to prevent a second failure in the Intergovernmental Conference, but also, looking at it positively, it is very important that we are able to face our responsibilities."
"Why?"
"Because the Convention, with the participation of the new Member States and with the participation of some countries still in negotiations, produced a text, and we must offer the electorate – whom we are going to consult very shortly – a result of our work which allows the Union to work and operate more democratically and more efficiently."
"That is the responsibility which we share and, therefore, with a view to the elections, we must be able to take that position."
"I would, however, add further elements to this year’s timetable."
"Firstly, there will be a new Parliament and new Commission, and we cannot now deny them the right to propose the modifications they consider appropriate as well."
"The issue is not whether the next Presidency does it better, but that we may find ourselves in the situation of having to start from the beginning again, with the new Parliament and the new Commission."
"That is an important point."
"We are also dealing with important international decisions which will affect the European Union over the coming months: the reform of the United Nations, to which we Europeans are directly committed – tomorrow we will receive its Secretary-General – the situation in Iraq, the situation in the Middle East, and the European Union's international policy and responsibilities."
"Furthermore, while not making any threats or accusations, it is clear that we must tackle and debate, jointly and immediately, because they are in the timetable, the updating of the Lisbon strategy and of the financial perspectives, in other words, the economic dimension and solidarity within our Union, and we must try to do so constructively."
"It is unthinkable that we should make progress on the economic dimension and not do so on the political dimension."
"It is therefore extremely urgent – and I welcome the Irish Presidency’s will – that we act in a positive and proactive manner."
"Mr President, I also welcome the progress report from Minister Roche, my fellow .It is clear that we are moving on – sharpish – from the fiasco that we had at the summit in Brussels."
"I trust that it will be possible to reach agreement before 1 May."
"There are, however, three sets of problematical questions outstanding: the formula for qualified majority voting, the size and shape of the Commission and the scope of QMV."
"It would be unfortunate if our obsession with those first two great patriotic questions obscured the third – the scope of QMV – which is in some ways more important."
"The Italian presidency, mainly under pressure from Prime Minister Blair, unfortunately retreated in several ways from the Convention's modest and balanced proposals to extend the scope of QMV and codecision with the Parliament."
"The Italian so-called 'final compromise package' is not acceptable to the Liberal Group – nor, I suspect, to a majority of this Parliament."
"Especially objectionable would be a flight from QMV concerning the provisions on social security for migrant workers; the suppression of codecision from the clauses on the framework programme for research and development; the re-insertion of the national veto and the suspension of the legislative rights of this Parliament in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters; and the unwelcome supplement to the progressive clauses of a right of veto for any single national parliament – a certain recipe for frustrating the decisions of the European Council and for bringing on the ultimate sclerosis of the European political system."
"The Irish presidency is quite correct in saying that all Member States must move for the IGC to be able to succeed and none more so than the British Prime Minister, whichever personality that might prove to be."
"– Mr President, the Constitution is said to reflect the will of both the people and states."
"We know how the will of states is measured: it is decided by parliaments."
"That is not necessarily the same thing as the will of the people."
"If the Constitution is to be decided upon nationally, the large majority of our group think the will of the people should be measured by means of a referendum in all Member States."
"Those countries which adopt the Constitution will establish a new Union."
"The intention is to continue the work of the old Union."
"Under the Constitution the present Union will be suspended."
"This must be a unanimous decision under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States."
"If a country is in disagreement, that is its legal right."
"If the Union that many countries joined after a referendum is suspended, a referendum will also have to be organised regarding accession to the new Union in as many Member States as possible."
"The Constitution has been virtually finalised at an intergovernmental conference."
"The articles on military matters, among which there is a new model for structural cooperation, were agreed at Naples."
"These are not just about defence: a special additional protocol in it also provides for any demanding military operations that may be referred to as ‘peacemaking’, and which therefore also include invasion."
"In fact the EU is not now preparing for defence, but attack."
"Our group does not think this kind of militarisation of the EU is necessary."
"Neither should the involvement of NATO be written into the Constitution as has now been done."
"What still needs to be written into the Constitution is the rule that EU crisis management must be based on a mandate from the UN."
"Our group is prepared to participate in structural work in a social Europe."
"The draft Constitution, however, is not satisfactory in this area."
"We want to make changes to it to safeguard the provision of services to all EU citizens."
"We need social security and not European militarism."
"Our group thus wants a social Europe but there have not been any satisfactory decisions taken by the Convention or the IGC in that area as far as we are concerned."
"We do not think it appropriate that the Constitution was drafted in conjunction with talks on the EU’s new financial perspective."
"Member States cannot be forced to accept a constitution which their citizens cannot agree to."
"We need referenda."
"Ninety-six members of the Convention called for a referendum."
"They represented both the yes and the no vote in future referenda."
"Referenda are people’s democracy."
"– Three brief comments, Mr President: the aim of constitutional reform is to make the European Union more democratic and more effective, and not to calculate the balance of power between Member States."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has, however, stalled on this issue and it is clear that the decision-making method which allows the veto is the real cancer of the European Union, it is that which is killing Community solidarity of any kind."
"For the majority of my group, the text adopted by the Convention represented – or represents – a step forward, but certainly not a revolution."
"I am sure that there is a substantially large majority on that point in Parliament, but it seems to me that, in the words of the Presidency and in our debate, there is a fundamental ambiguity."
"We are all optimistic and hopeful, we are encouraging the Irish Presidency to do its best, but what is it that we are encouraging it to do?"
"We are even turning down any parliamentary initiative that might upset the Presidency, we are deciding not to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Spinelli, of the formal adoption of the Convention."
"I repeat, what is it we are encouraging it to do?"
"Mr Hänsch, if democratisation is a criterion of your assessment, then we cannot accept the results of Naples for the simple fact that the results of Naples represent, in the majority of their proposals, a backward step with regard to the Convention and, in certain cases, in particular where the budget is concerned and even as regards the current situation."
"How can you, as our representative, accept such a thing?"
"It is not possible!"
"It smacks of ambiguity, it is a contradiction in terms!"
"In my view, therefore, we really cannot be content with talking about whether the glass is half empty or half full."
"With regard to the five or six points on which agreement was more or less reached in Naples, I should like to hear what the Irish Presidency has to say."
"I should like to know what it will do and on what it will try to reach an agreement: on the text of the Convention or on what, Mr President, you have today defined as a good basis?"
"From what you said at the beginning of your Presidency, I gained the impression that the 82 points did not exist."
"So then: do they or do they not exist?"
"Are they or are they not a basis?"
"Frankly, I have not understood, and it seems dangerous to me that our two representatives take the view that this is a good basis for negotiation, because actually it is not, and this is not Parliament’s position."
"Secondly, a quick point: frankly, it seems to me, once again, that the ideal way that we can help the Irish Presidency is to mobilise Members and public opinion around a project for democracy."
"If we again decide to leave everything to the Intergovernmental Conference, in March and in May, we will end up with a project worse than that put forward in Naples."
"I therefore call on Members, on the various parliamentary groups, which are in the majority compared to my group, to insist on the idea of meetings, to insist on the idea of a major parliamentary initiative in the month of May, so as to stand by and assist the Irish Presidency, not leave it alone with its colleagues who, by themselves, will not make a better Europe."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the statement made by Minister Roche on behalf of the Irish presidency here this afternoon."
"I am glad to learn that at the meeting of the foreign ministers this week, there was a constructive exchange of views with regard to the need for the new treaty."
"Clearly the events of the Brussels summit of EU leaders last December are now well behind us."
"There is a strong, growing realisation that we must re-invigorate the process to put in place a new European Union treaty, and delay and prevarication, recrimination and confrontation do nothing whatsoever to move this political process forward."
"That is why I welcome the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council, our Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, is holding an extensive round of bilateral negotiations with European Union leaders at this particular time."
"This week already he has been in Madrid at a meeting with the Spanish Prime Minster."
"Towards the end of this week he is to meet the Polish Prime Minster."
"We will all be in a stronger position to make a judgment on the state of the negotiations to put in place a new European Union treaty when the Taoiseach gives a report of his bilateral discussions to the Council meeting of European Union leaders in March."
"We all know what the bottom line issues are. They are not a secret."
"One of the clear benefits of the EU Convention process is that we have a draft treaty that forms a basis for the present discussions."
"However, we need some European Union governments to move away from seemingly entrenched political positions."
"That is essential."
"A new treaty cannot be agreed unless some political flexibility enters the political process."
"We should all remember that we have a lot to be proud of in Europe at the moment and that the impasse relating to the finalising of a new European Union treaty should not detract from that."
"We are all looking forward to ten countries acceding to the Union on 1 May 2004."
"This historic event will herald an end to the artificial divide that existed in Europe since the end of World War II."
"The enlargement of the Union will strengthen Europe's voice on the international stage."
"In conclusion, I believe we all support the intensification of talks between the European Union governments so as to ensure that agreement can be reached concerning the provisions of the treaty."
"We urgently need to streamline the way we carry out our business in Europe and the sooner we secure agreement the better."
"– Mr President, a few days ago, the Polish Prime Minister gave what I thought was a quite astounding reason for reaching an agreement quickly on the constitution, saying that in six months time, it would basically have no use."
"Either Mr Miller is a follower of Father Ubu, which would not be at all surprising for a Pole, or, more probably, this statement indicated that Mr Miller had concluded that, as this text would not in fact get us anywhere, there was not any point in delaying its adoption for much longer."
"Because, my dear Commissioner Barnier, the debate is not between ‘procrastination’ and ‘Never-Never’, but between ‘somewhere’ and ‘nowhere’, and nowhere is exactly where this draft constitution is taking us."
"In reality, the European institutions, the Commission and Parliament combined, are clinging to this supposed constitution as if it is their last hope, while their policies, particularly this year, have clearly failed, and while public opinion is generally disenchanted, if we believe the latest Euro-barometer, which I think is enlightening on this subject."
"In reality, the only policies that are working at European level are those that are made outside of any institutional framework, as we saw with the joint approach by the French, German and British foreign ministers in Iran or as we are seeing with what we at least hope are the first steps of European defence, by the same three countries which have been able to break free of all institutional suggestions, all ministers and all commissioners wearing two or three hats."
"There will be a constitution, because the European machine cannot be allowed to fail, as you have all said."
"There will therefore be a constitution or something of that name."
"However, if it is a democracy, and in my mind a constitution is the privilege of a democracy, as Mr Poettering often says, a European democracy can only be established in one way, perhaps with the risks that it carries: through a referendum."
"If a referendum is not announced – and I regret that Parliament’s text, as usual, avoids this issue – Mr Poettering and others can be sure that the electorate, in June, will show you what they think of your supposed democracy."
"– Mr President, even though we do not yet know where we are with the isolated agreements that were or were not reached at the IGC before the deadlock in December, some people, and in particular the European Parliament, are calling for the negotiations to be speeded up and brought to a close quickly."
"We reject this idea for two reasons."
"First of all, the period gained through the deadlock in the negotiations would be better used for further discussion on this constitution."
"The deadlock point, which is the formula for the double majority vote, is not an insignificant one."
"In fact, it was crucial for national sovereignty, as were many other provisions of this draft."
"The chair of the delegation from the French National Assembly to the European Union, which supports this text, has acknowledged that, with regard to the double majority, and I quote: ‘from a national point of view, nevertheless our country had as much interest in the status quo as Spain and Poland ‘."
"I think that the negotiators should consider this admission as a warning."
"Secondly, we are hearing statements here and there about the negotiations possibly coming to an end just before the European elections."
"In this respect, I would like to warn those who, once again, wish to catch the citizens off guard."
"It appears that some people would like there to be an agreement just before the elections in order to shorten the debate and then be able to cite the election result, if it is sufficiently in favour of the federalist parties, in order to avoid a referendum on the constitution."
"This would be an illegal manoeuvre, as the European elections are meant to elect representatives to the European Parliament to deal with a very wide range of subjects, but not the possible constitution, to which different methods of decision-making would apply."
"We will fight any attempt to violate the law."
"I also hope, Mr President, that this debate will retain a minimum standard of honesty and dignity."
"– Mr President, it is not difficult to get up again when you have fallen down, so, as Commissioner Barnier was saying, we need to remobilise public opinion and our national politicians."
"This is the aim of the resolution that we are putting forward, which should be seen as an extremely strong political signal."
"Imagine that in our respective national parliaments the four main parties in our countries tabled a joint resolution."
"That would cause a stir."
"Why is there this level of consensus?"
"It is because we all agree that we need to bring the enlargement and the deepening of the Union into step with each other."
"The number of players is going to change, the playing field is changing, therefore the rules have to change."
"Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this resolution should be seen as something helpful, an encouragement, a stimulus."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is extremely moderate."
"On the one hand, it proposes that you use the Convention draft as a basis – in this respect, we hope that you will not move too far away from it – and on the other hand, it proposes, significantly, the date of 1 May and not 9 May."
"After that we will have a last sitting in Parliament from 3 to 6 May."
"We should not be politically forced to be a constituent assembly to compensate for the irresponsibility of the governments."
"Mr President, the resolution proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs sets 1 May as the date for a positive conclusion to the work of the IGC."
"I want to explain the reasons why: immediately afterwards the electoral campaign will begin and, before it begins, the Constitution must have been finalised, first and foremost so as to get the electors to go out and vote – otherwise they will be deluded and will not vote – and therefore submit it to their judgment, which is our democratic duty, our basic law."
"For the sake of clarity may I add, taking up the points made by Mr Duff and Mrs Frassoni, that for us the draft Constitution is the only thing on the table."
"The eighty-two points referred to by the former Italian President-in-Office of the Council, or the 45 amendments now being referred to, have been examined closely by us: they contain many points which are confusing and ambiguous and take many steps backwards."
"There is no consensus on them – at least not in the European Parliament – and I ask you, Mr President, to give that serious consideration."
"Mr President, I am acting in this Chamber as the spokesman for pensioners and old people throughout the whole of Europe, who, once again, have said to me: ‘We do not have time to wait for the European Constitution."
"We are eighty, ninety, one hundred years old: there is no time!’"
"So, I would ask the Irish Presidency to bear this in mind or, better still, remind all the other presidents of it."
"In particular, if this cannot be done, I would suggest, as an alternative, that more time be given to old people and pensioners."
"How?"
"Given that the President of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, appears to have grown ten years younger – as a result of plastic surgery, it is said – I would ask that all pensioners and old people in Europe be allowed to go down the same route, at the State’s expense, so that they can also become ten years younger and have time to wait for the European Council to eventually give us the Constitution."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I would also like to congratulate the Irish presidency on its approach and on the method it is taking, which I believe is the right one."
"However, my Group is of the strong view that if, through no fault of its own, the Irish presidency does not begin to produce results within a reasonable period of time, it will not be possible for our Parliament to continue with ‘business as usual’."
"It will become increasingly difficult for us and for many Member States in the Council to act as if this is an issue that can be set to one side for many months and years."
"A solution has to be found quickly for reasons that my colleagues have already outlined."
"May I also ask the presidency how it intends to find a compromise on the difficult issue of the voting system in the Council?"
"The overall majority wants the double majority system, yet one or two countries are holding out against it."
"How does the presidency intend to bring these countries on board?"
"What kind of adjustment mechanism or declaration is likely to be used to make this voting system acceptable to these countries?"
"Mr President, last year will probably not go down in history as the EU’s most successful."
"That is worrying, not only in anticipation of the turn-out at the forthcoming parliamentary election, but also because there is a danger of confidence in the entire European project being undermined."
"2004 will therefore need to be a very successful year, as it potentially can be, given the impending historic enlargement and unification of Europe."
"It is interesting to observe that the Norwegian Social Democratic politician, Thorbjørn Jagland, has nominated the EU for the Nobel Peace Prize."
"A Norwegian, please note."
"If this enlarged Europe is to work, irrespective of whether or not we receive the Nobel Prize, there must be clear rules and an orderly way of doing things."
"That is why a Constitution needs to be adopted, and it is only fair that people also have their say about such a Constitution in conjunction with the parliamentary election."
"It is unacceptable for certain countries not to wish to accept these rules but, instead, to want to proceed off their own bat."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can no doubt feel how much good will is directed towards you in this House."
"If it were just up to you and ourselves, we should have this Constitution ready as soon as possible."
"I hope that you can use all your diplomatic sleight of hand also to convince your friends in the Council of the urgency of the matter."
"Mr President in Office of the Council, given your familiarity with the text of the Convention, I would like you to tell me if, in all honesty, you are aware of a more complete, more appropriate text serving as a basis for a successful conclusion than the text of the Draft Convention?"
"I ask this question as you, like me, are well acquainted with the Draft Convention."
"I should also be grateful if you could enlighten me with regard to a question before us today – and not only here today, but also elsewhere – the famous Naples text of which so much is spoken and written."
"What exactly do we mean by ‘the Naples text’?"
"Is it the text of the Council of Naples that was on the table in Naples or what remains of it after being sifted through the Brussels Summit?"
"I should like you to clarify these two points for us with frankness and honesty."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, most of my colleagues have talked about the wonderful Europe, or about the Europe that should become a little more wonderful."
"I am going to talk about the despicable, vile, revolting Europe, the Europe that Mr de Villepin talked about in Moscow two days ago, the Europe that says nothing about an open war in Chechnya."
"Ten days ago, having had enough of this silence, I started a hunger strike, not to ask for the moon, not out of deadly desires or anorexia, as Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne said."
"I think that it is our Europe that has deadly desires, the Europe that is doing nothing about Chechnya."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you, and the Commission, one small thing."
"We have Article 14(3) of the EC Treaty, which allows the European Union to create blacklists of people who cannot enter European Union territory."
"However, it also allows the creation of white lists, in other words lists enabling people, in this case, Chechens, to move around and live in European Union territory in order to highlight their people’s cause, the cause of a people who have suffered genocide."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if, during your Presidency, with the help of Mr Vitorino, you could get this reform adopted, I would be very grateful."
"Mr Dupuis, your political point is important, but we are discussing the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"– Mr President, the Irish presidency has the chance to deliver on the great promise – made to the public ten years ago – that the European Union would become deeper before it was enlarged."
"We in this House advocate that this constitution be brought to completion, before 1 May if at all possible, but at any rate hand in hand with enlargement and prior to the European elections."
"I would also be interested to know what is still left for you to negotiate, and I urge you to stick as closely as possible to the Convention text."
"Mr Berlusconi never told us what the 82 topics were on which agreement was reached in Naples; perhaps they could be made public some time."
"I believe that the voting in the Council – this dual majority – must remain fundamental, as it is meant to facilitate decisions instead of more blockages."
"That is what your benchmark should be, and if the constitution does not come to pass, we face the threat of a two-speed Europe, which is what we do not want."
"Mr President, as someone who is at least a quarter Irish, I welcome Ireland’s presidency."
"Mr Barón Crespo is right: the British Conservatives do not mourn the demise of the European Union constitutional project and we give thanks for Spanish and Polish intransigence."
"As a document it was far too centralising and federalist in content for our taste, far too long and both prescriptive and inflexible."
"We say ‘RIP’."
"However, I hope that Ireland’s historic relations with the United States will serve to promote, if not a full, free trade EU-USA agreement – now that the WTO, post-Cancun, is fatally wounded – at least a common economic space for trade in goods and services, particularly financial services."
"Much more also needs to be done to implement the Lisbon agenda, as we see Germany now saddled by a deep recession."
"This is not helped by an overvalued euro and a one-size-fits-all monetary policy."
"With the Commission now taking it to court over the breaches of the stability and growth pact, Germany is effectively hoisted by its own petard."
"With enlargement, these six months will be great ones."
"I wish the Irish presidency all the luck for which its people are so famous."
"– Mr President, we often talk about people washing their hands of the matter."
"These words do not apply in this case, however, because, although they tried, the matter has not been washed away."
"In spite of the Intergovernmental Conference, the draft Constitution produced by the Convention is still on the table, amongst other things because of the impetus given by this House and words such as those spoken by its President, Mr Cox, last Monday in Madrid, demanding that the IGC finish its work and finish it properly, in time – in other words – for the European elections and – why not? – before the end of this legislature."
"Well, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"I would ask the Irish Presidency to support, and place its confidence in, the process; but also to demand that work be done, – and, moreover, be done publicly and transparently – on the draft Convention and not on mysterious compromises and shady deals that are incomprehensible or that amount to retrograde steps."
"Bilateral contacts may be useful, but the IGC is a body which must act jointly, debate and reach agreements on a final consensus."
". Mr President, I would like to take up the old phrase used by Mr Poettering during his contribution to this debate: ‘where there is a will, there is a way’."
"In this particular case, where there is a political will, a way can be found."
"That is the reality as far as this constitutional treaty is concerned."
"Members are aware, as I am, that the prize to be won in this debate, a constitutional treaty which is lucid and clear, even visionary, involving all the people of Europe, is a formidable prize."
"The European people and the governments of the Member States in working together have indeed shown that Europe is capable of doing formidable things."
"A huge amount of work has already been done and the Irish presidency is fully aware of this."
"Many Members have asked about the particular text and its starting point."
"The reality of all negotiations is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."
"We are working day and night to bring about the political will."
"On a humorous note, Mr Fatuzzo pointed out that we are all getting older."
"Indeed, he is quite right: none of us are getting any younger."
"He also suggested that we should offer plastic surgery to old-age pensioners."
"As you know Mr President, Ireland is very famous for non-cash benefits to our OAPs – free travel, free television, free phone, free electricity and so on. We have not yet given consideration to free plastic surgery, but Mr Fatuzzo's point is well taken."
"I am very grateful to this House for its good wishes."
"They will be of great assistance to the presidency in encouraging the leaders of governments who have difficulties in this matter to take those few extra steps."
"The prize is a formidable one, it would be marvellous if we could attain it sooner rather than later."
"Like the best plastic surgeons, Minister, thank you for those uplifting remarks!"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I am going to disappoint Mr Poettering by speaking on behalf of the Commission, in place of Mr Barnier."
"But that is the price of collegiality."
"I endorse everything that Mr Barnier said in his speech."
"I would just like to clarify the Commission’s position."
"We consider the basis on which to work to be the Convention text and we think that on certain points, the Naples text clarified the Convention text."
"While remaining faithful to the Convention’s proposals, we can draw out positive trends on which we need to work."
"However, certain aspects of the Naples text, and above all some of the bilateral negotiations that took place between Naples and the European Council in Brussels, reveal retrograde steps in very sensitive areas, such as budgetary powers or the scope of application of the qualified majority."
"These steps back do not deserve any support from the Commission and we do not in any way consider them to be a negotiable result."
"Indeed, as Mr Roche said, nothing is agreed until the whole thing has been agreed."
"There are also parallel initiatives, however, that have been taken following Naples that deserve our agreement."
"I will take the example of the agreement on defence."
"Defence is a fundamental point and one of the major areas of development for the future of the EU."
"The Commission welcomes the agreement that was achieved on defence at the Intergovernmental Conference, including the content of the protocol that was discussed following the conclave in Naples."
"The example of defence is a very good one."
"It is not about building a two-speed Europe on the basis of the agreement on defence."
"The agreement reached in such a sensitive area as defence shows that we need to incorporate this agreement into the constitution as a whole and ensure an overall agreement on the constitution, including the defence dimension."
"This is why we will continue to support the efforts of the Irish Presidency to secure an agreement on the European Constitution as quickly as possible and with as little delay as possible."
"That concludes the debate."
"I have received two motions for resolution to wind up the debate.(1)"
"The vote will be tomorrow."
"The next item is the Council statement on the Members' Statute."
"Mr President, at its meeting on 26 January 2004, the Council examined the draft decision on a Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"The discussion was based on the text as voted by Parliament on 3 and 4 June 2003, and on its subsequent resolution voted on 17 December 2003."
"In light of the request of Parliament that the Council respond as a matter of urgency to its resolution of 17 December, the presidency ensured that the matter was ready for consideration by ministers at the first available opportunity – last week’s Council meeting."
"Qualified majority support is, as Members will be aware, required for all Articles of the draft Statute with the exception of Article 12 which, in the consolidated text, deals with taxation, and that, of course, requires unanimity."
"The presidency's approach, therefore, was to ascertain if a qualified majority existed on all aspects of the proposal other than taxation and – if that was the case – to reconfirm that the Council unanimously approved the taxation elements, an integral part of the overall proposal."
"In the interests of full transparency, I want to clarify that the basis on which the presidency invited Council to take a decision was that the proposed salary level for MEPs would be 50% of the salary of a Judge at the Court of Justice at the time of the relevant Parliament resolution – EUR 8 670 a month."
"The presidency’s objective was to secure political agreement on the draft Statute."
"Our approach has been clear all along."
"In his speech to the Parliament on 14 January 2004, the Taoiseach underlined the importance the presidency attached to the Members' Statute, welcomed the Parliament’s vote in December 2003 and said that we would do all in our power as Presidency-in-Office to deliver a positive outcome."
"In presenting the matter to the Council this week, the presidency restated in some detail its approach and its assessment of the situation."
"While it was evident that most members of the Council could support the package, believing that the Parliament had responded to the concerns of the Council, four members of the Council expressed their continued difficulties with the proposals and could not give their support."
"Following this indication of positions, the presidency was obliged to conclude that the requisite support for the draft Statute, in accordance with the terms of Article 190(5) of the Treaty, was not available."
"It was therefore not necessary to test whether unanimity could be confirmed on the taxation elements."
"The presidency undertook to report the outcome to Parliament."
"I am availing of the opportunity to do so today."
"It is important to be clear on one point in particular: the presidency spared no effort to ensure that Council would take an informed decision."
"Intensive preparatory work was undertaken in advance of the discussions by ministers."
"Clarification on particular areas of concern to Member States was sought from the Parliament and was, in our view, forthcoming."
"In all of this, I would like to acknowledge the assistance and support the presidency received from this Parliament and in particular from you personally, President Cox."
"Clearly I would have preferred to bring a different and more positive message to this House today."
"Unfortunately that is not possible."
"I feel it is important that, as presidency, I give you a clear and unambiguous statement of where matters stand."
"I should like to thank you once again, Mr Cox, for all the support and effort you put into this very important venture."
"Although we do not propose to take a debate on this matter, I hope the House will permit me to make a brief response on its behalf."
"First, I should like through you to thank the Irish presidency for the determined effort you have made in this regard, and for the integrity of purpose which you have brought to this task."
"As you reported, the presidency was unable to secure a majority."
"This is not a failure of the presidency; it may well be a failure of the Council, but one needs to distinguish between these things."
"I regret the lost opportunity that your statement indicates."
"I should like to point out - in relation to the work done by my predecessors and myself, and especially the unceasing work done by our rapporteur Mr Rothley and colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - that this is a very frustrating outcome from the point of view of the majority of this House after a long process of engagement between Parliament and Council, initiated in its most recent form at the Cardiff Summit during the British presidency in 1998."
"I express a personal disappointment in this regard and I believe that we in this House have acted in entirely good faith throughout our negotiations and our engagement with the Council in this regard."
"It is, I am bound to say, difficult to conclude an agreement with another instance of authority in the Union when the ground shifts and the goalposts are moved."
"We believed that the majority in this House last December had sought to reconcile the various points of view indicated in good faith by all of the actors at that stage."
"I believe this failure is, I regret to say, symptomatic of a Europe that is exhibiting a greater capacity for dysfunction than function on a key number of constitutional questions."
"I hope we can rediscover the spirit of Europe and not what blocked this important - and, in its own small way - constitutional initiative."
"I thank you again, Minister, for the work the presidency has done and again let me underline a strong personal view that the inability to deliver a positive result here today which you have conveyed to us is no reflection on the determined effort and the high integrity of purpose which the presidency and other presidencies in the past have brought to this important task."
"Mr President, I do not want to open a debate on this matter, but as you rightly said, this is a matter of constitutional concern."
"Moreover, it is part of the legislative procedure."
"It would be very useful for the House to obtain information from the presidency of the Council regarding the reasons behind and the justifications for the four previously mentioned governments' opposition to the Statute."
"We could then, perhaps, make progress."
"At this moment we do not know the reservations these governments have."
"If the Council is in a position, in due course, formally to enlighten us on this matter, I am sure we would appreciate such enlightenment."
"I am bound to tell you that, for those who have followed the dossier as closely as I have, the failure to achieve a majority on this occasion was a question of mixed motives."
"Perhaps we can, at a later date, have a fuller explanation."
"That concludes the item."
"The next item is the Commission statement on competition policy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution presented today is based on the debate of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs held during the annual report on competition policy for 2002."
"I want to give my sincere thanks to Mr Della Vedova for the important work he has done."
"Also, Mr President, I want to say how much I appreciate and how vital for me was the excellent cooperation with the parliamentary committees, primarily the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The proposed resolution does, in my opinion, accurately reflect that committee’s support for the Commission’s competition policy."
"I should like to take this opportunity to briefly explain the stage that competition policy is now at and give you an idea of the direction we want to take in the immediate future."
"As you know, during the current Commission’s term of office the reform of all competition rules has been started and, to a large extent, completed."
"The common aim underlying the various aspects of that reform has been to make our control procedures more effective and eliminate superfluous red tape, without undermining the substance of the competition rules."
"I believe that this can help to increase competitiveness, growth and employment in Europe."
"I should like to say a few words on each of the three main areas with which competition policy is concerned: antitrust, concentrations, State aids."
"In the antitrust sector, at the end of 2002, the Council adopted Regulation 1/2003 establishing a new framework for the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty."
"This regulation opens up a new chapter in the application of Community competition rules; in fact it is the biggest antitrust reform since 1962 and will enter into force on 1 May 2004."
"The following are the two main aspects of the new system: abolishing the notification system in respect of agreements between undertakings and establishing uniform conditions under which undertakings are to operate in the context of the common market."
"The application of Community competition rules shall become the norm enabling undertakings to carry out projects in a much simpler manner than happens under the present system where agreements between undertakings are governed not just by Community provisions, but also by 25 national legal systems."
"Simultaneously, under the new system undertakings are freed from the onerous burdens of notification and the Commission can concentrate all its resources on pursuing the most serious infringements of the competition rules."
"The reform mobilises the full potential of national competition authorities and national courts to contribute to the application of European antitrust regulations."
"A network of the 25 national authorities is currently being set up for the purpose of ensuring that tasks are more effectively and more efficiently allocated between the Commission and the national authorities; the Commission shall have the task – which is certainly demanding – of guaranteeing that the regulations are applied in a coherent manner."
"I could give much more detail, but I do not intend to do so now."
"I should, however, like to stress an aspect of this competition policy which will be proactive, based less on waiting for notifications and more on initiatives taken by the Commission and the national competition authorities; we wanted to give a special role to consumers, who are the ultimate beneficiaries towards whom our competition policy is actually directed, by means of, for example, a number of provisions designed to make consumer associations more involved in investigations into matters concerning competition, whilst also encouraging them to register complaints."
"I now come to the second part of our reform, which concerns the control of concentrations."
"I should like to point out at the outset that this control is not so interventionist as it might appear to be at first sight."
"The Commission certainly has no intention of hindering the restructuring of markets; concentrations are necessary to respond to the challenges of a developing economy."
"In fact, if we look at the statistics, we see that since 1990, of more than 2200 concentrations that have been notified, the Commission has blocked only 18: it is therefore an extremely small proportion, but blocking a concentration is of course more newsworthy than authorising it."
"The recently adopted reform of the regulation governing concentrations introduces a certain degree of flexibility into the time-limits for examining the operation, strengthens the one-stop-shop principle which is extremely beneficial for undertakings and stipulates that the essential criterion on which operations are to be assessed is that concerned with all types of harmful situations, whether involving the dominant position of a single undertaking or the effects of a situation where there is an oligopoly that could damage consumer interests."
"As regards the internal organisation of the Commission, in the area concerned with competition we have introduced a number of fairly radical innovations – which various Members have followed extremely closely and encouraged – including giving greater weight to economic analysis in the assessment of competition cases."
"As from September 2003, there has been a new figure, the Chief Competition Economist, operating within the Directorate General for Competition, who is providing a new input into our decision-making procedure in terms of economic analysis."
"I now come briefly, Mr President, to the third area on which competition policy is based, that is to say the control of State aids."
"Parliament and the Council have repeatedly and rightly insisted that the overall amount of State aids must be reduced and that, at the same time, State aids must be geared more to supporting horizontal objectives than to supporting, often artificially, specific sectors or single undertakings."
"As you know, Parliament has supported this move: in July 2001 we established an assessment framework – a score board for State aids – and the latest figures, from last spring, confirmed that there was a trend towards a reduction in the level of aids; when the new figures are issued this April we shall see whether this trend has continued."
"As regards State aids, just as I said a few moments ago in relation to antitrust and concentrations, we have attempted to redirect the Commission’s work towards those activities which are capable of causing most damage to competition in Europe."
"We still have an intensive work programme, from now until the end of the present Commission’s term of office, in relation to the State aids sector, a programme which is focussed on three main aspects: more effective amendments to working methods and procedures; developing simpler methods for dealing with less important cases of aid; reviewing the current substantive regulations governing State aids."
"Work on procedural reform is already quite advanced: we are in the process of preparing a regulation which lays down the implementing provisions of the Council’s procedural rules and we want to develop new instruments for simplifying the treatment of those aids which do not raise any significant competition problems."
"As a follow-up to the Commission’s Green Paper on services of general economic interest, in which this Parliament has shown such great interest, major priority will be given to clarifying the control mechanism governing the payment of compensation for costs associated with the supply of services of general economic interest."
"I shall stop now in order not to overrun the time allocated to me, but not before saying a few very brief words, Mr President, on what we have done during this time, once again with Parliament’s support, as regards the international dimension of competition policy, both by further developing certain bilateral cooperation relations between antitrust authorities – primarily with those in the US – and by setting up with other partners the first multilateral body on competition, the International Competition Network."
"We are hopeful that in this sector the governance of globalisation is flourishing, and not withering away, as is unfortunately happening in other sectors."
"I am, of course, available to listen to and, where necessary, comment on the speeches that follow."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Commissioner Monti for this report, which, as he stressed, follows on from the work done by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Most of your speech, Commissioner, you devoted to the technical work of reviewing competitiveness and to improving it."
"I believe, though, that where we have to exert more influence is on the issue of what must be done to make Europe more competitive."
"Reading the Commission’s report on competitiveness in 2003, it is quite clear to me that the businesses that achieved high levels of production growth were those in which organisational improvements go hand in hand with investment in new technologies, and especially in information and communications technology."
"What this means is that we have to be quicker off the mark, more flexible, more mobile, more industrious, more willing to embrace reform, starting by becoming more European in our thinking and then becoming more open to the world."
"We must, then, give all the participants in the internal market a level playing field, and do away with whatever obstructs the internal market and impairs its competitiveness."
"We have to make the internal market an internal market; our problems with competences in the areas of fiscal policy, labour law and working times mean that it is not one."
"Because social systems are a matter for the Member States alone, the EU, in all these policy areas, can do no more than beg and implore them to do the necessary homework."
"This means that it is important that we should now recognise the connections between the quality of the internal market, the EU’s ability to compete, the fulfilment of the Lisbon targets and the achievement of growth and job creation."
"Underlying all of them are our social market economy and stability."
"I urge you to waste no time in presenting the Member States with your list of requirements, with clear figures and timescales showing how we can make Europe more competitive and what homework the Member States have to do."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would be quite happy to agree with the points Mr Karas has just made, for there is little to be objected to in what he said, but, nevertheless, if we carry on debating with each other much longer – as the members of the committee already have been – very profound differences will keep on cropping up here and there, and I think we have to say something about these in order to understand each other a bit better."
"What is clear is that competition policy is an important and indispensable instrument, enabling the European internal market to function and facilitating ever-deeper integration, so that the gains in terms of prosperity and efficiency resulting from a large and integrated market can be put to good use."
"I called competition policy an instrument, and that is what it is, rather than an end in itself; if it were an end in itself, it would very rapidly degenerate into something purely ideological."
"Competition policy is an instrument that has to be subject to social and civil policy objectives and must help achieve them."
"The fact is, then, that we do not live and move in a free market economy, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ draft resolution puts it, but in an environmentally-responsible and social market economy."
"Mr Karas, you have just used the term ‘social market economy’, but you voted against it in the committee."
"It is astonishing how the Conservatives and Christian Democrats in this House have refused to talk in terms of the social market economy, and I can tell the Members on the other side of the House that they can correct their group’s embarrassing mistake in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in tomorrow’s plenary vote, by voting in favour of our amendments."
"Although we are in favour of tight controls on mergers, their strength must lie in their taking into account their effects on society and on employment and in their giving workers and those who represent their interests a say in decision-making processes."
"That is a suggestion for the Commissioner."
"We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are also in favour of tight controls on subsidies, but subsidies can be eminently justifiable if they lead to modernisation, improved competitiveness, innovation, sustainable growth and the creation of long-term employment."
"What I would like to see is even greater attention being given, when assessing subsidies, to the effects – including the positive ones – on the whole chain of exploitation within which the subsidy is made."
"We have already had a whole series of debates on this."
"My time is running out, so I will end with a question to the Commissioner."
"Commissioner Monti, you have now become acquainted with our resolution – from the last part-session in Strasbourg – on services of general interest, in which we spoke out plainly in favour of codecision by this House on a legal framework, which means that it cannot be regarded as assent only to a block exemption regulation – which is the impression I got from the Commission’s reaction."
"We have also asked whether there is to be a follow-up within the life of this Parliament, which has not much longer left to run."
"We cannot have any more long-drawn-out discussions, and so I would like to know how work on this within the Commission is progressing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to do as the Commissioner did and note that his area is one of the most important for European consumers."
"We have a number of current issues that, in actual fact, have a very great deal of bearing upon consumers: those of competition within the car sector, the decision concerning Microsoft and intellectual property rights."
"We know that, in October 2002, the new regulation, with exemptions for sales and service, came into force within the motor vehicle sector."
"Our intention was that it should increase competition and give consumers more."
"Unfortunately, it has had quite the opposite effect in the country I know best, namely Finland."
"Qualitative selection criteria have become quantitative, and the number of repair workshops for all the large makes of car has declined by several dozen."
"In Lapland, in northernmost Europe, repairs of particular makes of car can only be obtained in the county government seat of Rovaniemi."
"At the service station in medium-sized Muonio, five makes could be serviced on 1 October 2002."
"Now, no such services can be provided."
"What does the Commission intend to do about this matter?"
"Where Microsoft is concerned, we heard yesterday that the Commission is close to reaching a decision on Microsoft, Media Player and the abuse of a dominant position."
"We again call upon the Commission to finish its investigation as quickly as possible and to take decisions that guarantee a genuine market and freedom of choice for consumers."
"As emerged from the parliamentary question to Commissioner Monti in December 2002, we expect you to look seriously at this issue so that all new businesses are given a genuine opportunity to operate and so that certain standards do not become standards that reduce competition and the free flow of information."
"Intellectual property rights, together with the monopoly and the standards that sometimes come about mean that much of the right to competition is rendered ineffective."
"That too is something I hope you will look at, so that there is no repeat of the situation we experienced in my own country when the Market Court had to find Gramex (the Copyright Society of Performing Artists and Phonogram Producers) guilty of abusing its dominant position."
"When shall we see a decision concerning Microsoft?"
"– Mr President, I would like to speak on just one point – State aid for services of general interest."
"I am addressing you in particular, Commissioner."
"Through the Resolution of 14 January, Parliament has just confirmed its desire to legislate in this field."
"In our view, the Commission therefore urgently needs to say, ‘yes, we are going to prepare a legal act under the codecision procedure’."
"The aim is to increase the scope of public authorities to choose and to act, in particular local and regional authorities, and to ensure that the rules of the internal market and of competition are compatible with the inalienable rights in terms of services of general interest."
"With this in mind, we wish to establish common principles, criteria for specifying exemptions and derogations on competition rules and funding."
"We now have codecision power, with Article 95, interpreted in the light of Article 16 of the Charter."
"The draft constitutional treaty also aims to strengthen that power."
"I would like to point out that the Commission should implement the rules ex post, but certainly not decide on them itself ex ante."
"That is the job of the Treaty, the Court of Justice and the legislator."
"We are concerned about abuse of power by the Commission, in the name of its competence over competition, and we think that it has a degree of legal confusion, particularly as regards funding."
"First of all, it is not up to you to say whether or not funding is legitimate and in particular what is aid and what is not."
"It is only after the rule has been made that you should ensure compatibility with competition."
"There is therefore necessarily an area of possible conflict between the legislator and you."
"That is why, after the Altmark judgment, we ourselves wish to clarify under what conditions financial compensation under public service obligations is not covered by the rules on State aid."
"You wish to interpret Altmark yourselves through a communication, and we wish to do it through a legislative act."
"Secondly, the Commission, having been authorised by the Council, may decide to implement a rule of exemption from notification with regard to State aid."
"In fact, services of general interest have an increasingly economic dimension."
"However, our resolution rejects your use of Article 86(3) to decide everything yourselves, claiming an urgency that has been denied for many years."
"We are therefore asking you to establish a provisional derogation so that the codecision procedure can ultimately clarify the general conditions for validation."
"Thirdly, taking into account the disputes that there already are against your services and the bodies responsible for services of general interest, we have grounds to ask you to respect our resolution that services such as health, social housing and even social services should be excluded from the scope of application of competition rules and only come under the control of the Commission in the event of abuse of discretionary powers."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we wish the future codecision act to establish a right to own production, so that the threat of intrusion from the Commission will not always be brandished under cover of the argument of distortion of competition."
"Mr President, I will concentrate on the electricity market and competition policies in that market."
"On paper on 3 July 2004 we will create 25-country electricity markets."
"In reality, the market is becoming an oligopoly."
"Germany and France and their companies EdF, Eon and RWE presently control 40% of the electricity production in Europe and 50% of all the grid and the balancing capacities."
"So, Commissioner, you are asking for national competition authorities to able to act and to create competition in the national market."
"The Eon-Ruhrgas merger and the decision by the German Government show us that the German Government has the option of having national championship-building and is not playing the game of establishing a competitive market in Germany."
"Their idea, and this is also the idea of the French Government, is that their three companies will dominate the European market."
"These two countries have also been successful in blocking ownership unbundling, and thus the complete separation of interest between production and grid, which is necessary if you do not want these companies to control new entrants and you want more competition in the market."
"These two countries have also been able to block access to decommissioning funds, and thus these three companies buy up the other companies."
"My analysis, as Parliament's rapporteur on the electricity market, is that today in the European Union we do not have the relevant instruments to cope."
"The only country to be really successful in establishing a competitive market is the UK, because when the British opened the market they had a tough divestment policy."
"France and Germany will not touch divestment policy."
"We thus need an instrument to impose on them, at European level, the divestment of their two big companies."
"Otherwise there is no hope at all for competition in the market, for lower prices, or for innovation"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to make a general point."
"I address myself to you, President Cox: this is the first time in 25 years that the European Parliament has not been able to discuss the annual report on competition policy which, concerning an area that is increasingly more central to European politics – one only need flick through the daily newspapers – is one of the most important documents published by the Commission."
"In recent years, the debate in the European Parliament on the annual report has always been the most important – if not the sole – occasion for the democratic scrutiny of competition policy which, although having an increasing impact on the life of European companies and citizens, is one of the areas where Parliament’s role is merely consultative."
"Mr President, we have repeatedly called – as we did during the work of the Convention, on behalf of the European Parliament – for codecision in relation to competition policy."
"We have not been able, for the first time in 25 years, to secure a debate on the European Commission’s annual report."
"This conjuring trick – because that is what it is – which meant that we did not hold an open and timely debate in the European Parliament on the general outlines of the Commission’s competition policy, has led us to today hold – thanks to the availability of Commissioner Monti – a debate in a vain attempt to replace the one that we should have had."
"I believe that the Conference of Presidents has a grave responsibility; there has been a misunderstanding about the fact that this report – who knows how – as of this year should no longer be considered an obligatory report, but rather an own-initiative report."
"The Conference of Presidents did not want to remedy the situation which had been created and today we therefore find ourselves with half a debate, with a Parliament split down the middle on competition policy."
"This is, in my opinion, a very serious situation that must be noted and criticised as a disgrace in this Chamber."
"Coming now to the subject, Mr President, Commissioner, of this report which in reality brings to the plenary, in a manner of speaking, the report for which I was appointed rapporteur, adopted in committee, I want to make three points: first of all this report welcomes the commitment with which Commissioner Monti and the Commission have implemented a major programme of legislative and organisational reforms in the Directorate General for Competition."
"Last week the Council gave the final go ahead to the new regulation on the control of mergers: as Parliament’s draftsman on that subject, I must express my regret at the fact that the amendments – which I consider important – suggested by Parliament were not adopted, in particular as regards the automatic transfer to Brussels of some of the most important concentration and merger operations and powers."
"Two further points, the first of which concerns national champions."
"I agree with what was said a few moments ago by a Member in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: in Europe the process of liberalisation of crucial sectors such as energy is influenced by the policies of national champions."
"We have national champions in certain sectors – not just energy, but also telecommunications – which are often also national champions under public ownership, in which the State finds itself playing the dual role of controller and direct acting manager of companies."
"In such situations, in my opinion, irrespective of the difficulties involved – we are confronted with the major countries of the European Union, extremely large and powerful companies in Germany, France and also in Italy – the Commission must keep up its guard and, if possible, attempt to obtain more positive results than those achieved so far."
"Another point is that of the liberal professions: a key component for the future of the European economy which is increasingly a service economy."
"In so many countries the growth of that sector is stifled by the survival of corporate limitations which operate to the disadvantage of consumers and to the advantage of the professions."
"Finally, a more general point about competition policy, also in relation to the amendments tabled to the resolution that we are due to vote on tomorrow."
"I believe Commissioner Monti’s policy has a sole, crucial, extremely important objective: to guarantee fair competition, to guarantee competition in open markets for all European companies."
"It would be an extremely serious mistake and an illusion to think that the choices made by Commissioner Monti must have a direct impact on specific social or employment aims."
"The best way to guarantee employment, growth and resources earmarked for social measures is to guarantee economic growth and competitiveness in Europe."
"– Mr President, first of all, my compliments on the report by Mr Della Vedova: it is a good one."
"I share his objections to the highly unusual procedure that has been followed here for holding in this House a debate on competition policy."
"In my opinion, a debate on such an important part of Community law should be carried out through the front rather than the back door."
"The Commission has undertaken a substantial revision of competition policy, but unfortunately not all its changes are for the better."
"As rapporteur on merger control, I have already stated my opinion that it is wrong to force the Commission’s powers of investigation under the Regulation on merger control into line with those pursuant to the Regulations on cartels."
"Mergers are not punishable in themselves, but the formation of cartels is."
"I hope that the Commission will yet consider reversing this decision."
"The Commission’s persistence in shifting from the market dominance test to the ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC) test, too, against Parliament’s advice, is most regrettable."
"The market also needs clear competition legislation and a reduction in administrative burdens."
"Prior impact assessment of new legislation is a very important means to this end."
"Looking at the impact that the Regulation on distribution is currently having on the motor vehicle sector in the Netherlands, I can see developments towards the dominance of certain parties, particularly the importers."
"Of course, that was surely not the intention, and this is why prior impact assessments are potentially very important."
"I am currently working on a report on institutionalised impact assessments for European legislation, and I am assuming that the Commission will also subject competition legislation to an impact assessment in the future."
"In view of the imminent enlargement, it is most important for the Commission to examine state aid in the acceding countries and to make it transparent."
"I have heard reports that, in certain sectors in the acceding countries – the Czech banking sector, for example – the levels of state aid entered in the State Aid Scoreboard are incorrect and should be adjusted upwards."
"I hope that the Commission can shed some light on the course of action it intends to take if it emerges that candidate countries have given it incorrect information on the state aid they have granted."
"Finally, Mr President, I can tell you that I do not endorse the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The modifications that they propose relate to policy areas that are not covered by the Commission’s competition policy."
"These proposals would result in confusion and legal uncertainty."
"Mr President, according to the renowned French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi, whose astuteness and common sense we all admire, the EU’s economic government is run by just three people: the secretary of State in charge of fiscal surveillance, the minister responsible for monetary policy and the minister charged with coordinating and boosting support for competition policy."
"Fitoussi’s intention here is to stress the current fragility of the structure of economic governance in the EU, while acknowledging the vital role played by competition policy in economic governance."
"Executive, legislative and legal powers also fall within the competences of the minister for competition."
"Competition in European culture is a means of progress and development and never an ideological end in itself. It must consequently strengthen and consolidate a market economy that does not abandon its social dimension and always responds to the needs of the consumer."
"This policy must therefore involve all EU institutions, especially Parliament, as this is the body that represents all European citizens."
"At a historical moment, when the EU faces challenges in terms of social and economic progress, and when it also feels the need to re-shape the institutional framework that governs its workings, Parliament can hopefully take on new competences within the scope of this policy that are not merely consultative."
"Competition policy will only be successful, however, if the Commission is able to create equitable conditions, whereby rules can be applied across all Member States."
"Progress has been made in this respect during the past year, but this is an area of competence that requires constant work, especially given the difficult economic situation, which makes it opportune for Member States to use state mechanisms and aid in order to safeguard companies and their own citizens’ jobs."
"The report tabled by Commissioner Monti is to be welcomed and represents hope for an improvement in competition policy within the EU."
"Parliament’s motion for a resolution, subject to the approval of some amendments that have been tabled, will also constitute an extremely important guiding policy document and provide a sound basis of support for the Commission itself."
"Mr President, we are at the end of the mandate of the Commission and Parliament and therefore, on this occasion, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Monti on the excellent work he has done throughout the mandate of this Commission."
"Competition policy, as has been pointed out, is one of the fundamental policies which the Commission is responsible for."
"Its implementation and application is very difficult and subject to many pressures, I would therefore like once again to congratulate Commissioner Monti on his success in implementing this policy."
"Nevertheless, there are certain aspects which worry us and which other Members have pointed out."
"The first, naturally, is that we must not lower our guard."
"The pressure from economic and political interests to sidestep market rules is logical, and we must always balance, for the benefit of citizens and consumers, the free exercise of market mechanisms in order to ensure an efficient market with a correct allocation of resources."
"It is therefore obvious that we must counteract these pressures, since it is logical, and we economists know it, that the tendency of any company is to control the market, if it can be done in an oligopolistic way, all very well, but if it can be monopolistic, even better, and in certain sectors there are still very significant distortions, as has been mentioned here."
"The second point that I would obviously like to point out is the Liberal Group’s traditional position that there should be a section in the Court of Justice to deal with these issues."
"The third and final point would be to ensure, both in the Commission and in the other institutions of the European Union, that the operation of the courts responsible for competition, at all levels within the Union, is correct."
"If it is rigorous in certain areas but not in others, we are obviously giving comparative assistance which distorts the situation of the markets, and even more so, as has been pointed out, in view of the enlargement which will take place in a few months’ time."
"Having made these observations, which I would like to leave as suggestions for application in the future, I would like to repeat that we in the Liberal Group are in agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Della Vedova, and we congratulate Commissioner Monti on his wonderful work."
"– Mr President, while you are congratulating yourself on your competition policy, the workers of Aventis and Sanofi are filled with fear and awaiting redundancies and closures."
"They know that these stock mergers always lead to redundancies, in other words human catastrophes for those who make these companies work and often to the death of whole towns."
"I condemn a despicable system in which, in secret board meetings, a few individuals can decide the fate of thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of human beings."
"The European Parliament never condemns this type of dictatorship, for that is what it is, and this is one of the worst types of dictatorship."
"Moreover, in the pharmaceutical sector, we are talking about people’s health, and these corporations, which are some of the most profitable, make their profits by plundering social security."
"So why should the workers in those companies, the people, not have the right to monitor the decisions, why should they not have the right to force the billions in profits made thanks to the work done by them all to be used for something other than enabling the giants of industry to buy each other out, why should they not have the opportunity to force them to make the choices dictated by collective interests rather than just by those of the shareholders?"
"What I would like, would be for the workers to be strong enough to put an end to this uncontrolled power exerted by the major financial groups over the life of the economy, and therefore, over life full stop."
". Mr President, I wish to thank all Members for their support of the Commission’s competition policy, and even, in some cases, for their generous comments regarding this Commissioner."
"I must say not purely as a matter of course but out of full conviction that the dialogue with this Parliament and the support from this Parliament apart from minor disagreements on specific occasions has been, and I am sure will continue to be, a strong driving force for the European Commission in the area of competition."
"Several subjects have been touched upon."
"I will not be able to address each of them in depth."
"However, it seems to me that there is a large consensus on the fact that competition policy is indeed one key component of the social market economy."
"By its very nature, it addresses the market component of the social market economy."
"However, it is also connected with the social aspect, even though on some occasions this might not appear to be the case."
"It cultivates the market dimension of the social market economy and is specifically of benefit to consumers."
"The comments from right across the political spectrum, from Mr Karas, Mr Rapkay, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Doorn and others, although with different tones, fit into this general framework."
"Of course, imperfections remain in the single market."
"I totally agree with Mr Karas."
"Competition policy has to try to make the single market single and open and is therefore one of the driving forces of Europe’s competitiveness and economic development."
"As Mr Rapkay said, competition policy is an instrument, not an end in itself – I totally agree."
"It is a rather delicate and sometimes powerful instrument, but it is not an objective in itself."
"If it were, it would not be such an interesting instrument to operate."
"Mr Rapkay also mentioned the need for the strict monitoring of state aid, but also pointed out that state aid should not act against the need for sustainable development."
"Again I agree and, in particular, I would like to point out that some specific guidelines and frameworks in the area of state aid are almost explicitly aimed at sustainable development, for example those aimed at supporting renewable energies, employment creation and research and development."
"There have been many speeches about services of general economic interest, particularly from Mr Herzog, who as we all know is the rapporteur on this fundamental issue, and from Mr Rapkay and Mr Doorn, who particularly highlighted State aid in the new Member States, and from a few others."
"With regard to services of general economic interest, we have obviously very closely followed the Herzog report and the European Parliament resolution of 14 January on the Commission Green Paper on services of general interest."
"With regard to follow up on the Green Paper, there still needs to be a debate within the Commission on the nature of the proposal to be put forward."
"With regard to the funding of services of general economic interest, I would like to respond quickly to Parliament’s demand that legal security for enterprises be increased."
"Soon, following on from the Altmark judgment, I will propose a package to the Commission based mainly on three texts: firstly, a communication from the Commission specifying under what conditions public service compensation could constitute State aid; secondly, a Commission decision applying to small public services and hospitals, to obviate an obligation of notification under certain circumstances; and thirdly, a Community framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation, more for large public services."
"I will not go into further detail, because I still have to present these three texts to my fellow-Commissioners."
"Mrs Thors mentioned the car block exemption regulation, a subject which was also touched on by Mr Doorn."
"We are, of course, permanently monitoring the effects of the new block exemption regulation."
"Many questions were asked about the impact of the new rules; it is far too early, however, to draw a final conclusion, especially because, as Parliament will recall, the centrepiece of this structural change will only enter into force on 1 October 2005, when the location clause for dealers is abolished."
"In the meantime, we are closely monitoring compliance with the new block exemption regulation by all agents in this complex market."
"Initial trends indicate greater price convergence and we believe the process is fully under control."
"Mrs Thors referred to the situation in Lapland; we are always interested in learning of any situation that may present particular problems."
"Mrs Thors also touched upon an entirely different but not uninteresting specific case: that of Microsoft."
"She urged us to reach a prompt conclusion on that matter."
"What I can say in this context is that we are indeed nearing an end to this case."
"It is fair to say that we have investigated this case thoroughly and carefully."
"As you may recall, we sent three statements of objections to Microsoft."
"In November 2003 the Commission listened to Microsoft and interested third parties at a hearing in Brussels."
"This was the final step in our procedure and it should therefore come as no surprise that the Commission has reached a draft decision."
"I cannot, of course, go into any more details on this at present, as the Commission has a duty to keep its investigations confidential."
"However, I hope for the moment that this answers the point on Microsoft made by Mrs Thors."
"I often talk to Mr Turmes, who has had to leave, about issues of competition in the energy markets, of the importance of which we are all aware."
"I would like to respond to his comments referring to the E.ON-Ruhrgas case."
"He said that we want to give more power to the national competition authorities."
"That is the case in Regulation 1/2003 as it deals with Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty."
"However, it is not the case with regard to monitoring of mergers."
"The case concerned was one of monitoring of mergers."
"Mr Della Vedova, thank you for your continued and, if I may say so, particularly competent support; thank you for your opinion."
"You know that, on the question of national champions, we shall seek to follow – or, whenever possible, pre-empt – your invitation to keep up our guard."
"Indeed, the criticism is sometimes made that the European Commission’s competition policy does not do enough to encourage national champions."
"As regards the liberal professions, a subject we have already discussed in this Parliament, in February I will present to the Commission a report – which will subsequently be published – on the liberal professions in Europe."
"That report will indicate the subsequent steps that I felt could be taken."
"I agree with Mr Doorn that cartels and mergers are very different phenomena requiring the attention of a competition authority."
"We have worked hard on state aid cases concerning the enlargement countries, and will do so even more intensely and directly after 1 May 2004."
"I should like to thank Mr Santos very much for his support of our reforms, including in the field of state aid."
"Mrs Bordes, sometimes, human catastrophes may happen."
"That is your expression."
"Speaking in general terms, yes, there are sometimes sacrifices, at least temporary ones, associated with mergers – not always, but often."
"We also, however, need to consider how the European economy could gain the impetus to enable it, in an increasingly open global economy, to achieve – and if possible to increase – a degree of competitiveness in order to safeguard and increase employment, if it did not have the possibility of being regenerated and restructured, including through mergers."
"It is true that many studies show that mergers have not subsequently fulfilled the promises that those responsible attached to them."
"Our monitoring of mergers is – as you know – more limited; the aim of it is to check for the possibility of consequences that could be damaging to the competitive structure of the market and to consumers."
"Our role is not to replace the shareholders and others involved in the economic governance of the enterprise in taking the basic decision."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mr Gasòliba i Böhm again for his very generous words."
"We are going to issue a communication on the modernisation-related relationships between the national courts and the European Commission, and we are also supporting an effort – instigated in particular by Sir Christopher Bellamy – on initiatives for national judges in the area of competition policy."
"That concludes the debate."
"I have received one motion for resolution to wind up the debate.(1)"
"The vote will be tomorrow."
"Catalonia and the Kingdom of Spain have been experiencing a real political storm in the last few days."
"The reason I am discussing it is that it has affected our institution."
"Indeed, our President, Mr Cox, deferred the meeting that he was supposed to have only yesterday with the new President of the Catalonian Parliament, Mr Ernest Benach."
"The reason for all this is that on Monday, the Madrid daily newspaper ABC revealed that my Secretary General, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, who had just taken up the role of Prime Minister of Catalonia, had secretly – but not so secretly that ABC was unable to reveal it – met with leaders of the terrorist organisation ETA."
"With his characteristic courage and sense of honour, Mr Carod acknowledged the meeting, stating that it took place at the request of ETA, from which he hoped to procure a truce announcement."
"Since Monday, the anathemas have been pouring out from Madrid in an election-driven battle of indignation."
"Mr Carod has stepped down as Prime Minister, courageously heading up the list of candidates in Barcelona for the elections to the Cortès to take place on 14 March."
"Like a good democrat, he is letting the citizens judge his actions."
"In my view, there is no doubt about the verdict, which is the only one that counts, and I condemn the fact that the President of our institution refused to meet or deferred his meeting with the President of the Catalonian Parliament."
"Mr President, I want to raise the issue of various moves in some Member States, notably France, to ban the wearing of so-called overt religious symbols."
"The spotlight has fallen in particular on the hijab, the Muslim headscarf."
"In order to be consistent and non-discriminatory, any such bans would affect the Sikh turban, the Jewish kippa or skullcap, and Christian crosses."
"Such bans are misguided."
"Apart from the purely pragmatic argument that if you ban something then people want to do it, there are strong human rights arguments as to why banning is unacceptable."
"I refer in particular to Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to manifest one's religious observance in public."
"These guarantees are, of course, echoed in our own Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It must surely be arguable that a ban would breach the EU directive on equal treatment regardless of race or religion."
"Before France or other Member States find themselves condemned before the Strasbourg or Luxembourg courts they need to remember that a European model of integration rests on respect for differences and freedom to choose, not on illiberal imposition of uniformity."
"– I wish to raise a matter which, unfortunately, has been pending since August 2003."
"Five Community nationals, citizens of the European Union, are being held by the Pakistani authorities."
"The Greek-owned ship, the sank in Karachi harbour and, unfortunately, the cook is still being held, as are people from the salvage company who went there after the accident."
"All so that the Karachi port authorities can haggle with the insurance company over the insurance premiums which they should receive for the damage, which was indeed caused."
"I raised the matter with the President of the European Parliament before Christmas."
"He was sympathetic but, unfortunately, the matter is still pending."
"What I am requesting is that the President of the European Parliament intervene again, perhaps calling on the ambassador to Pakistan or even asking Commissioner Patten to tell us what demarches have been taken by the European Union."
"The Italian Presidency and the Commission had mobilised and we must not allow anyone to haggle over insurance premiums with citizens of the European Union as hostages."
"I shall ensure your remarks are passed on to the President of Parliament."
"The next item is the joint debate on the Single European Sky:"
"- Report (A5-0010/2004) by Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (PE-CONS 3690/03 – C5-0603/2003 – 2001/0060(COD))"
"and"
"- Report (A5-0009/2004) by Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint texts approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on:"
"1. air navigation services in the Single European Sky (the service provision regulation) (PE-CONS 3691/2003 – C5-0604/2003 – 2001/0235(COD))"
"2. the organisation and use of airspace in the Single European Sky (airspace regulation) (PE-CONS 3692/2003 – C5-0605/2003 – 2001/0236(COD))"
"3. interoperability of the European air traffic control system (interoperability regulation) (PE-CONS 3693/2003 – C5-0606/2003 – 2001/0237(COD))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have no hesitation in defining as a historical step the approval of this regulation on the Single Sky, which is the work of myself and my colleague Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, and of many Members who have contributed over the last two years to make this a fundamental commitment for our Parliament."
"I consider it important because it allows us to extend our philosophy, our challenge to also see European integration in our skies, and it enables us to attain two fundamental objectives: the first, immediate aim, is to create an integrated air space, governed by the same rules, the same guarantees; second, it also enables us to review the concept of sovereignty in order to adapt it more completely to the process of European integration in which we are currently investing our energy and resources."
"The first objective that this regulation has certainly achieved is that of safety."
"A report drawn up a few days ago lists the last 18 air incidents, the last 18 major air disasters recorded since 11 September 2001: we have calculated the total number of deaths at 2300."
"Not one of these disasters is linked to terrorist acts; they are air disasters linked to problems concerned with flight safety."
"So, in this sense our regulation makes a fundamental contribution."
"If air traffic grows at the same rate at which it has grown in recent years and if we do not take steps in relation to safety, as we are seeking to do with this regulation, then in the year 2015 – according to forecasts – we will have a disaster of this scale every week."
"The Single Sky is a fundamental contribution, a contribution that also seeks to have spin-offs in terms of organisation, efficiency and good sense."
"Currently in Europe there are 41 different air traffic control centres, each often having its own rules, with its own flight paths, its own corridors, its own flight quotas."
"From Rome to Brussels one passes through the hands of seven different flight control centres, and handovers are not always smooth: consider what happened over Lake Constance a few years ago when as a result of a misunderstanding between two flight control centres during a handover an aeroplane crashed to the ground."
"As a result of this regulation safety will once again become the priority of European policies."
"Another priority the regulation would appear to have established concerns costs and timetables."
"The growth of European traffic will take us from seven million flights in 1997 to twelve million flights by 2010, and today one in five flights experiences more than 20 minutes delay."
"It is clear that efficiency in terms of timetables and costs makes our companies competitive in the market: the US has more or less the same geographical area as Europe, but they have double the number of aeroplanes in the air and much shorter delays."
"How have we attempted to deal with these points and these issues?"
"We did so with the committed and knowledgeable support of the Commission, represented by the Commissioner, Mrs De Palacio, and with the good sense shown by the Council in this difficult conciliation phase."
"There are three points I want to touch on briefly: the first naturally concerns civil-military cooperation."
"In the compromise finally reached it was decided that explicit reference should be made to the statement of the Member States on military matters."
"In that statement the Member States acknowledge that air space can be used in a safe and efficient manner only if there is close cooperation between civil and military authorities."
"We consider it a milestone in the process of European integration: for the first time the military top brass of all fifteen European countries understand that the European skies are not anyone’s property and that a balance must be struck – at the highest possible level in terms of quality – between the defence requirements of all Member States and the safety requirements that are the main concern of the customers, that is to say European citizens."
"The second important point is the role played by Eurocontrol."
"We have attempted to take on board and make good use of, in terms of experience and efficiency, what Eurocontrol stands for and the role it could play in constructing this integrated European single space."
"To achieve that goal required cooperation whilst avoiding the duplication of roles and functions; cooperation with the European Institutions and the Commission is a must for this regulation."
"It has been established that Eurocontrol will be able to participate as an observer in the meetings of the Committee on the Single Sky; we are therefore moving towards a major stage in the contribution that Eurocontrol will be able to make."
"Finally, provision has been made for sanctions, at Parliament’s request, on the basis of an elementary principle taught us by Beccaria: without sanctions, without the threat of sanctions, it is difficult for any legal principles to be respected."
"Mr President, I believe that the merit of this regulation – and of the European Institutions that have contributed to its achievement – lies in having again overcome certain national concerns and egoistic considerations."
"A European Single Sky from 1 January 2005 will provide clear confirmation that Europe is growing, that the process of integration is developing and that that process is also synonymous with the quality and safety of our lives."
". – Mr President, as the elections approach, I am increasingly being asked whether Parliament actually amounts to anything, and whether it really does have anything to say."
"I think that this dossier is a case in point, and I shall discuss this in more detail."
"The Council and the Commission initially had very great ambitions, particularly after 11 September, but these gradually evaporated."
"There were all kinds of sensitivities regarding sovereignty and legal hurdles; in short, the Council did not dare to make a bold move, and Parliament clearly took a different perspective."
"We have a clear aim, which is increased integration in European airspace in the interests of the citizen."
"That is necessary, and, in consultation with the Council, we finally obtained a clear commitment on their part to achieve that aim, too."
"This is a first step in the right direction."
"The main points that we agreed with the Council in conciliation were on the subject of implementation, of course."
"Service providers must comply with stringent requirements, and this compliance must be monitored. Conflicts of interests must be eliminated, and access to services must be guaranteed for all airspace users: including military, I should like to add."
"I think that it is important for that to be pursued by the European Parliament."
"We also reached agreement on the charging regimes."
"Incentives can be used to promote a better use of airspace."
"There must be a decrease in subsidies, and, furthermore, everything must be made more transparent."
"We have also pushed for clarity as regards the future."
"When shall we see legislation regarding the licensing of air-traffic controllers?"
"At what point might the concepts of the Single Sky in the upper airspace also be applicable to lower airspace?"
"We should like some certainty on those points."
"In addition, we think it is a good thing that Eurocontrol has become involved with this; it has worked very hard on this, and indeed I believe that the discussion on this dossier has focused everyone’s attention, which is all to the good."
"The second point on which there was a difference of opinion was, of course, civil-military cooperation."
"I think Mr Fava’s greatest achievement was to succeed in securing the inclusion in the text of a clear reference to the need for this kind of cooperation."
"Parliament is committed to this, and emphasised it continually in the course of the negotiations."
"Indeed, this could perhaps be a stepping-stone to more and better military cooperation in the future."
"We in this House also succeeded in making clear the importance of data exchange; again, that applies to all – including military – service providers."
"We are also pleased that the Member States have committed themselves to cooperating on the concept of the flexible use of airspace across national borders: that will prevent many delays."
"Mr Fava has already discussed this in detail."
"Finally, there is the point on which conciliation nearly foundered: cross-border airspace blocks."
"I think that we have reached a reasonable compromise in the form of Article 5(6)."
"Speaking personally, I think this was one of the most important points, because, if progress is to be made, provision for conflict mediation has to be included in the text, otherwise it is all too easy to hide behind someone else."
"Having invested a great deal of effort in this on behalf of my colleagues, I am fairly pleased with the outcome."
"The Member States are obliged to take the views of the Commission into consideration, and they must also take those views as the basis for resolving conflicts over the creation of cross-border airspace blocks."
"What helped win us over was the Commission’s pledge, in the form of a written statement, to take action to review the procedure after five years if no clear progress has been made with the reorganisation of the airspace."
"This provides the impetus that is vital in order to make European airspace safer and more efficient."
"This is important for service providers, airspace users, and, of course, passengers."
"It is also essential in view of the current increase in air traffic of more than 2% per annum."
"Commissioner, you can be assured that the European Parliament has acted in the interests of the citizen and that we shall closely monitor the progress made and take action if the Member States are found wanting."
"It only remains for me to thank my colleagues for their excellent cooperation and the services for their support."
"Negotiations with the Council may well have been tough, but they were also congenial and constructive throughout, with each party understanding the other’s views; and that is the way it should be, too."
"It has been an honour to do my share towards making air transport safer and more efficient in the interests of the citizen."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to point out how important the role of the European Parliament has been, because I think that, together with the Council, we have achieved a very good proposal."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can imagine, today is an important day for me."
"It is a pleasure to be able to attend this debate which is going to represent the positive conclusion and therefore the approval of what has been one of this Commission’s priorities and, of course, one of my priorities, as Commissioner responsible for transport: the implementation of the Single European Sky."
"The work we have been doing has been hard and complicated, and we have therefore been working for some years."
"In relation to this initiative, for the first time, dressed in uniform, military aviation chiefs from all the Member States of the Union, together with civilian chiefs, met on the premises of the European institutions – and specifically the Commission’s premises – in order to discuss certain aspects which have been pointed out by the rapporteurs, such as the flexible civilian and military use of European airspace."
"It is an initiative for which the support of Parliament, and in particular that of Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has been the key to being able to promote it and bring it to light."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political groups and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their support during the many discussions we have held."
"I would like to point out that an initiative which, at the time we launched it, met with great scepticism from the Member States of the Union, which was fiercely opposed by certain sectors, is in the end going to enjoy generalised support."
"We must remember that all the Member States support this initiative and they demonstrated this with the adoption of the latest decisions within the Council, and I hope that in today’s vote this will also be the case."
"I would also point out that the various sectors of the industry in question (air navigation service providers, airlines, manufacturers of equipment, airports ...) are aware of the opportunity offered by this initiative, an opportunity to promote a market with greater dimensions, greater capacities and, above all, which is going to allow us to be leaders and work on the definition of new concepts of air navigation and air traffic control with a view to the STAR 21 initiative for 2020 and also participate, cooperate and combine proposals with those of the United States in order to promote a safer system."
"Mr Fava insisted on the safety aspect, which is a key element of this initiative, safer systems for the future but with a more appropriate technology which allows better, safer and more efficient use of the airspace and I would insist that all of this is going to lead to greater safety."
"I would like to say something which is also extremely important, and that is that the unions, in particular those which represent the key actors in this field, such as air traffic controllers, have in the end been appreciating the advantages of an initiative of this type and in this regard I am pleased with the joint statement which unions and employers have issued on the final text agreed, a final text within which Eurocontrol one of the key elements which was involved in the discussion also finds its role and responsibility as a body with experience and knowledge which is absolutely essential to the development of the Single European Sky."
"I am aware that some people have doubted the willingness of the States in relation to specific aspects and, just today, the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has indicated that we are going to closely monitor how the States of the Union develop in terms of the implementation of this Single European Sky."
"I believe that the text we have finally agreed on is a balanced text, a balanced text which will certainly evolve in the future, but we must be aware that we are carrying out a genuine revolution and an extremely important step forward in the construction of Europe in a real sense."
"The notion that there is sovereignty over airspace, an area in which we are going to regulate and act according to common rules within an integrated system is a tremendous step forward which we cannot underestimate, and therefore, the fact that the Member States maintain – as reflected in the text which we have finally agreed on – the guarantees necessary to accept this change, seems to me to be the appropriate compensation if we want to continue taking steps forward in the knowledge that Europe cannot be built in one day, but that it is a process within which we must continue to make progress on the basis of consensus with the support of all the States, because it is not a question of leaving anybody behind."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I know there are still things to do – and I would insist: over the coming years there will be new proposals – but I believe that today we are opening up new possibilities which mean taking maximum advantage of the prospects offered by our very membership of this group known as the European Union, in other words, taking advantage of European added value."
"And that is what we are doing today in order to create an airspace which can be managed more efficiently but, above all, more safely, in a manner which respects the environment, at the service of the citizens, and which represents, I would insist, a step forward which, in certain respects, is almost revolutionary."
"I would like to thank the Council for its position which has allowed us to develop in this way throughout these discussions over all these years – the first meeting took place in January 2000, it was one of the first things I did – four years during which we have all been able to develop and come together in relation to rules which allow us to introduce this initiative which, I would remind the honourable Members, will also affect Swiss airspace and Norwegian airspace."
"Furthermore, Switzerland and Norway have participated fully in the discussions we have held over all this time and, once again, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all the Members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Parliament and the Council for their contributions which have undoubtedly improved the final result."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really does matter a great deal to me that I should start by thanking both the rapporteurs, Mr Fava and also Mrs Sanders-ten Holte."
"I think they have fought splendidly and with commitment, particularly in the final stage, when one sometimes got the impression that only Parliament was left to carry on the fight on this issue, the Commission having thrown in the towel a while back."
"According to the splendid brochure that was issued in 2002 with a foreword by the Commissioner, ‘the time is ripe’."
"Then along came the many proposals that, alas, never seem quite to have taken legal effect."
"It is for that reason that I am a bit wary today of talking in terms of a historic moment or of a culmination."
"This is at best a start."
"Let us have no illusions; this is the third time that this House has discussed this topic, and if the public could listen in, they would find it utterly beyond belief, believing as they do that this ought to have been sorted out ages ago."
"On the ground, we have no borders any more; I can get in the car and drive from Berlin to Paris or from Paris to Rome without undergoing checks."
"Despite the compelling arguments in favour of its doing so, this situation does not, however, apply in the skies above us, where aircraft fly over borders on a day-to day basis."
"What is so comic about all this is the lamentable fact that the Council, in March 2002, when it met in Barcelona, came out with an explicit statement, noted a need, and made a demand to the effect that ‘we need a single European sky’, and it was the Council that stonewalled wherever it could, right up to the very end."
"I put this in such blunt terms simply because I have for a long time been considering whether I can at all vote in favour of the conciliation procedure."
"As we saw it, there were two central points, the two big issues. We wanted greater safety, and we wanted more efficiency in the air."
"We were aware that the two were closely interconnected, and that, on the one hand, collaboration and cooperation between civil and military aviation had to be organised, whilst, on the other, we must put an end to fragmentation once and for all. As the brochure so splendidly put it, the patchwork had to become a network."
"As Mr Fava put it, the fact that there are 41 air traffic control centres in the Member States alone, with a short flight from Brussels to Rome having to pass through seven of them, not only makes for potential dangers, but also provides reasons for unnecessary delays."
"The Council has spent a long time blocking these central points."
"I regret having to tell you, Commissioner, that, when the Common Position came back to the committee, it was your representatives who said that the Council may well have taken a conservative position, but that was the only big success we were going to get."
"If Parliament had not stood so firm, and if the two rapporteurs had not given their all, it would not have been possible to achieve what is at least a beginning, with some degree of cooperation, an agreement, an understanding, a shared conversation between all the users."
"Nor, moreover, would there have been the clear instruction to the Member States – who, let us recall, have had decades in which to create functional airspace blocks – combined with the declaration, which I saw as crucial, that if nothing changes in the next five years, we must and will make improvements, in which event we cannot allow the Member States to retain competence in this matter."
"With this in mind – for this was what I saw as essential – I said it would be better to have a bird in the hand at the moment and to make a start, for there was nothing else on offer."
"Let me make it quite clear, though, that I have not lost sight of the two birds in the bush, and I would ask that all of us in this European Parliament should continue to keep on working hard so that this single airspace in Europe should not be merely a vision, but should indeed, one day, become reality."
"We need it – whether we get it with the Member States or despite them."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work he has done and for his good cooperation."
"Commissioner, you once shared with us a vision of how we would in future be able to fly directly from A to B within Europe, thus enabling much better use to be made of capacity, reducing delays to a marked degree, radically minimising safety risks by, in short order, creating a few functional airspace blocks in Europe, and putting an end to the patchwork in the skies above Europe."
"What we have ended up with is a sort of ‘Single Sky ’."
"Politically speaking, it is clear, nothing more could be achieved, and agreement between the Council and Parliament was reached only at the very last minute – quite literally, at five minutes to twelve."
"As it is the overall result that matters to us, Parliament has moved a long way and has acceded to many of the Council’s wishes and concerns."
"It has to be said that the Council of Ministers gave us the distinct impression that the national point of view continued to predominate – and that impression remains."
"The result is that we have flown in the right direction but have landed well short of the runway."
"Particularly where military-civilian cooperation is concerned, Parliament had to be very careful of national sensitivities and was in fact obliged to abandon the concept of flexible use of airspace."
"Substantial areas of airspace continue to be barred to any but military traffic."
"While a direct flight from Rome to Brussels has presented no problems in navigational terms for some time now, it will not be possible in future, which is economic and environmental nonsense."
"We have in any case made progress in that the Member States have, for the first time, acknowledged that the only way to ensure the safe and efficient use of airspace is for the military and civilian users of it to cooperate, irrespective of how this is to be arranged in future."
"I cannot, though, do other than agree with Mr Fava when I say that, as regards the functional airspace blocks, which are at the heart of the Single Sky, the result was less than what the facts of the situation demanded, for a real Community solution would have been needed, with the Commission having clear decision-making competence."
"That, unfortunately, is something we could not get accepted; here too, the Member States still have the last word, but decisive progress has been made in that they are, for the first time, obliged to negotiate about the establishment of cross-border airspace blocks."
"Moreover, the Commission is to closely monitor developments, review the situation after five years and propose any changes that may be needed to the system; like Mr Schmitt, I hope that it will."
"To put it in plain language, the Member States can no longer evade their responsibilities, as they did over past decades, now that they are under close observation, and both Parliament and the Commission expect great things of them."
"To sum up, the outcome may well not be the quantum leap in air transport that we had hoped for and that had been heralded, but we have started to stake out the ground and can look forward to more Europe above the clouds in the future."
"Turning to the integration of lower airspace that is being contemplated and – if I may go one step further – the creation of a single trans-European airspace, I hope that the topic of flexible airspace use and, of course, of functional airspace blocks can again ..."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed regulations being put to the vote today are the result of an agreement made in conciliation following months of debate and work."
"On behalf of my group, I abstained on this agreement, but I support the steps forward made from the initial draft."
"Firstly, after various air disasters, the issue of safety remains the priority for any approach in this field."
"Therefore, from the start I looked at these reports mainly from the point of view of safety."
"I had expressed my regret in this House regarding the ideological bias that was placing liberalisation at the heart of the measures proposed."
"It was a bias that was aiming to make economic issues the regulator for air activity and the main method of improving things."
"In my view, the agreement reached now has a much more realistic approach."
"Cooperation between civilian and military air traffic will be promoted, insofar as it is compatible with the sovereignty of the Member States, even though I would have hoped for a more dynamic approach in this area."
"The airspace blocks will be based on operational or functional requirements, irrespective of national borders, in consultation with Eurocontrol."
"In the event of a dispute, the Member States will, if they wish, be able to jointly request the opinion of a Single Sky Committee, the body responsible for implementing the plan."
"Chaired by the representative of the Commission, this committee will be made up of two representatives of each Member State and a representative of Eurocontrol."
"The agreement allows the Member States the freedom to entrust air monitoring to a public service or a private company."
"I see these proposals as positive developments."
"Although there is not the initial plan to dismantle the chain of so-called ancillary services, I nevertheless regret the fact that it was not more clearly recognised that the management of air navigation safety is a chain of actions and services that requires a global approach rather than a piecemeal one."
"I still regret the fact that Parliament did not wish to retain the amendment that I had tabled on behalf of my group aimed at doubling monitoring mechanisms in order to ensure that operations continue in complete security in the event of a fault."
"I still think that the absolute rule of obligatory separation of functions between the service providers and the national monitoring authorities does not necessarily take into account the complex realities of decisions in sectors that are so inter-related."
"I also think that the issue of air traffic control and of everything involved with the regulation and safety of air traffic are tasks that are the responsibility of the public authorities, who should be considered as public services."
"I have met the operators."
"I have worked a great deal with the unions on this matter."
"I wish to thank them and say that their contributions counted towards the positive progress that we have made."
"I also think that in the future, the points of view of the main people involved, the employees, should be better taken into account."
"This is one of the conditions necessary in order for other improvements to be made and also for the measures that will be taken in Europe to be effective."
"You can be sure that my group is determined to contribute to this."
"This is the reasoning for my vote, aiming to both take into account the progress made and show how much there is left to do."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, my congratulations and thanks to both the rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte."
"I should also like to thank them for their dedication to bringing common interests to the fore."
"It is clear, after all, that the whole political spectrum in this House advocates greater European powers in order to better guarantee safety."
"I think that our national governments will have to be accountable."
"If an accident should happen, this would be owing to our continuing strong adherence to national lines, and so countries would have to answer to their own citizens regarding the lack of a genuine Single Sky."
"We often parade the principle of subsidiarity, of which I am a great supporter, but that subsidiarity must also apply from the bottom up."
"If this is necessary for the sake of the safety of air transport, the national authorities must be prepared to hand over power to the European Union."
"Anything else would be irresponsible."
"I recently had a conversation with the federal authorities of the United States, where no fewer than 48 000 people are engaged in monitoring air transport safety under a single federal umbrella."
"In my opinion, the degree of safety must not be subordinate to our great predilection for diversity."
"If there is one place where diversity should not apply, that is in matters of safety monitoring."
"For that reason, we agree with you that we are taking a step forward with the Single Sky today, but we could actually have taken this step as long as 20 years ago, and we should have been able to go much further today than we have now gone."
"Naturally, we are not blind to the improvements that have been made in the arrangements discussed during the negotiations."
"Nevertheless, we should like to emphasise that accidents of this kind, such as the one near Lake Constance, give us a further impetus to go over to those cross-borderairspace blocks, in order to preclude the possibility of even more accidents of this kind occurring as a result of poor communications."
"All in all, the improvement that we have here is still insufficient."
"After all, if we look at the way in which the civilian and military spheres are already cooperating on interoperability to a certain degree for the benefit of safety, we see that the concept of national sovereignty is invoked much too often there, and that could be detrimental to safety."
"That is a priority for this entire Parliament."
"Mr President, again today I think that numerous honourable Members are not particularly satisfied within themselves with the agreement which we have before us."
"I understand the reasons for their reactions; however, if they themselves go back a bit, six or seven years back, and look at where we were then, they will see that we have before us a very important step, a very important step for Europe, a very important step for the European citizens."
"As you too, Mr President, were personally involved in the conciliation procedure, you will understand, I think, better than anyone, that a very important step is being taken in the field of restricting delays and, consequently, in this manner we are strengthening air transport, protecting the environment better and efficiently supporting European tourism."
"Right until the end, we were faced with prejudices either on the part of certain Member States or certain military authorities."
"You know that, up to the last minute, there was a problem as regards cooperation between military and civil authorities, on the one hand, and there was a problem as regards the way in which single operating sections or blocks are defined at international level."
"Some steps were taken under pressure from the European Parliament."
"Perhaps the steps were not taken which should have been taken."
"Nonetheless, it is better for the European Parliament to agree to what we have before us and to look on it as a first step."
"Our efforts must not stop here."
"It is worth our putting even greater pressure on the Member States to become more bold in their approach and, I think, to close my short position, within these frameworks, it would be an oversight if we failed to mention the exceptionally positive role of the European Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, for whom I imagine it is perhaps one of the greatest achievements which she has had in her term of office to date as the Commissioner responsible for transport."
"We must thank her and congratulate her on that."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner and our rapporteurs for their tenacity on a very important subject."
"I would simply like to say that, as we saw with the Lake Constance disaster, the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster and those of the and the , whenever there is an accident people look to Europe."
"And generally speaking the very people who are against European integration forget they were against it when tragedies happen."
"I therefore believe that the creation of the single sky bodes well for the future."
"At any rate, in this integrated European area we ought to do for the sky what we have done for roads and what we are trying to do for shipping and the railways."
"I believe that in this matter Parliament’s role was quite decisive in getting the general interest and public service nature of air traffic control recognised."
"Conversely, I think that air traffic control personnel have gained a European dimension that will make them think differently in future and probably play a more active part in the next stages of the single European sky."
"I am pleased about all that and I think this text is at last integrated and that this evening we have good reason to be pleased with the result we have achieved."
"Mr President, you claim to be achieving what you call the single European sky, but even the small amount of progress made to overcome the divisions and rivalries between states, which are particularly absurd in the field of aviation, are more than offset by the increased competition between private airlines, and even air traffic control is handed over to the race for private profit."
"Behind the term ‘single sky’ is the race to privatise the old national carriers."
"This policy has already resulted in thousands of redundancies in the aeronautical sector."
"At this very moment, massive redundancies have been announced or are under way at Alitalia, at KLM, which is controlled by Air France, and in other large airlines."
"It is obvious what the privatised airlines’ shareholders have to gain from the reduction in personnel, not only flight staff, but also those involved in maintenance and safety checks."
"But this profit-driven approach means that passengers are running growing risks."
"To continue with this policy after the Lake Constance disaster 18 months ago, which was a direct consequence of the privatisation of air traffic control in Switzerland, is criminal."
"As for the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster, even if the precise technical cause is not yet known, everyone knows that the airlines, including the one that owned that aircraft, make their profits by turning their aircraft round more quickly, extending their flying time, taking on staff who are less well paid and often not trained well enough or by cutting maintenance and technical inspections to the mandatory minimum."
"Even the major airlines are doing the same, hounded by the competition."
"The quest for profit is not compatible with the quest for safety."
"We will vote for the amendments aimed at improving safety, but we are against every aspect of a policy that is based on competition, whether or not regulated at European level, because it will create an enormous mess and can only end in disaster."
"– Mr President, I too would like to join in the expressions of gratitude to you, Madam Vice-President, for the idea for the Single Sky was yours."
"You succeeded in getting it through the high-level group and in laying to rest many misgivings at national level, and, although Mr Schmitt is right to criticise what has emerged from the conciliation procedure, we do all agree that the system has undergone fundamental change."
"It formerly consisted of cooperation under Eurocontrol, but under Eurocontrol alone."
"The Member States were sovereign, there was no Community law, and each and every state could escape scrutiny by insisting on its own sovereignty."
"With this legislation, we now have a Community law that nobody can evade, one that can be adopted and amended by a majority, and the Commission’s role as guardian and administrator of Community law means that no Member State can admit that it is doing something not quite right in its own airspace control and safety measures, while asserting that it is no business whatever of the Commission’s."
"On the contrary, there is a manifest sharing of responsibility, and the Commission is at the heart of the implementation of the new law."
"I see this as a very great step forward, and one that is very much to be welcomed."
"As a result, I believe, we will be able to reduce waiting times in the air and at airports, and this will be to the benefit of passengers and airlines."
"We will be more successful on the environmental front, as every aircraft that spends too much time in parking orbit has a disastrous effect on our environment, and we will make progress in terms of safety, for fragmented technology and cooperation will be a thing of the past."
"Of course, I have to tell my socialist and post-communist friends that their belief that air navigation services must be provided by the public sector is one that I cannot go along with."
"If, though, we look back over recent years, let us ask ourselves where it was that service was always provided according to the book?"
"Where was it that aircraft were left hanging in the air?"
"The country that always occurs to my mind is one whose air navigation services are staffed by State officials, who do not necessarily make for better and more effective use of airspace."
"This, Commissioner, is something we need to discuss together as and when the opportunity arises."
"Following this legislative act, I believe, we will need – perhaps in two or three years’ time – a new initiative to introduce competition among air navigation services, where, as much as anywhere else, competition is required if performance is to be improved."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking our rapporteursand shadow rapporteursfor their work on this very detailed and complex report, which, of course, applies to upper air space."
"Further to the last Council common position – which my Delegation broadly supported – and the subsequent conciliation procedure, we are now able to fully support this regulation."
"During the process, one of our key objections concerned the inclusion of military operations and training."
"I am delighted that this sovereign competence is now excluded."
"Had it not been excluded there could have been an adverse impact on NATO operations, so I am also delighted that this is no longer the case."
"However, care needs to be taken during implementation that the newly-created bodies – i.e. the single sky committee and the industry consultation body – do not duplicate their efforts, thereby causing unnecessary confusion."
"It is quite clear that the aviation industry cannot continue to sustain the loss of USD 4 billion per year due to airspace congestion across Europe, and I believe that this regulation will go some way towards addressing this."
"Eurocontrol should also be congratulated for its initiative, put in place in January 2002, which introduced reduced vertical separation."
"I understand that we have increased capacity by some 30% and reduced delays to the levels we saw in 1998-1999."
"However, it does behove certain countries and areas, such as France, Italy, Spain, southern Germany and Switzerland, which are responsible for 44% of the delays, to make radical improvements nationally if this regulation is going to succeed."
"Another area which needs to be addressed urgently is the shortage of air-traffic controllers across Europe."
"In conclusion, with this regulation we should improve safety, efficiency and the economics of air traffic management, which, as air traffic across Europe continues to grow, is good news for the industry, for business and for the consumer."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, I would like to use these two minutes to praise the work of the rapporteurs, who have been so persistent and clear on a complex issue that is full of nuances, but who have never lost sight of, or abandoned, the main objective; to also praise every one of us, members of the committee, who have believed in their work and supported it; and to praise the Commission, which has worked alongside us and also allowed us all to achieve a result with which I can say that I am satisfied."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is not merely technical satisfaction."
"Some Members have already said that, on this issue, we could certainly have done more, we could have achieved more, we could have gone further in terms of the level of harmonisation, but I would invite you to reflect on the satisfaction that we must feel from a political point of view: we have, at any rate, succeeded in breaking a taboo, since from now on – and armed with a regulation for achieving it – we can talk about a single European sky; of course, not yet at the level that we want and hope for, but nonetheless on the basis of an actual situation of which good use has been made."
"There is even more reason to be satisfied because this provision belongs within a framework that has already brought other provisions to bear: I refer to the one, approved by the Council, on denied boarding, and the one – and I really hope that it will be adopted – that Mrs Maes is preparing on aircraft safety."
"I therefore believe that we must also be satisfied, because this is the Europe that the citizens understand best, the Europe that the citizens feel close to, because it is the Europe that increases their safety, enhances their rights and increases their satisfaction with the response to their expressed needs."
"I believe that the citizens will be our main allies when, on this issue too, we seek to progress and achieve the results which today are not within our reach but which we will certainly be able to achieve in the years to come."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my full and unconditional satisfaction with the result that has come out of the Conciliation Committee."
"I believe that the encouraging prospects that have been illustrated here are certainly more significant than the doubts raised by the debate in previous years in committee and within the Council and the Commission, and which have also been expressed here today."
"What I would like to stress – and in doing so I support what previous speakers said in their speeches – is the political aspect, as well as the emphasis being placed on defining this agreement as historic: we must not forget that it is the same emphasis which, ten years ago, we placed on abolishing territorial borders, which at the time seemed a miracle and which paved the way for real European integration."
"The agreement reached certainly represents a balanced compromise given the many difficulties and the selfishness of the various sectors which, quite rightly, set down their interests and competences."
"The result is, therefore, a result that is due to everyone, but I too would like to express my satisfaction that you, Commissioner de Palacio, focused on this objective with great tenacity, together with the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and also ourselves as members of the committee."
"The result is satisfactory."
"The new role of Eurocontrol and military and civil cooperation have been highlighted, but I would also like to stress the interoperability of the European air traffic control network and the issue, no less important – which you, Commissioner de Palacio, emphasised – of the certification of service providers."
"Similarly positive – the rapporteur Mr Fava mentioned this, and I would like to say that I completely agree with him – is the matter of sanctions for service providers and airlines that breach the provisions of the single sky, with safety objectives set, not just for the benefit of our European citizens but also for the benefit of all those who are to use, and fly in, the skies above Europe."
". Mr President, I believe we are all aware that today’s discussion marks the conclusion of an historic step forward in European integration."
"We have broken a taboo, according to Mr Lisi, and we would perhaps have liked to have gone even further and to have created more common ground, and I am sure that in the coming years there will be modifications to these two regulations, to this legislative package, with a view to improving it."
"Once the degree of trust increases, and the application and reality of the Single Sky becomes the norm, and we all see how we can combine the elements relating to the concepts of sovereignty and defence, which are present in airspace, with more appropriate, efficient and safer management of airspace within European civil aviation."
"In this regard, I would like in particular to thank the honourable Member, Mr President, because it is true – Mr Dimitrakopoulos – that your work during the conciliation procedure was key."
"Also key was the work, as I said a moment ago, of the two rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and all the people responsible within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I would like to say that for the Commission, and for me personally, this is one of the three great initiatives which I will always remember from my time in the European Commission."
"Then we are going to talk about another one, the GALILEO Programme, as soon as we finish this debate."
"With this initiative, together with GALILEO and certain others – perhaps maritime safety, despite the fact that some people do not yet see it like this – we have carried out a genuine revolution and we have changed the limits, the borders, of Europe."
"By means of this initiative we are Europeanising our airspace, which was previously not European."
"Through this initiative, we are truly creating a European airspace, we are creating a European sky, furthermore combining guarantees for States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am just going to make a brief comment: there are certain Members who say that on the whole issue of functional blocks there should be Community competence; , although it is not exactly the same, it is as if the Commission had full competences in relation to defining road routes or railway networks and in relation to constructing them."
"We must also take account of the will of the States."
"It cannot be done in a contradictory manner, the Commission must provide this European thinking and this European component which is perhaps not always present in the national view, but it is obvious that without the Member States we cannot carry out this kind of action."
"I would like to say that Eurocontrol, throughout these years, has also made very great progress."
"And I believe we have contributed something to these improvements because Eurocontrol is aware of the process and the impetus that exists and, in this regard, I am extremely pleased that we have been able to finally achieve full Community participation in Eurocontrol, which has been extremely important, as well as the organisation of its cooperation in the whole Single Sky process."
"I will end by saying just one thing: what the Commission has never done in relation to this initiative has been to throw in the towel."
"Some have perhaps done so at certain times, but the Commission, and myself personally, have not done so."
"As I have said, I began in January 2000, with a series of meetings in which civilian and military chiefs participated, when no progress had yet been made on defence aspects, though over recent years progress has been made."
"There was no COPS or anything like it but nevertheless they came and, I would insist, at that time, it was believed that our initiative was impossible."
"We have been able to separate the issues and resolve what could be resolved and not paralyse everything as a result of trying to resolve everything."
"Because we all know that one way to ensure that nothing happens is to try and achieve perfection overnight."
"I believe that what we have achieved today is very important, and that it is this very mixture of a vision of creating a European Single Sky and of realism, which has guided our action, both in Parliament and in the Commission, and also – I would like to point out – in the Council, which has allowed us to take pleasure today in a positive result, which is an extremely important step, which we all know will be followed by further steps, but which is the first step in this new frontier of the Single European Sky."
"Thank you, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, both for your statement and your kind words."
"The debate on this matter, on which we all worked very hard but with very positive intuition, is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (Α5-0003/2004) by Mr Piétrasanta, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the state of progress of the Galileo programme (COM(2002) 518 – 2003/2041(INI))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of this legislature a number of reports about Galileo have been made to the European Parliament in turn by Mrs Langenhagen, who is here today, Mr Glante, Mr Dhaene and myself."
"They were always presented positively, but nevertheless had to overcome many obstacles to get our European project adopted."
"It was criticised as duplicating the American GPS, but that made me think of the fable of the blind man and the paralytic."
"Were we expected to call on the United States to be our eyes and show us the way to go?"
"The cost was said to be ruinous, although it is about the same as building a little more than 100 km of high-speed railway line."
"Our wisdom finally carried the day and, concerned to implement the European Union’s strategy for employment, economic reform, research, and social cohesion decided by the Lisbon European Council in March 2002, we adopted Galileo."
"I have now been working for nearly a year on this report to bring us up to date on this project and on the integration of EGNOS into Galileo."
"However, the fear of a delay in implementation was such that we have been overtaken, and happily so, by the project being put in place and I am now in a position to present the excellent results that we achieved in 2003 and to make a number of recommendations for operational implementation in order to ensure that Galileo really does go into service by 2008 at the latest."
"I am therefore taking account here of two Commission communications."
"The first is concerned with the state of progress following the Council decision of 26 March 2002, which saw the informal adoption of the regulation creating the joint undertaking on 21 May 2002, and the second the integration of EGNOS into Galileo."
"The communication covers the following aspects: the creation of joint undertakings, which has now been done, the system’s security – on our recommendation the supervisory authority was created at the same time as the security centre; its role is vital because it ensures that Galileo will remain a project geared to its users’ wishes;"
"I believe Parliament should be more closely involved with this committee in a way that remains to be decided – service definition and frequency planning, the reservation of frequencies."
"The problem of the overlay of signals on the fifth service (or PRS) with the US army’s M signal has also been settled."
"The Commission and the United States have found a compromise."
"The Galileo signal will surround the US signal and will no longer be overlaid."
"Relations with third countries have been normalised."
"There are no problems with the Russian Glonass system."
"There is some cohabitation, or at least consultation, for the American GPS."
"And countries are joining us, like China, with whom a promising agreement, especially in the field of research, was initialled in Beijing on 18 September 2003."
"By way of reminder, Galileo is merely a giant clock consisting of around 30 satellites capable of determining a position in time and space very accurately."
"Unlike GPS and Glonass, it must remain a purely civilian project."
"The services it will provide are very important, especially in the environmental field."
"As a tool for protecting nature, it will help to track pollution by dangerous substances, track icebergs, and map the oceans and sea levels."
"It will help to monitor the atmosphere, the ionosphere, radio communications, space science and even to predict earthquakes or monitor endangered species."
"It will be possible to pinpoint dangerous substances such as nuclear waste at any time."
"We have not forgotten space pollution either, since we shall have to ensure that any new object launched into space can be neutralised."
"There will be many other developments in transport and communications."
"I would like to stress Galileo’s fundamental contribution as a spearhead for our European space policy, integrating more closely the roles of the Union and the ESA."
"And in the European Research Area, a large amount of funding is provided in the sixth research and development framework programme by the European Space Agency’s ARTES programme and the private partners."
"With a large part of the funding coming from the public purse, the results of the research and the intellectual property will belong to all the European Union’s citizens."
"So far as EGNOS is concerned, I propose that it be integrated into Galileo, through the good offices of the joint undertaking, because this satellite radio navigation system can only be based on our global system."
"Galileo is a very important achievement of our legislature."
"It was proposed and supported by the Council and the Commission, and I want to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio in transport and energy, to the Director-General Mr Lamoureux and also to Mr Busquin for their energy and determination in bringing it about."
"I also want to thank all my fellow Members for the constant interest they have shown in Galileo, especially those on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Galileo is a fine European Union project."
"First and foremost, it will help to implement our policy of sustainable development with the ethics essential to an action of such breadth."
"Our Parliament can be proud to have been a driving force in the dynamic that our Assembly has shown and which will help to make the European Union more independent; it is a step towards a decision full of political significance and one very much called for by our draft Constitution."
". Mr President, I would like once again to thank the European Parliament for its support for the Commission in relation to moving ahead with the Galileo project."
"The Piétrasanta report is further evidence of this since it decisively approves the action we have carried out throughout this time and encourages us to move forward."
"I would like to thank you once again for your support and I would also like to thank Mr Piétrasanta in particular for his work."
"I would like to point out that at the moment, as you well know, the Galileo joint undertaking is fully operational and has been since the summer of 2003."
"Its two main tasks are, on the one hand, to select the future Galileo concessionaire we have four offers on the table which were received in December 2003 following the publication of an invitation to tender for concession last year and these four offers demonstrate the real interest of four consortiums in taking charge of this project and, therefore, clear interest in the private sector in the Galileo project."
"The second element we are working on is the monitoring of the work carried out by the European Space Agency on validation in orbit."
"A first experimental satellite will be launched before the end of 2005 and a second satellite will be ready to launch during the first half of 2006, because we must begin to transmit test signals, in order to guarantee that we maintain the signals which were granted us originally by the corresponding international body."
"With regard to relations with third States, which Mr Piétrasanta referred to a moment ago, what we are seeing is huge interest and this confirms once again that both the Commission and Parliament, which have never doubted the Galileo project, were right and those countries which had concerns or doubts and which for some time have had difficulties promoting the Galileo project, had no justifiable reason for it."
"We have in fact signed an agreement with China, the negotiation with India is at a very advanced stage, Brazil also wants to participate in the Galileo project, not to mention cooperation with Russia and, of course, the United States."
"With the United States, we have resolved practically all the compatibility problems with the GPS system by means of cooperation between systems which allows us to enhance and improve the signal and the corresponding services."
"In this regard, at the last meeting we held at the end of last year, practically all the issues were resolved, there is just one issue to be resolved on open signals and we are very close to resolving it and we hope that tomorrow and the next day, at our meeting in Washington, we can finally resolve the matter."
"I would therefore like to thank the honourable Member for his report, and Parliament for the very clear support it has given this Commission initiative throughout all this time, since we have had to fight hard and at times overcome complex difficulties, but I would like to say that it is moving in the right direction."
"As I said a moment ago, with regard to these three projects: ‘Single Sky’ is under way, Galileo is well and truly launched, and ‘maritime safety’, which we has gone from nothing to a whole package which protects and supports us, not just in the European Union but at international level."
"Mr President, if I could only mention three, then these would be the three tasks which we will have achieved – and I say ‘we’ because we have achieved it amongst all of us – a team, a Commission team, and I would like once again to thank the services I have referred to, from the Director-General to all the people responsible who have acted and worked throughout this time but of course with the invaluable cooperation of this Parliament, which has given us support systematically and, of course in the end as well, the cooperation of the Council. If the Council is not there, then the system does not work; the Community triangle, once again."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we have just heard the USA declare that they want to make a massive commitment to space and again invest a great deal of money in it: settlements on the moon, a mission to Mars – pictures of which we see almost daily; this, I believe, is where Galileo is a very important and good sign for Europe’s economic and technological future."
"I am also looking ahead to this year’s European elections."
"People are always asking us in what ways Europe is benefiting them, and Galileo enables us to give them an example of how European forces can combine – for only together can we achieve such objectives – in the spheres of business and technology, in a useful way that benefits the future of the Europe in which we share."
"The problems have been described, and it is now urgently necessary that we make headway on the problems with implementation, including the ones that involve the Americans."
"A large number of obstacles have been overcome."
"Parliament has been constant in its support for the Commission, the Council has played its part, and now is the time to decide on the tenders. We have to waste no time in installing the system, so that we can work with it, and we have to create the right framework conditions, especially in the structures."
"This is where I wish to address a point that I see as important."
"When deciding on the future structures of Galileo, which we will be debating in this House, it is necessary that these should be effective, but it is equally necessary that Parliament should retain its share of responsibility and not allow this dossier to be taken out of its hands."
"Although I would ask that, when we come to discuss this, we should perhaps get more support from the Commission, I think that we have, together, demonstrated that Europe, the European Parliament, is united in its pursuit of this objective."
"Commissioner, this House has always been behind you, so in this matter too, we should make common cause in seeing to it that responsibility remains with Parliament."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to extend special congratulations to Mr Piétrasanta, for he and I worked well together in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy; he was a sympathetic and agreeable colleague and was open to all his fellow-Members’ suggestions, misgivings and questions."
"In the course of our deliberations on this report, we had interesting hearings with experts, whom we were able to ask about their reports, and who had interesting things to say about Galileo’s future uses."
"Even though some of us had to allow ourselves a slight smile at some of the statements and prognoses, I see Galileo as a model for the future and believe that it will yield returns on what is invested in it, something that is apparent from the fact that there have already been four responses to the invitation to tender."
"I can remember how, some two years or so ago, things looked very different and there was often doubt as to whether industry would get on board financially."
"Now we are about to open the documents and announce the result."
"That is something I cannot but welcome."
"In fact, Mr Piétrasanta’s report contains everything that matters."
"There is one further thing I want to mention, on which I tabled amendments in the committee and will be tabling another for the plenary; I ask your indulgence, but it is one that matters especially to me."
"I refer to the rescue and aid services that are to be implemented."
"Although COSPAS-SARSAT is well-known, there is also the IMMARSAT-E system, which is preferable to COSPAS-SARSAT in many respects, such as its rapid response times, more precise positioning, permanent availability, 100% compatibility with Galileo, and coverage of the whole of the earth’s surface."
"This system is important to people in trouble at sea, as such information is highly detailed and help can arrive at very short notice."
"I think this is something to which we should give some thought; a number of organisations – some of them military, like NATO – and Member States are already fitting this system into their Transall transport aircraft, helicopters and naval vessels."
"I think it would also be helpful to private individuals, and the two systems can certainly exist alongside each other."
"I hope that we will implement this tomorrow and that Members will support the one amendment of mine that is still to be voted on."
"Thank you all, and I wish you, Mr Piétrasanta, all the best for the future; something lies in store for you and we will miss you."
"Mr President, in 2002 in Lisbon the European Council proposed the objective that within ten years the European Union should be the most dynamic and advanced economy in the world, generating employment, social protection and well-being for all the citizens."
"To this end, it was established that various economic reforms were necessary, as well as a strengthening of research and social cohesion, but nevertheless, in almost all the Member States we are seeing constant examples of relocation of companies whose owners, generally multinationals, are seeking greater profit margins by reducing the manufacturing costs of products, establishing their industries in countries with cheaper workforces and, sometimes, with fewer environmental controls."
"This creates unemployment in the Union and reduces our wealth and our capacity to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"In the face of this unstoppable dynamic caused by globalisation, our reaction must not be to try to compete in order to bring our costs into line with those offered by less developed countries, on the basis of sacrifices on the part of our workforce or of our environmental requirements."
"Our approach must be to strengthen our human resources, education, training, technological development, research and knowledge."
"Only in that way will we continue to maintain our competitive advantage and promote and retain cutting-edge companies and sustain the high level of social well-being, protection and cohesion we enjoy."
"The Galileo project, which we are debating today, is a good example of our taking the correct path."
"Together with the European Space Agency, the EGNOS programme, and hopefully also ITER, it creates a launch pad so that Europe can be in the leading group in terms of the most important challenges humanity is going to face during this twenty-first century, that is to say, taking advantage of our atmosphere and outer space in a manner which is sustainable and respectful of nature."
"And since the Earth and the universe belong to all of us, we fully support the idea of Galileo being open to cooperation with third countries such as China, India, Brazil and others, as well as the negotiations with Russia and the United States on satellite navigation."
"And also that our Galileo transponders be used to assist the existing maritime rescue systems and cover the needs of transport, telecommunications, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and, above all, people."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Piétrasanta on his report as well as the Commission, Parliament and finally also the Council, for promoting the Galileo project."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Piétrasanta, for his thorough work on the Galileo positioning system."
"Galileo has proved to be a tremendous success and I hold the view that it is vital for Europe to continue to invest in this key technology into the future."
"It is worth noting that, unlike competing global positioning systems – notably American ones – our Galileo project has been used exclusively for civilian purposes."
"I believe this must continue."
"I am not keen on seeing Galileo turned to military applications."
"Galileo can play a key role in helping the European Union achieve the competitiveness goals set in Lisbon, goals which form a key plank of the Irish presidency's programme."
"The future participation of China in Galileo through substantial financial investment in the programme is most welcome."
"I am convinced that we must go further in seeking international partners who will be pleased to find alternative options to the previous monopolies."
"In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the supervisory board called for by Parliament, has indeed been set up."
"This is an important contribution to transparency and accountability."
"– Mr President, we certainly agree with the rapporteur’s statement relating to the satellite system and a civil satellite system but I believe that we should not have too many illusions about the possibility of clearly separating civil and military purposes, above all in view of the military repercussions of civil technology; still less can we be under the illusion that civil and military purposes are separate in dictatorships such as China, which use precisely these civilian instruments designed to locate people as tools for widespread repression, made possible thanks to new technology, in particular new satellite technology."
"This is why I believe that the report should have expressed greater concern on this issue."
"We welcome the conclusion of negotiations with China regarding its participation in the Galileo system."
"In fact, the risks at military level are not theoretical risks, but those indicated by the European Commission as useful factors, from a European point of view, for its defence."
"I would like to quote from a document – a Commission position paper – of 31 December 2001 which stated that: ‘if the Galileo Programme is abandoned, we will in the next twenty or thirty years lose our autonomy in defence’;and again, on 12 March 2002: ‘although designed for civilian applications Galileo will also give the EU a military capability’, and the Directorate General indicated the usefulness of a separate Galileo signal to support the military aspect."
"In view of this clarification from the European Commission’s Directorate General regarding our technology; it is as well to know that this is also valid for China."
"The issue is not about sabotaging the Galileo system; it is explicitly about taking these risks into consideration and taking adequate measures – involving regulations, procedures and, if necessary, sanctions – to prevent these technological repercussions, which are in part unavoidable and only natural, from going beyond what is acceptable."
"Otherwise, there will be nothing for it but to imagine that the speed and ease with which the agreement with China was reached is part of the European Union’s larger political strategy."
"I apologise for digressing and implicating the government of the rapporteur’s country, but I believe that the attitude that we have seen recently from President Chiracand Prime Minister Villepin regarding the Chinese communist regime is a worrying sign of a very precise strategic and political direction."
"If adequate countermeasures are not taken, there is a genuine risk of very real technological repercussions over the next few years for the army of a country that is antidemocratic, illiberal and a dictatorship and that knows how to turn secret services and specifically civil espionage to military use, something that our own intelligence organisations are, in any case, also doing."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, when we have something to say, we prefer to do so without delay."
"For that reason, I would really have liked us to have discussed the state of play on Galileo some time ago, and would also have liked to see more regular follow-up."
"The 2002 Commission communication has now, in 2004, been rendered obsolete by developments in the programme."
"We cannot carry on being so slow in the way we handle current information, for I fear that any delay in Galileo’s development will make for serious problems if it is to be launched, as planned, in 2008."
"Negotiations on the award of concessions must be completed without delay."
"Galileo is still running on schedule, but we have to ensure that it stays on it, albeit without detriment to the necessary care in examining the tenders submitted."
"We have to press on with the procedure and, of course, get the maximum use out of Galileo."
"Only then will we be able to be convincing on the international stage."
"In this respect, the signing of the EU’s agreement with China on the latter’s involvement in Galileo was a very important step, and others must follow."
"The fact that the Council has now mandated the Commission to start negotiating with Israel and India in February shows that we are making good progress by way of bilateral agreements, but it is also of great importance, as has been described in relation to the USA, that we should find a shared basis for cooperation."
"In this regard, making Galileo interoperable with GPS is a challenge we have to deal with, and both sides must make greater efforts."
"Recently, there have been major forward advances across the board, and I would like it if future developments were to justify the great confidence placed in Galileo around the world."
"Let me close by saying this: Commissioner de Palacio, you are right."
"We wish you a great deal more success in Washington, but also elsewhere, and Mr Piétrasanta also takes our best wishes with him as he embarks on his further career in politics."
"I would like to begin by expressing my delight at the maturity of this Galileo dossier, which will remain one of the great achievements of this legislature and an example of what the Commission and Parliament can do together, to the general incredulity and despite the resistance of many Member States."
"I believe this work does us all credit and I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Loyola de Palacio."
"I believe this Galileo is something with a real future for Europe, firstly because of its many potential applications in a large number of services that will benefit our fellow citizens, secondly because it maintains our competence, and especially our independence, in space matters, and lastly because it will provide work for our launchers, which we know are a weak sector in a world where launchers are very exposed to competition."
"Two problems remain, however, I believe."
"First, there is the problem of funding for the operational phase."
"I still do not understand in what way and how the private sector will be able to involve itself in the infrastructure competitively with a GPS that will provide its services free of charge."
"From this point of view it will therefore either ask for guaranteed resources or it will seek something in return."
"I think we must be very careful here."
"I have always thought that infrastructure should be public and that services should be paid for by those that use them."
"But I will wait and see what the funding plan will be, which I think should be settled as quickly as possible."
"Then in the matter of international cooperation – and on this point I agree with Mr Cappato to some extent – I think it is good that China is interested, but not at any price."
"Firstly, let us make sure that China does not demand that satellites be launched by its own launchers at the expense of Ariane, which needs an institutional market, and secondly, let us ensure that China, which is not a democratic state, does not use it for military purposes, which would be contrary to our essential values and in particular the respect for human rights which we know not to be the Chinese Government’s greatest virtue."
"– Mr President, my thanks go to my colleague, Mr Piétrasanta, for the work he has done just as he is about to retire."
"Galileo will bring a good deal of direct benefits, such as the EGNOS navigation system, due to make its appearance this spring."
"It will provide industry with economic benefits and will bring to the navigation sector the competition it has long needed."
"We would be able to combine the use of the GPS system, Galileo and the Glonass system."
"I wish now, however, to stress the importance of Galileo’s later potential applications, especially in trans-European satellite-based broadband communication systems."
"When used in combination with a global positioning function it will make possible many new options in the economy which now we can only dream of."
"Economically speaking, it is the most effective way to bring broadband within the reach of all Europeans regardless of where they live and without discrimination."
"Broadband can give the telecommunications industry the extra boost it needs to compete globally."
"Finally, although I have mainly mentioned here the economic potential for supporting the Lisbon strategy, I would also like to emphasise the massive benefits Galileo will have for search and rescue services and transport."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you once again."
"As was said a moment ago, there have been difficult and hard times."
"I remember, for example, that at one point there was a collection of signatures of Members of this Parliament expressing support for a continuation of the Galileo Programme and calling on the Council to take positive decisions once and for all."
"I would therefore like to insist that if this is one of the great achievements of this legislature, it is because of what it means in terms of enhancing the role of the European Union at international level, our autonomy and our very sovereignty, our future capacities, without leaving any field of technological development out of our ambitions."
"I believe we have achieved this amongst all of us and there have certainly been really difficult times."
"I would like to respond very briefly to certain issues which have been raised."
"The issue of China and human rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely concerned about the issue of human rights in China, and not only China, since there are unfortunately problems in other countries which are closer than China."
"The European Union must not back down and must systematically ensure that the importance of human rights is respected."
"What we have is an agreement for participation in the project, with certain limits, with certain elements, but I believe that the aspects pointed out by the honourable Members will of course have to be considered for the future and I believe them to be very important."
"The next question is whether Galileo is a private system."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, it is a public system, the property of the European Union."
"All there is is a concession for its management by a private company."
"But it must be made crystal clear that it is public, with public regulation and furthermore, as Mr Piétrasanta said quite rightly in his report, intellectual property rights and other things will benefit all the citizens of the various countries of the European Union."
"Why management by a private consortium and why payment services?"
"Why are there going to be payment services when there are free-of-charge services?"
"Because, as you are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, there are three levels, one of which is open, free and free-of-charge for any citizen, like GPS, but unlike GPS it is not subject to ups and downs since it is a civilian project rather than a military one."
"Secondly, there is a free entry level but by means of payment, and with that free entry by means of payment there will not only be better definition and greater precision in terms of the signal received, but also a quality certificate, in other words, it will be known at all times whether the greatest possible precision is really being provided, or if, on the other hand, there is any difficulty which is reducing it."
"This is fundamental for certain types of service, such as air navigation, for example."
"With this signal quality certification it will be possible to land, it will be possible to change air navigation systems, for example, and it will also be possible to land simply relying on a system such as Galileo."
"Thirdly, the final signal, as you know, is a security signal, closed to public use, intended exclusively for use by governments."
"I would finally like to thank Parliament once again – and also the Council, for the position it finally took – and all the services of the Commission, and Mr Piétrasanta for his work and his cooperation, and wish him luck in his new duties and congratulate on being lucky enough to mark his final plenary session with such an important and symbolic report for the future of Europe, such as this Galileo Programme."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"The next item is the joint debate on public sector contracts:"
"- Report (A5-0007/2004) by Stefano Zappalà on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts (PE-CONS 3696/03 C5-0607/2003 2000/0115(COD))"
"and"
"- Report (A5-0008/2004) by Stefano Zappalà, on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal service sectors (PE-CONS 3695/03 C5-0608/2003 2000/0117(COD))."
"Mr President, the European Union delivers."
"The effectiveness of the codecision procedure has made a substantial contribution in this case."
"People’s demands for development, increased growth and more jobs have now met with a response."
"The conciliation concerning public procurement, which we are now to debate, is an expression of this."
"It is necessary to modernise the European market and open it to public procurement in order to increase European competitiveness."
"The directive on public procurement stipulates full competition between tenderers."
"Complete transparency and equal treatment are guaranteed."
"That is of benefit both to European taxpayers, who obtain better value for money, and to the innumerable companies that are now being given the opportunity to compete for contracts throughout the EU."
"From Parliament’s point of view, the conciliation was a success."
"There were few of us who, at the beginning, had believed that the final outcome would be so close to our starting position."
"The administration of procurement will be considerably simplified."
"The directive will be simpler and clearer than its predecessor, and there will be increased user-friendliness, especially as a result of the electronic trading centres that are to be established, a development that will simplify matters for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited administrative resources."
"Improved dialogue between suppliers and those who issue contracts has been built into the directive."
"Our aim was to increase competitiveness, to promote equal treatment and to improve our tools for combating organised crime and corruption."
"It was necessary to increase transparency and, in particular, information about who has obtained a contract and why."
"It was these issues and the opportunity of introducing social and environmental considerations that, more than anything else, forced the conciliation."
"The directive prevents social and environmental aspects being taken account of in an arbitrary or unbalanced way. Thought can, however, still be given to such matters."
"We obtained a balance with the aid of the EC Court of Justice’s jurisdiction, whose case law was implemented, a factor that provides legal certainty in this area."
"For this encouraging outcome, I wish especially to thank both the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, and the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Berger, whose input has been considerable."
"I also especially wish to thank both the entire parliamentary delegation and the two Commissioners who are present today and who, to use a homely turn of phrase, have not let the grass grow under their feet but really have made major practical contributions."
"I even wish, unusually for an MEP, to thank the Presidency, which dealt with this issue and with which we negotiated."
"Without all these combined efforts, it would have been impossible to take this step."
"We should not have been able to come so far if all the parties had not had the practical political will to deliver to Europe in this area."
"The outcome, therefore, was agreement, in spite of quite difficult political antagonisms at the start."
"We expect this step to contribute to more intensive European trade, the consequence being gains in terms of prosperity for the EU, our citizens and our European populations."
"Thank you, all who have contributed."
"C. Mr President, we are today on the verge of adopting the most comprehensive reform of EU public procurement law since the set up of the internal market."
"It simplifies and modernises our legislation and gives to the public sector and to industry the means to cut costs and enhance competitiveness."
"The importance of this piece of legislation for reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy is remarkable."
"Indeed, public procurement is an important part of the internal market, not only because of its volume – for 2002 public procurement amounted to approximately EUR 1500 billion: more than 16% of GDP or, in other words, more than half of the German GDP – but also because of the great potential for further savings for European citizens and taxpayers."
"A recent draft report on the functioning of public procurement markets in the EU shows that the procurement directives have contributed to increased transparency in public procurement markets."
"The new evidence, based on a sample of firms and public authorities, suggests that increased transparency has effectively resulted in more cross-border competition, price convergence and lower prices for goods and services purchased by public authorities."
"Most importantly, this evidence shows that economic reforms work and pay off."
"So much so, that the report strongly suggests that further savings are possible in this area."
"Case studies show that savings of the order of 12% could have been made over the period 1998–2002."
"The potential importance of this is quite remarkable: if savings of 10% could be made, then 5 countries would turn their budget deficits into surpluses and no eurozone Member State would run a public sector deficit that would break the Stability and Growth Pact's 3% limit!"
"This is quite remarkable."
"Of course, the report recognises that problems, such as transaction costs, remain."
"To address such problems, the legislative package in front of you will help with e-procurement, offering new possibilities for cost reductions."
"If promptly adopted and effectively implemented by Member States, these measures will contribute to further improve the performance of our public procurement markets."
"However important the economic aspects of public procurement may be, they should not be our exclusive focus – other major policies in the social and environmental fields also need to be considered."
"In this context I would like to compliment the Conciliation Committee – and Mrs Cederschiöld – for their excellent work in reaching a well-balanced compromise which fully consolidates and safeguards the advances made by the current jurisprudence as regards the possibilities of using environmental and social award criteria."
"Furthermore, as Mrs Cederschiöld said, I would like to emphasise the convergence between this solution and the latest Court of Justice ruling of 4 December 2003 – two days after the Conciliation Committee meeting – which confirmed the four conditions agreed upon in conciliation that are to be fulfilled by award criteria in order to be valid."
"Provided these conditions are met, production methods could be used as award criteria without being mentioned explicitly."
"Award criteria such as those dealt with in the recent judgment of 4 December will continue to be possible and will, furthermore, be based on clearer legal texts."
"This confirms one of the merits of this legislative package, namely that the general clarification and simplification of the legislation will lead to more legal certainty."
"Finally I would like to address the situation of certain professions with key roles to play in ensuring high quality when procuring."
"In this respect, the legislative package will – thanks to the extensive work of the rapporteur – recognise this role and take the particular, qualitative aspects of such services into better account."
"For all these reasons, I appeal to the Members of this House to support the results of this conciliation process and finally to adopt this important piece of legislation."
"Once again, I should like to thank all Members who have contributed to the excellent outcome of the various debates held on this important matter."
"– Mr President, the importance of this directive has already been emphasised by those who have spoken before me, but in recent years it has been frequently highlighted and reflected upon specifically in order to achieve a result like the one that we have obtained."
"I will not, therefore, dwell on the importance or the content of the directive, which have already been the subject of many meetings and many debates."
"I would merely like to quickly take the opportunity to make two remarks: the first is to point out that this directive will enter into force just when enlargement takes place, making things run more smoothly not just for the 15 current Member States, but also for the 25 which will, in a few months’ time, be Members of our Union."
"I strongly welcome what Commissioner Bolkestein said as regards quality."
"I tried many times, as rapporteur, to stress the issue of quality above all."
"I know that the Commission is moving in this direction with other initiatives, and I therefore hope that, when a contract is awarded using the principle of the quality/price ratio, quality will always come out on top, above all in professional services."
"Having, as rapporteur, spent four years on this issue, together with many other Members, I would conclude by impartially thanking all those responsible for such an important result for the European Union: the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, to which I dedicated a considerable amount of my time, for having conducted the final stage in the committee extremely proficiently; and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I would also, however, like to mention Mr Vattela and all his team, with whom we worked for a long time, often disagreeing but certainly in the constructive spirit of the European Union."
"I would, furthermore, like to mention and thank the Chairman, now the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who chaired the committee and did a great deal of work on this issue, namely Mrs de Palacio; the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who gave me this task, and for doing so I therefore thank the Chairman Mr Poettering; the current Chairman, Mr Gargani, and also all the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in particular Mrs Berger who, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, was so patient and with whom we concluded a significant process; my colleague Mr Lehne, coordinator of the European People’s Party within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; the lawyer Mr Preto, who was certainly extremely valuable in bringing about everything that we have achieved; all the shadow rapporteurs; and, to conclude, the Italian Presidency."
"During the last six months, the Presidency has finished a task that began a long time before the Spanish Presidency and, together with Mr Buttiglione and all of the Italian delegation, it has allowed us, for everyone’s benefit, to bring this story to a close."
"Having dedicated most of this parliamentary term to this activity, I am happy."
"Now a new one is beginning, but this is certainly a milestone for the conclusion of the European internal market."
"I therefore thank everyone; I thank you, Mr President, and, once again, all the Members for the opportunity given to me."
"– Mr President, I too would like to start by thanking most warmly everyone involved in the work that we are now bringing to a conclusion – as the rapporteur mentioned, we spent four years working together on it, and it was, for me, one of the best experiences I have had in the European Parliament, involving getting to grips with a great deal of highly complex material."
"Let me thank the Commission, and also the Commissioner, who again reminded us today how very important this legislative project is in economic terms."
"When getting to grips with one formulation or another, one is all too ready to lose sight of the whole and no longer quite see how very important this project is, and I think it is vital that we should remind ourselves of that as things draw to a close."
"I also want to thank Mr Zappalà, the rapporteur, who has had to be very patient with me as I expressed what I sought."
"Opinions may differ about the Italian Presidency’s record, and different people in this House will assess it in different ways, but it can certainly chalk up as one of its credits the successful completion of this conciliation procedure, the result of which I will of course, tomorrow, be advising my group to adopt."
"I am not doing that half-heartedly, merely because it is a compromise, but because I am convinced that 90% of our result is very good."
"I would like to highlight a number of points that were of particular concern to us in Parliament and can be said to be enshrined in the outcome."
"We of course share the Commission’s goal of simplification and modernisation, which I see as having been largely achieved."
"It was important to us that electronic procedures should be made easier and electronic auctions introduced."
"When it came to the threshold values, we had differences of opinion."
"I regard the slight increase in the threshold values from what they had been previously as a good solution, especially because this means that smaller contracting authorities, such as municipalities, do not have to put projects in their area out to tender right across Europe, whilst the internal market continues to apply to larger projects."
"I also see it as significant that it has been possible to rethink the Utilities Directive, and, in particular, that we have succeeded in transferring postal services to it from their traditional directive, for this had been one of this House’s concerns, and that individual provisions for many sectors are now somewhat less stringent."
"I believe that sheltered workshops are now well protected; these are an important area, as are the joint purchasing bodies that more and more Member States are setting up, and, of course, all those provisions – particularly in view of enlargement, to which the rapporteur referred – that can be said to clarify the application of the locally-applicable provisions on labour law, social security, taxation and the environment."
"The conciliation procedure gave attention to, and was speedily able to resolve, the issue of national legislation on the award of contracts, which must, in future, be accessible on a website."
"The Internet is an important source of information for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and it is intended that it should facilitate more cross-border transactions."
"Reference has already been made to award criteria, which were without doubt the stumbling-block right up to the end of the conciliation procedure, and I find the result that we have achieved perfectly acceptable."
"We have secured the position of the case-law of the European Court of Justice, which has developed over a lengthy period of time."
"What we learned from Helsinki – and, thank heaven, on later occasions – has now been incorporated into law."
"I see this as very important, particularly in terms of legal certainty, and perhaps this legislative package expresses to some degree the value we attach to the case-law of the ECJ in this area."
"In conclusion, it only remains to me to appeal to the Member States to transpose this directive without delay and to do so in line with the new conception of it in order to create a real internal market for public-sector contracts, for more competition, and more transparency, but also for advances in the fields of environmental and social policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very satisfied with the outcome of this conciliation."
"When we consider the outcome and what we were aiming for, our assessment is that we wish in every respect to recommend what has emerged."
"Firstly, we succeeded, at the previous readings, in averting an increase in the threshold values that would have significantly limited the scope of this directive."
"That is something we are really pleased about."
"Secondly, we think we have achieved secure and modern tendering methods."
"I believe that, as previous speakers have said, we can now go in both for providing more information to businesses on the Internet and for enabling small businesses more easily to find out which rules apply."
"This will play a part in our successfully helping the administrations to modernise."
"I believe that this is very important now that we are talking about a competitive Europe."
"Our objective is to increase the number of cross-border tenders."
"When we began the debate, we were sometimes concerned about the reports we received at the time to the effect that there were so extremely few cross-border tenders."
"Our rapporteur in the Conciliation Committee, Mrs Cederschiöld, whom I had wanted to thank for her constructive work, mentioned that transparency had increased significantly."
"I believe that what the Conciliation Committee has arrived at, and which really is closer to the Liberal idea, is what the majority signed up to at second reading."
"It is important for competitors also to be able to see the final outcome of a tendering procedure and to be able to judge whether any errors have been made."
"That is what is most important in the fight against corruption and in the interests of greater value for money"
"As we all know, the issue of the social and environmental criteria has been much to the fore in this debate."
"We can now observe that the Commission has also prepared an action plan for modern environmental engineering."
"I really do believe that the final outcome we arrived at is a tool in this context too."
"We must not be afraid of modern environmental technology."
"Finally, I want to say that, following our last conciliation meeting, the Finnish press said that the case of Concordia Bus Finland, brought before the EC Court of Justice and relating to bus traffic in Helsinki, had led to a sound directive on public procurement."
"I was somewhat irritated about this, because no buses operate without drivers."
"I want to thank all the drivers who contributed to this end result, and I note that we have steered the matter into a safe harbour."
"My special thanks are due both to the Commissioner and his colleagues, who said just the right words at the right time, and to the Conciliation Committee’s secretariat for its quite excellent work."
"We have worked on this matter for many years, and it feels as though we have reached a conclusion."
"I hope it will help our administrations get greater value for money."
"Mr President, we have worked for a long time on these important procurement directives, and it is now time for a final debate and a vote on the outcome of the conciliation."
"I would take the liberty of providing a short résumé."
"Viewed in a Green perspective, the Commission’s original proposal was completely unacceptable when it came to environmental and social criteria in the case of public procurement."
"I was, however, very optimistic about the procurement directives once a majority of the European Parliament, at both first and second readings, had strongly supported the proposal to give the procuring parties greater freedom and legal entitlement to take account of, and incorporate, environmental and social criteria in public procurement."
"Unfortunately, I saw from the very beginning that the Commission did not really want to acknowledge the fact that Articles 2 and 6 of the Treaty, together with the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and other policy documents, clearly state that environmental and social considerations must be incorporated into all EU policy and that public procurement must be used to achieve the objective of sustainable development."
"The outcome of the conciliation is quite clearly better than the Commission’s original proposal and the old rules, but I think that we have unfortunately missed a unique opportunity to be as progressive as the pledges and the talk of sustainable development would seem to require."
"I think that the Council has demonstrated a stronger will and greater flexibility, for example through raising the threshold value."
"I nonetheless believe that, during the conciliation, there was a failure to resolve the important issue arising from the fact that, with a value of 14% of GDP, public procurement really could make a difference to the EU’s environmental policy and promote ‘green’ procurement."
"I would thank my fellow MEPs, who fought hard for this during the conciliation negotiations."
"The criteria said to be of an environmental character are among those that, according to the agreed wording, must be set by the procuring entity."
"This term does not, however, include the methods through which goods are manufactured. Nor does it include the life cycle perspective, that is to say the period from the manufacture of the goods to their becoming waste."
"Nor does it include the long-term effects, nor the internationalisation of the external costs."
"What, therefore, is meant by criteria of an environmental character?"
"Will not a discussion arise concerning the interpretation and implications of the term and, as a concomitant of this, legal uncertainty too?"
"I think we have missed a brilliant opportunity to promote sustainable development and an improved quality of life for the present, and future, generations."
"This was also the reason why the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance voted ‘no’ in the Conciliation Committee’s final vote."
"I believe that many members of the Greens/ALE Group will in any case vote in favour of the proposal. That is what I myself am going to do."
"Despite these criticisms I have made, I naturally hope that the package of draft legislation will promote open and free procurement and also, when all is said and done, still promote environmental and social considerations in this connection."
"Mr President, I was wondering exactly what Mrs Thors meant when she said that the proposal was being ‘steered into a safe harbour’, especially as she was looking directly at me at the time."
"Mr Zappalà has been the main driver on this issue, but it has been a pleasure to work with many colleagues."
"I also want to pay tribute to Mrs Cederschiöld for her wise leadership that has enabled us to arrive at a very satisfactory outcome to this conciliation."
"I would now like to move forward."
"The Commissioner gave a very powerful presentation about how important these reform directives are to the completion of the internal market."
"They now have to work in practice."
"One of the areas we worked on in this conciliation was that of measures that will encourage Member States to get these directives to work properly."
"I make no apologies for repeating what I said in my speech at first reading: we know that there are far too many contracts in all areas of public procurement that are not being properly put onto the Official Journal system."
"Essentially, governments are allowing their public authorities to evade the provisions of the public procurement system."
"We know from good practice in a number of Member States, of which Sweden is probably regarded as the best example, that where governments take this seriously, the provisions start to work effectively."
"Examples include setting up independent bodies to advise all the public agencies in the country concerned on how to work with the public procurement directives."
"We need to make sure that this is happening."
"I would like to pick up on the point made by Mrs Schörling on behalf of her colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group, and by others, that the contractual terms clearly have to include factors other than economic criteria – as we have seen from the famous Helsinki bus case."
"In terms of social and economic criteria this must be done in an open and non-discriminatory way as part of the published tender."
"That was the point we secured in conciliation and I think we arrived at a sensible agreement. This will be part of the new reform procedures that have to go out there and have to work for the sake of delivering and eventually completing the internal market."
"– Mr President, I agree with Mr Harbour;"
"Captain Zappalà and Captain Berger have indeed ‘steered us into a safe harbour’ after we were forced to pass through what were sometimes very choppy seas during this conciliation process."
"Let me also say that I am very satisfied with the outcome that we have reached, although – like everyone else – we would obviously have liked to achieve more."
"Nonetheless, we have achieved a great deal, and as a Social Democrat, I must also make the point that we have also obtained the endorsement of both the Commission and the Council."
"It is very positive, in my view, that we have managed to establish these criteria – as regards sustainability, environmental and social award criteria, and, for example, the special provisions for people with disabilities – and ultimately managed to secure the approval of the Commission and the Council. I think we can proceed very satisfactorily on this basis."
"Yes, we would have liked to achieve more in this area, but we have at least established these criteria as a means of exercising control in the contract award procedures."
"We have thus ensured that it will not always be the cheapest tender that is awarded the contract, but the most favourable."
"As Mr Zappalà has said very clearly, the most favourable is not necessarily the cheapest, for quality is important as well."
"We have achieved something more in this context, something I felt was very important and have repeatedly mentioned."
"By ensuring that the public sector has the option of deciding for itself which criteria, if any, it wishes to apply to the contract award procedure, we have strengthened the hand of local authorities."
"In this way, a certain measure of freedom has been maintained for the public sector in the regions and at local level, which these authorities need to be able to implement their own economic policies, and I think that this is a positive achievement."
"I would like to thank Mrs Berger again for her very good work."
"We have secured a positive outcome and we can vote for it with a clear conscience, even though, as I said, it would have been good to have achieved more."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all those involved in the conciliation."
"As Mr Zappalà pointed out, we were not always in agreement, but we did eventually reach a decision."
"These two directives are a step forward – not a huge step, as Mrs Schörling said, but at least some progress has been made."
"Comparing what was there originally with what we have today shows considerable progress."
"But why is this?"
"We have talked tonight about the huge market involved in the whole area of public procurement."
"The Commissioner himself mentioned the huge figures involved."
"But too often when we talk about that market and about public procurement we talk purely about an economic market."
"These two directives change all that: social and environmental criteria have now been introduced."
"This means that the tendering authority does not have to accept the lowest tender."
"Tendering authorities can also take into account recent case-law and I am glad that the Commissioner highlighted the 4 December judgment."
"We also have the July court decision on the Altmark bus case and, as Mrs Thors pointed out, the Helsinki bus case."
"This Parliament has added a social dimension to economic legislation."
"We must never forget that while we strive for a competitive economy by 2010, this has to be accompanied by social progress."
"That is why I will support tomorrow's vote: even though I voted against this conciliation I will actually now vote in favour."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Zappalà, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to join in the expressions of thanks."
"If, though, I compare the speeches that have been made here, I have the impression that the ship has come into several different harbours."
"I would like to share my own image of this harbour with you."
"Initially, it is true, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats did reject the common position."
"We take the view, however, that a number of substantial improvements have been achieved in the conciliation process, bringing the compromise more into line with our ideas, so that we can now vote for the outcome at third reading."
"In my view, these improvements lie primarily in the fact that this compromise proposal has a far more market-oriented focus than was the case even with the common position."
"The progress on liberalising public procurement through the internal market is maintained and, indeed, built on."
"We were worried that through the overemphasis on environmental and social criteria, the internal market would be rolled back compared with the position achieved in 1993."
"Thanks to Mrs Cederschiöld’s inspired leadership, but also due to the very substantial support from the Commission, this threat has been averted, so we can now vote in favour of this compromise result."
"We have not achieved all that we set out to achieve."
"The proposal still contains a number of very bureaucratic rules, some highly complex regulations and obscure phrasing."
"It is therefore not entirely in line with what we wanted in terms of better legislation."
"Nonetheless, I think it is also a step towards reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, and I am pleased that the Commission in particular has made such a substantial contribution, which we see lacking in the context of some other legislative proposals."
"I would like to thank everyone for the very positive cooperation."
"It is nice to be able to finish something that we started in this legislative term, and so we will all breathe a sigh of relief when we leave the Chamber today."
"Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I am able to note that we are finally obtaining comprehensive EU regulations governing public procurement."
"I am of course particularly pleased that these regulations make it possible for those who procure contracts also to use criteria other than price."
"I think it is important for us to use public procurement in order also to affect the development of society."
"We must favour products and manufacturers that, from a social point of view, operate along the lines we advocate."
"Environmental issues are central."
"If we wish to reduce food contamination and pollution of the external environment, we must favour manufacturers who have that approach."
"If we want to see gender equality in working life, we must favour workplaces where this is promoted."
"If we want everyone to have job opportunities and to be able to support themselves, we must of course favour companies that create jobs for people with disabilities."
"If we wish to bring about a fairer society that provides greater opportunity for participation, we must ensure that society is designed along those lines."
"It might be wondered whether we could have achieved more during the conciliation negotiations."
"That is a question that negotiators always ask themselves."
"Having devoted most of my adult life to negotiating, I know that, in negotiations, a point must be reached at which the parties agree."
"When that point has been reached, as I think it was in our own negotiations, it has to be acknowledged that the time has come to present the result."
"I think that the result we have presented in our decision is something we can defend and, in actual fact, be proud of."
"Parliament’s position on public procurement shows that decisions at Community level can be important for achieving a more humane society."
"It is an encouraging decision following a time-consuming and, at times, arduous piece of work."
"I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this outcome."
". Mr President, no questions have been addressed to the Commission and therefore I can afford to be very brief."
"I know parliamentary is dear, and therefore I shall use few words."
"I should like to say a few things in response to Mrs Schörling on the issue of production methods."
"I should like to reassure her about the findings of the European Court of Justice."
"In its ruling of 4 December 2003, the Court confirmed and repeated its finding in the famous Helsinki bus case, namely that a requirement, according to which the energy to be supplied must be produced from renewable sources, is, , admissible."
"The Court added that such an award criterion may be given a high importance, and in this case the relative weight was 45%."
"To conclude, and to reassure Mrs Schörling, the judgment confirms that, both under current law and under the joint text, production methods are legitimate award criteria and may be given quite a high weight provided always that the criterion is formulated and applied in such a way as to meet the four requirements set out explicitly in both the Helsinki case and in recital 1 of the joint text."
"I should once again like to express the thanks of the Commission that, as one Member said, work on this important file has been concluded within this legislature."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, the shadow-rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, and all who have contributed."
"I will end by thanking Mr Miller for agreeing, in the end, to support the proposal, even though he voted against it in the Conciliation Committee."
"We have also concluded the debate within its allocated time, so there is good news all round."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 10.30 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0006/2004) by Mrs Corbey, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (PE-CONS 3697/03 – C5-0629/2003 – 2001/0291(COD))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the verge of giving our approval to the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste."
"On 4 December, Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee approved the agreement reached with the Council by a large majority."
"As the rapporteur, I am very pleased with this, and I shall explain briefly why."
"There were two major points at issue and five minor ones."
"I shall begin with the minor points: firstly, the definition of packaging."
"I am sure you remember vividly the lobby and the debate on flower pots, CD cases, mascara containers and make-up pots."
"Parliament wanted to avoid a continuation of the debate on flower pots."
"The solution found is pragmatic: new products are not entered in the annexes, but the Commission is asked to give priority to examining, where necessary, those products that are the subject of legal controversy: CD cases, flower pots, toilet rolls and suchlike."
"The Council has accepted the substance of Parliament’s amendment of the basic definition of packaging."
"The second point concerned prevention, which this House saw as important."
"The environmental impact of packaging must be minimised."
"The introduction of a packaging environment indicator was the main feature of this."
"Parliament wants to encourage pilot projects, and its second reading amendment has been accepted almost in its entirety."
"This will undoubtedly be elaborated on in the debate on the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling that is already under way."
"The third point relates to the report."
"The Council has accepted Parliament’s amendment concerning the scope of the Commission’s report on the implementation of the Directive almost in its entirety."
"The fourth point concerns voluntary agreements."
"The possibility of reducing the transposition of certain provisions by means of agreements between the competent authorities and the economic sectors concerned has been fully accepted by the Council."
"This point is very important as far as the Netherlands, among others, is concerned."
"The last of the minor points concerns the deadlines."
"The existing Directive on packaging and packaging waste provides for a limited postponement for Greece, Ireland and Portugal."
"Parliament was prepared to grant a postponement from 2008 to 2010, the Council preferred 2012, and we agreed on 2011."
"The two more difficult points concerned the amendment regarding the new Member States, and the recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"Firstly, regarding the new Member States, the issue was who should establish the deadlines for these countries."
"Parliament wanted the Commission to present a proposal on which Parliament and the Council would then take a decision."
"The Council preferred to deal with this issue by means of a declaration on bilateral agreements with each acceding country on the basis of Article 57 of the Accession Treaty."
"Parliament strongly defended its second reading position."
"The result was the inclusion of a clearly worded recital in the Directive: this contains the derogation requests by the countries in question, and the final decision will be made in accordance with the appropriate legal procedures."
"From the point of view of Parliament, this signifies a considerable improvement on the original position of the Council."
"A particularly difficult problem concerned the implications of recent judgments of the Court of Justice for the Directive’s recovery targets."
"The Court’s interpretation of the concept of ‘recovery’ in recent judgments had been the subject of considerable debate."
"In these judgments, the Court of Justice concluded that waste incineration with energy recovery does not constitute recovery if that is not the main purpose of the operation, with the result that some Member States could unexpectedly find themselves in contravention of the Directive, either now or in the future."
"Views differed as to how to deal with the matter from a procedural point of view."
"Indeed, the implications of the judgments had not been addressed in either the common position or in second reading amendments by Parliament."
"The compromise solution finally found was to modify the relevant parts of the text of the original Directive."
"This made it clear that waste incinerated at incineration plants with energy recovery can count towards the targets of the Directive."
"All things considered, it is my opinion that our Parliament can be very pleased with this result, and, indeed, I recommend that everyone vote in favour of the agreement."
"Tomorrow’s vote brings the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste to an end, but not the debate on the wider context of recycling, waste prevention and the use of natural resources."
"The debate has already begun in this House, with the discussion on the thematic strategies presented by the Commission."
"This agreement on the Directive on packaging and packaging waste points the way towards a new scheme in legislation."
"Parliament wanted to see greater emphasis on the environmental impact of the legislation and a flexible way of working."
"In an enlarged, more diverse Union, it will no longer be possible for all 25 Member States to set the same targets for recycling and recovery."
"Our debates on eco-efficiency at first reading and on the economic cost at second reading lead us almost inescapably to the conclusion that countries’ optimum recycling percentages can differ substantially, and ultimately we must go down that path, too."
"To do so, however, we do have to set clear recycling aims first of all; indeed, that is ultimately the objective of this legislation."
"Another aim of this legislation is sustainable development, a concept to which we need to give flesh and blood."
"Today, with the revised Directive, we are taking a step towards the modernisation of packaging policy."
"A packaging environment indicator has the potential to stimulate the use of more sustainable packaging."
"In the longer term, packaging does not need to be an environmental problem, but could contribute to sustainable development."
"Constant innovation is the best guarantee of maintaining employment in the packaging sector, and I hope that the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste makes a small contribution to this."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to express my warm thanks to all the groups for their cooperation, and to say a word of thanks to the excellent conciliation team under the extremely capable leadership of Vice-President Imbeni."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, following a rather long and difficult negotiation, in the end we are going to have a Directive which, as well as being ambitious, is realistic and, above all, capable of being applied, because the dates and quantitative objectives set in it are well-balanced."
"I would therefore like warmly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, and thank her for her work and the flexibility she has shown in order to reach this agreement. This agreement has not been at all easy because, as well as the long and controversial debates we have held in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we have been faced with additional legal problems, resulting from the judgment of the Court of Justice in relation to what is understood by ‘recovery’."
"I would also like to thank all the Members who have made valuable contributions to improving this Directive and, in particular, the chairperson of the committee, Mrs Jackson."
"The work has truly been worth the effort, because the packaging Directive will have enormous consequences for the various economic actors involved: local councils, collection systems, companies producing packaging materials, the industry, etc."
"I would also like to make a particular appeal to consumers, who make up a sector which is essential to the system, to cooperate by taking all packaging to green points."
"Re-use, recycling and recovery are three options for managing waste."
"Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but I believe we must support all three because of what they have in common: any of them is always going to be better than depositing waste in dumps."
"With regard to the concept of prevention, I believe that, without leaving it aside, we must be flexible, particularly in the case of the agri-foodstuffs industry which – let us not forget – is the biggest user of packaging, since in this field we must balance environmental objectives with the strictest possible food safety criteria."
"Furthermore, the packaging-producing industry is already making huge efforts to improve the design of their products for the simple reason that it means a reduction in costs and, at the end of the day, that is a competitive advantage."
"As the European Commission has acknowledged, certain Member States will have more difficulty complying with the Directive for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructures, low population density or, simply, consumer habits."
"In this regard, I am delighted to have participated in the search for a solution accessible to all."
"Portugal, Greece, Ireland and the new Member States are going to have longer time limits for complying with this directive."
"I am aware that some of these countries are already making huge efforts and I am sure that they will achieve the objectives set."
"Finally, I trust that the problems stemming from the imprecise definition, following the judgment, of what is considered recovery will be urgently resolved for the good of everybody."
"Mr President, it has been a long hard road on this directive."
"We have to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work, we have to congratulate the Parliament for the way in which we took this all the way to conciliation and got a good result, and we now have a very ambitious package in front of us, a packaging package, which, I am afraid, is going to take some Member States a lot of time to digest."
"We have set some very tough targets."
"We have recognised that this directive will enter into force in a period when we are enlarging the Union and a whole series of standards and objectives that we previously had in the group of 15 will now have to be extended to 25 Member States."
"Recognising that we even have weak Member States amongst the current 15, we have sensibly given derogations."
"I cannot stand here tonight and say my own country is a shining example of progress as regards the recycling of packaging."
"I am afraid we have always been slow, we have always been behind the average and we are going to have to do an awful lot of very hard work in terms of building infrastructure and putting a whole range of measures in place to ensure that we achieve the objectives that we have set down in this legislation."
"Along with everyone else, we must do it: if we have signed up to legislation, we must accept the responsibilities of fulfilling the obligations it gives us, and that is something which I think the UK will do and all the Member States must do."
"We have to recognise that high environmental standards must be paid for, but high environmental standards will also give us benefits."
"We will also, in the longer term, create a cleaner and greener environment for ourselves and for our children."
"I commend this package to the House."
"Mr President, packaging waste constitutes a considerable environmental problem."
"It is good that targets are being set for waste recycling, but I should like to have seen some more demanding targets."
"In Denmark, we are already close to achieving the proposed recycling target."
"Not even more demanding targets for the recycling of environmentally hazardous packaging are sufficient, however."
"All materials that are damaging to the environment and people’s health must be removed from the waste cycle and replaced by ecologically sound alternatives."
"Such alternatives do exist now."
"The waste problem does not need to become any greater than it is."
"What I miss in the directive is reference to the rapid phasing-out of PVCs and phthalates."
"As long as PVCs and phthalates are used, a duty must be imposed upon them and used to pay both for the damage that has arisen through the use of PVCs and for the changeover to ecologically sound alternatives."
"The polluter-pays principle, confirmed by the Treaty, must be brought into use."
"In spite of these shortcomings, I shall vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in Mrs Corbey’s report."
"Mr President, it has indeed been a long, hard road."
"I welcome the outcome of the conciliation talks and I should particularly like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for her excellent work and understanding of the issues."
"As an Irish Member, I believe we have benefited from what has been known as ‘the Irish amendment’."
"It seems a long time since I tabled an amendment for a derogation – not from the targets, but from the timetable – for Ireland, Greece and Portugal and I thank colleagues for their understanding."
"We have to get the balance right between ambition and realism when it comes to the matters before us."
"I cannot speak for Greece or Portugal – their own Members will do that – but my own country certainly does not have an infrastructure in place to be able to meet the targets within the timetable that was required of other countries, although our Danish colleague has suggested that it is not ambitious enough."
"This is a balance which I really welcome."
"There is nothing to stop others being more ambitious in achieving delivery."
"I thank you sincerely for your understanding of the Irish position on this issue."
"As an island nation, Ireland imports 80% of its packaging material and has a very small indigenous recycling possibility; we have a scattered population."
"Demographics, infrastructure, size and isolation make it very difficult for Ireland to meet the same targets and deadlines as other countries."
"We were way behind when this started and over the last five years have almost caught up."
"The extra time we have now been given will hopefully allow us not to look for special treatment after 2011, and that has to be our ambition as a country."
"We in Ireland must achieve these targets in terms of managing our packaging waste and waste in general."
"At the moment we depend too heavily on exporting our waste, because we do not have the infrastructure in place to do so locally, despite a great catch-up over recent years."
"The recovery issue and the judgment of the European Court of Justice really do not impact on Ireland as we have no recovery or incineration facilities at the moment and will not have for some time to come."
"No doubt there will be an appeal, but I support that for those countries for which it is relevant."
"Again my thanks go to the rapporteur and to all colleagues for their particular understanding. I welcome what is before us here this evening."
"Mr President, I welcome the emphasis in this directive on the need to reduce discarded packaging and the increase in the targets for the recycling of packaging waste."
"Like my colleague Mrs Doyle, I am glad to see the derogations agreed for Ireland and indeed also for Portugal and Greece."
"I believe it is right and just that the accession countries should have a decisive say in when they feel they can reasonably implement this directive, remembering that they have to face the implementation of so many directives and regulations in the ."
"In Ireland we have quite recently introduced recycling and there has been a very positive response from the general public."
"I feel we need a well-established recycling mentality before moving on in any direction."
"Ireland is a net importer and 75% to 80% of our packaging is imported."
"We also have a limited capacity to use recycled packaging."
"We are not able to access the recycling markets easily and the expense involved is considerable for us."
"We need realistic targets as regards the new directives, but the government feels that it can fully implement this directive by 2011."
"The European Court of Justice ruling classing incineration as disposal means that we need to find other means of meeting recovery targets, and I would like to say at this point that there is very deep concern generally among Irish citizens regarding the use of incineration."
"As other countries are moving away from incineration, I believe that we in the European Union need to look very carefully at the way we are moving in this particular area."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes the outcome of the conciliation process and is pleased that the co-legislators decided to more than double the recycling target by 2008."
"The Commission also welcomes the fact that solutions could be found for two important and difficult issues."
"The first is the procedure for adopting a deadline for accession states, and the second is the question of the consequences of the recent court judgment on energy recovery."
"Concerning the deadline for the accession countries, a Commission proposal is under preparation."
"The Commission thinks that the Parliament needs to be fully involved in this important matter, therefore this proposal will be based on codecision."
"On the consequences of the Court judgment the Commission realises that not everybody is happy with the solution of transforming the recovery target into a target for recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery."
"However, it would have been difficult to take Member States to court for having interpreted ‘recovery’ in the same way as most Member States and the Commission would have done until the judgment."
"The view taken by the co-legislators may indeed avoid a period of legal uncertainty from which no one would have benefited."
"However, this should not hide the fact that we need to solve the recovery issue."
"This must be done, not only for packaging, but also for all waste."
"Therefore the Commission thinks that we need to review the status of recovery in the waste framework directive."
"The ongoing debate on the thematic strategy on waste prevention and recycling will be an important input to such a view."
"The Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, as well as all the Members who have contributed to ensuring the successful outcome of this important legislative process."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m."
". – Mr President, today we are examining a report which stems from the decision taken on 8 April 2003 to postpone granting discharge for the Committee of the Regions’ accounts."
"This happened because we received information at the eleventh hour about certain irregularities in the accounts."
"When the report had virtually been completed, we were informed that the accounts could contain irregularities; the informant was concerned that there could be irregularities in the reimbursements of travel expenses and daily allowances and potentially some instances of fraud."
"In view of this suspicion, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control asked for the discharge of the accounts to be postponed in order to carry out a detailed audit and to be able to establish a full picture regarding the suspected irregularities."
"The audit was eventually carried out by the Court of Auditors, who looked at the general budget of the Committee of the Regions and at the financial and administrative management of that budget."
"The results of the audit did not identify any serious irregularities."
"At the same time, OLAF produced a report regarding the possibility of fraud in the Committee of the Regions and did not find any evidence of fraud for personal gain or any intentional fraud on the part of Committee of the Regions staff."
"A few internal administrative deficiencies were identified, but were of little real significance, particularly given that between 2001, the period in question, and our meeting, the Committee of the Regions had amended its own internal rules and introduced a number of changes specifically designed to prevent the kind of irregularities that could have occurred in the past, and also promised to change the internal administration and provide training for staff to prevent any irregularities occurring."
"We have to acknowledge – and I personally have to state – that the Committee of the Regions has made an effort to clarify its internal organisation so as to improve accounting and it has produced regulations to prevent problems or duplications when reimbursing travel expenses and daily allowances for members of the committee."
"The fraud that was actually identified was of very little significance: a small amount, most of which has been cleared up, and the problem of the tiny sum still requiring clarification is currently being resolved in collaboration with a former Committee member."
"We therefore saw a rapid response on the part of the Committee of the Regions at all times, and a willingness to work with us, with Parliament, to improve compliance with the rules, and to achieve greater transparency and to allow us to feel that this problem was being addressed."
"In view of this, I recommend that Parliament approves the report I am presenting today on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and approves the discharge for the Committee of the Regions accounts together with the recommendations we have included in the report."
"Following advice from Parliament’s Legal Service, we have deleted from the report all specific references to the OLAF report."
"It seemed inappropriate to refer to a report which, by its very nature, is confidential. These quotes were therefore taken out immediately and we will not even be voting on whether they should be omitted – instead they will not be considered admissible, which does not alter the report significantly."
"As regards the amendments that have been submitted, I can tell you that I support Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6, but oppose all the others."
"I hope you will study this report carefully."
"It is the fruit of the labour and cooperation of most of the Committee on Budgetary Control. At all times we sought to improve accounting in the Committee of the Regions – both in our own interest as Members of Parliament and in the interest of the committee itself, given its importance as one of the European institutions."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my warm thanks to Mrs Avilés Perea, who mastered her difficult task as rapporteur with great diligence and thoroughness."
"The Committee of the Regions is the newest EU institution, and it is also a small one."
"In terms of its composition, it is extremely heterogeneous, at least as regards the political status and rank of its members in their home states."
"Could this be why we had so many difficulties with the 2001 discharge?"
"Shortcomings and even irregularities were drawn to the attention of the Committee on Budgetary Control as it was about to vote last spring on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, put on the brakes and recommended the postponement of the discharge and an audit of the practices being undertaken in the COR, preferably by the European Court of Auditors – a recommendation which the plenary took up."
"In the meantime, the rapporteur and the committee have carried out detailed work and are now proposing that discharge be granted to the Committee of the Regions for 2001."
"Yet this does not mean that the dubious incidents in the COR are forgiven and forgotten."
"They are likely to come to light again in the context of the 2002 discharge, especially as the Court of Auditors proposes to undertake a more detailed audit, something it felt unable to do in 2001."
"Mrs Avilés Perea’s report takes account of a number of recommendations by OLAF and makes clear demands of the COR."
"There are no indications of personal enrichment or the loss of financial resources."
"The incorrect calculation of travel allowances has now been regulated through recoveries, although in future, the maintenance of presence lists and the calculation of members’ allowances must be carried out scrupulously and be verifiable."
"Payment procedures must be in line with the financial regulations."
"There must be respect for the institutional role of the Internal Auditor."
"The President of the Committee of the Regions has announced the implementation of an action plan to improve administration and management, and this includes rules on dealing with whistleblowers. Whether or not there are to be disciplinary proceedings is something for the COR itself to decide."
"Overall, the Committee on Budgetary Control is very concerned about the extent to which an amateurish improvisatory approach has prevailed in the administration to date."
"We will monitor the improvements which have been called for, and which have been pledged, benevolently but with close attention so that the 2001 discharge is right and proper, thus encouraging the COR to keep to the rules in future."
"Mr President, in March 2003 when the Committee on Budgetary Control was about to vote on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001, I received a telephone call from the internal auditor of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Robert McCoy, as did several of my colleagues."
"Mr McCoy had alarming news for us: the information provided to Parliament by the Committee of the Regions in the course of the discharge procedure was incorrect."
"The next day, the Budgetary Control Committee decided that the vote should be postponed to give Mr McCoy a chance to present his views."
"He did so, and issued what he called a cry for help."
"He said that his views had been misrepresented by the Secretary-General and the Finance Director of the Committee of the Regions, and that, despite a series of reforms, the COR still flouted basic financial rules, in particular in relation to tendering procedures and Members’ expenses."
"As a result of Mr McCoy’s intervention, the Budgetary Control Committee, and subsequently plenary, decided to postpone discharge for the COR and called on that institution to commission – and I quote – 'a detailed, full and independent audit, to be carried out by an external and recognised institution – preferably by the European Court of Auditors – on the Committee's overall budget implementation, as well as the financial and administrative management; considers that the audit should examine, inter alia, the areas listed above and attest to the sound financial management of the institution'."
"At the same time I decided to refer the case to OLAF."
"The results of these investigations were shocking."
"In the case of the Court of Auditors it was shocking because we received a one-page document consisting of 300 words which basically gave the COR a clean bill of health."
"This was not what we had asked for."
"The OLAF report painted a quite different picture."
"It had found an endemic culture of unprofessionalism and improvisation."
"It uncovered evidence of tampering with tendering procedures by COR officials and false expenses claims by members – including former presidents – of the COR."
"It went on to say that the efforts of the administration had been focused on discouraging or destabilising the messenger of the bad news, in this case the financial controller, rather than to change things for the benefit of the COR."
"Mr McCoy was therefore right when he came to see us and he deserves an unreserved apology for the treatment he has been subjected to, and applause for his courage in coming forward."
"The COR has now begun to improve things: the Secretary-General has been removed from his post for different reasons – although the bungled process of his appointment was also likely to be a result of the administrative chaos at the COR; the President of the COR has announced a preliminary enquiry into the opening of disciplinary proceedings; a reform process has been set in motion involving all COR staff who wish to be involved and a former Member of the Court of Auditors is to advise the COR on the adequacy of the reforms."
"For these reasons the COR and its President deserve the benefit of the doubt."
"That is why my Group will be voting to grant discharge tomorrow, but will do so with very little enthusiasm."
"– Mr President, the previous speaker, Mr van Hulten, has given an excellent explanation of the background to the refusal to grant the Committee of the Regions discharge in April, and I think that Mrs Avilés Perea also does that in her resolution; she has done a very good job."
"As a result of the refusal to grant discharge, two bodies carried out investigations: the European Court of Auditors and OLAF."
"I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by the investigation by the Court of Auditors."
"An investigation that can be expressed in a couple of sentences is not what I would call ‘thorough’; it was rather too superficial an investigation for my taste."
"I have greater respect for the report by OLAF, which has examined the matter in greater detail."
"There have been a great many abuses; the great hope is that these will now disappear."
"In this regard, I agree with the previous speakers who said that the role of the Financial Controller is essential."
"It was a bad omen that, when the Financial Controller brought the abuses to light, one of the first things that the Administration of the Committee of the Regions did was to dismiss a member of his staff."
"I am very pleased, therefore, that this Parliament has adopted an amendment to the 2004 budget by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to give that Financial Controller, right now, two extra members of staff for the coming financial year."
"We consider the role of the Financial Controller essential in all the European institutions."
"It cannot be emphasised enough that this person must act completely independently – independently of the hierarchy – in order to express his or her opinion."
"We shall be supporting the critical tone of Mrs Avilés Perea’s resolution, because we think that she has done a good job."
"However, my group will not be voting in favour of granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions."
"We think that we are justified in this course of action in a year in which so much has been amiss."
"Mr President, just like the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, we consider the rapporteur to have done an excellent job in his report."
"It is a very critical report that indicates the sensitive areas when it comes to procurement and to cheating in connection with the reimbursement of travel expenses."
"We draw the same conclusion as the ELDR Group: no discharge should be granted."
"The criticism is too serious."
"Just as with the Eurostat story, we have been made aware of these problems through what is known as a whistle blower If the Committee of the Regions’ financial controller had not contacted us, we should never have discovered how bad things were."
"We should just be grateful that there are EU employees willing to take the risks involved in pointing out what is wrong."
"These assertions are also well corroborated in OLAF’s report."
"If we were to grant discharge, we should also be doing so to the Committee of the Regions’ Secretary General."
"That is something we think cannot be done."
"It is the Secretary General against whom OLAF believes that a disciplinary procedure should be instituted, so it would be out of place."
"We shall vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions."
"We think there is too much that has not been cleared up and that a still stronger desire should be shown to devise better procedures for the future."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Budgetary Control on its determination to shed every possible light on the management of the Committee of the Regions."
"We have gone a long way since February 2003."
"The first plan was to grant it discharge for satisfactory management, but the reports from the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed the need for the report."
"None of this would have been possible without the high professional and moral qualities – yes, you have to be able to stand up to pressure! – of Mr McCoy, the financial controller, who today deserves all the European Parliament’s gratitude."
"The amendments which I have tabled are in line with the report and are based on proven facts."
"In that, their adoption is essentially a technicality and I hope that a large number of Members will be able to support them."
"On the other hand, it seems to me premature to grant discharge."
"The Casaca report is a cruel reminder to those who saw fit to grant discharge to the Commission last April that it cannot be granted by giving the benefit of the doubt."
"We should not vote for discharge if there is no enthusiasm for it and not blow only the fuses."
"The Parliament, which has to check that the budget has been properly executed, must be certain of the progress made, of the measures taken, of any sanctions imposed, and not be content with promises or statements of intent."
"And as the Commission is attentively following our debates, I will take advantage of the fact to point out that this comment applies to everyone."
"It is not addressed to the Committee on the Regions alone."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is permissible, in the context of Mrs Avilés Perea’s report, to pay tribute to one’s own committee for once."
"I believe that we were very prompt in our response as soon as justified doubts arose – to which previous speakers have already made reference – about the way in which the Committee of the Regions managed public funds."
"I think it is important to make this point for once in this House."
"We have a Committee on Budgetary Control, and it is sensitive and flexible enough to exercise its responsibility within a matter of hours."
"I do not believe that any problems were caused by the decision to postpone discharge for the Committee of the Regions as a result of the concerns addressed to us. Indeed, I believe it showed that occasionally, there are small institutions within the European Union – so-called small institutions, although our taxpayers would probably take a different view – which might have a budget of EUR 30 million, where the members turn up once every few months and perhaps deliver an important speech before a plenary, and where otherwise, there is a great temptation to indulge in petty empire-building within the European Community."
"I am most grateful to the President and his staff at the Committee of the Regions for having drawn the right conclusions from our comments, but I think it will be a lesson for us in other cases as well."
"I endorse the comments made by the previous speakers, and will gladly vote for Mrs Avilés Perea’s report."
"Thank you, Mr Bösch."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0004/2004) by Mr Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the action taken by the Commission on the observations contained in the resolution accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2001 financial year (COM(2003) 651 – C5-0536/2003 – 2003/2200(DEC))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, thanks to the dedicated hard work of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that of various individuals in the European institutions, it has finally been possible to put a stop to serious wrongdoing in the European statistics body, Eurostat."
"The audit carried out by the Commission’s internal audit service, and by Eurostat’s audit department, deserves our praise and was crucial in obtaining this result."
"The action plan presented by the committee, aimed at concentrating on the most important statistics, at reducing the amount of work outsourced by the institute and at making statistical data available to the public, addresses our main concerns. It also ensures that the motivation for such work is not purely commercial and increases transparency and responsibility."
"We shall, however, carefully monitor how this plan is executed and how all the work carried out is revised and audited."
"Community institutions will be increasingly concerned with analysing and auditing the effectiveness and the simplification of procedures, the quality of work, and the relevance and value of the matters concerned."
"In any event, it is now obvious that the current process of reform of the Commission has not sufficiently clarified the relative responsibilities of the Directors-General and the Commissioners and has given no guarantees of respect for the golden rule of democracy: that accountability and ultimate responsibility rest with political office-holders."
"Concerns have surfaced regarding the manner in which we have proceeded unchecked towards outsourcing a wide variety of EU administrative functions and in which more complexity has been introduced, due to the implementation of more bureaucratic rules, which are a long way from fulfilling the aims of public spending efficiency. These concerns are not, however, confined to Eurostat."
"It is clear that in most contracts awarded by Eurostat to third parties, other Commission departments or even interinstitutional bodies were also involved."
"There is particular consternation that, unlike Eurostat, nothing appears to have changed in the departments that monitor external help and that are responsible for authorising spending in some of the most contentious areas."
"The accounting system must be modernised and assurances must be given that the system is indeed capable of addressing the most glaring problems in managing and monitoring external contracts and Community money administered by third parties."
"A further area in which progress appears to have been either very slow or non-existent is that of the common agricultural policy."
"The framework drawn up by the excellent special reports by the Court of Auditors regarding export refunds is a cause for concern."
"It is unacceptable that, on key points, the 2003 report does no more than repeat what was said in 1990 because absolutely nothing has changed in 13 years."
"It is unacceptable that the Commission has not yet implemented its policy of moving irresponsible employees in the area of export refunds, when this is an area in which urgent action is required."
"It is unacceptable that export refunds for sugar continue to be awarded to countries from which we import sugar that is duty-free."
"The Community budget demands transparency, yet the Commission still refuses to make public the list of payments made to commercial undertakings, particularly in this area of export refunds and surplus disposal mechanisms."
"In a recent opinion poll, food product adulteration came top of the list of concerns among European citizens, both in the Europe of the 15 and the Europe of the 25."
"The Commission, however, continues to neglect its duties in this area."
"Community money finances extensive operations to count olive trees and evaluate their productive capacity, an activity that is neither worthwhile nor effective, while it neglects the fight against the adulteration of olive oil."
"The budget imposes heavy fines on farmers who produce more than their quota of milk, yet the Commission refuses to intervene when large European commercial undertakings sell, and receive EU subsidies for, surplus butter adulterated with lubricants and beef tallow."
"To conclude, I should like to say a word about the challenges facing us."
"The Commission is preparing to propose an increase in the sums earmarked for research and development, an area which, as I have said, has been synonymous with red tape and inefficiency."
"If the mindset in this area does not change radically, if it does not streamline its underlying philosophy, if it persists with the unwieldy mechanisms it has used to date, the Commission will transform a good idea into bad policy."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank Mr Casaca for his comprehensive report."
"I should say that I can only take up your final comment for the next Financial Perspective in those areas where the regulations are actually to be revised."
"This report has been prepared with the greatest care and was presented to this House on behalf of the committee."
"In the report, the rapporteur discusses all the key issues dealt with in the Commission's follow-up report – Eurostat in particular – and the necessary conclusions to be drawn from them."
"I would also particularly like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for her great commitment as well as the rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, and Mr Bösch and Mr Sörensen for their constructive contributions."
"It was in 2001 that the Commission embarked on the implementation of the administrative reform measures."
"We have now successfully progressed a considerable distance along the reform road."
"However, along this road, we frequently encounter obstacles that require adjustments and improvements."
"In two weeks’ time, the Commission will present the next progress report on the reforms."
"In it, we will also provide detailed explanations of the measures announced by President Prodi last November."
"At the same time – that is, in two weeks’ time – we will also present proposals for the revision of the OLAF Regulation, which we have discussed here in the context of the Bösch report."
"In the coming week, the Commission will also adopt the progress report on the modernisation of the accounting system and improvements in the early-warning system."
"Last week, the Commission adopted a Eurostat action plan as the follow-up to the restructuring agreed last year; the rapporteur has mentioned the various measures arising in this context."
"The Commission has learned the lessons of experience, especially from the Eurostat affair."
"The grave irregularities occurred before this Commission’s term in office."
"The Prodi Commission has been criticised for failing to respond to this situation more swiftly, but, once it was fully informed – in July 2003 – about the seriousness of the situation, the Commission did take action, and we intend to implement President Prodi's Eurostat action plan."
"This applies especially to measures ensuring that in future, the Commission is informed more quickly about problems requiring political action."
"The annual activity reports and the Directors-General’s statements form the cornerstones of a new and transparent system of internal control."
"For the third year of the activity reports, we have already agreed various further improvements concerning, for example, the timeframe as well as the more precise presentation of reasons and facts giving rise to concerns."
"We have agreed uniform norms for internal control and in future, the Central Financial Service of the Directorate-General for Budgets will provide information twice a year of the work undertaken by their internal-audit staff on the implementation of these norms."
"The progress report which I have mentioned, and about which my fellow-Commissioner Mr Kinnock has already informed the Committee on Budgetary Control, reaffirms that all Commissioners must reassure themselves that the systems of internal control adopted and administered by the Director-General operate satisfactorily. It also states that the Commissioners must reassure themselves that audits are accompanied by appropriate follow-up measures."
"If this is not the case, the Commissioner must issue instructions so that improvements can be made."
"New financial regulations have also been in force for the last thirteen months, and these substantially reduce the risk of fraud, especially the new rules on the allocation of subsidies and allowances and the strict rules excluding conflicts of interest."
"As regards accounting, the new financial regulations have restructured the system."
"They charge the Commission’s accounting officer with the task of validating the systems used to produce accounting data."
"However, it is not his task to carry out central and random checks, and nor does he have any staff available for this purpose."
"The authorising officers are responsible for this, and the Directors-General are responsible for ensuring that the control systems are established in line with the financial regulations and the sectoral rules."
"Under Article 60 of the new financial regulations, authorising officers bear full responsibility for financial procedures. The Prodi Commission has thus implemented the recommendation set out in the second report by the independent experts, which was approved by this House."
"Important lessons which the Commission has learned from the Eurostat affair concern the exchange of information and inter-service cooperation, for example, between the internal audit service, the internal audit capabilities, and the horizontal directorates-general, for it must be ensured that information about irregularities penetrates as far as political level and results in the adoption of immediate measures."
"This Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control has rightly placed the greatest emphasis on this aspect throughout the entire debate."
"The Eurostat affair made last year a very difficult time, and I think that applies to the Commission as much as to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The President of the Commission made a very detailed statement on all aspects here in this House on two separate occasions, and then joint work was undertaken to develop the necessary conclusions and changes."
"Let me assure you that the Commission, which launched and implemented the administrative reform with great commitment, will be consistent in implementing the necessary additions to that reform."
"– Mr President, my first words clearly have to be congratulations to Mr Casaca for his report."
"Not only because of the document itself, but also for the preparatory work that went into it: finding a consensus, harmonising, exercising caution, and bringing all of this together in a report which, first and foremost, is complex."
"Complex because it is a follow-up report, in the strict sense of the term, while at the same time the subject matter is new and deals with something that shook us and which is now shaking public opinion."
"I would like to highlight a few elements of this follow-up aspect, such as the eagerness to implement fully the internal control standards, to complete an audit of the Commission’s treasury system, to introduce the payment of interest accrued in the case of Community advance payments, to address the question of recovery payments and also subjects which were already common currency in the Committee on Budgetary Control: the reform of the accounting system, for example, or the common agricultural policy – which is mentioned specifically by the rapporteur – and, above all, in relation to export refunds and the prevention of fraud in the sector."
"Nonetheless, as I said, this report marks a first: it is the first time the question of Eurostat has been dealt with in a report."
"We have been surprised by some of the questions which have come up in relation to this subject."
"Let me go through them."
"Firstly, the fact that the rules on exchanges of information, which have been in place since the beginning of this parliamentary term, have not been implemented."
"Secondly, it is surprising that there is no register of the owners of all the companies that have been awarded contracts and that apparently it would be virtually impossible to establish who is behind the companies participating in calls for tender issued by the Commission."
"So now, at this late stage, we still have our doubts about the scale of the problem and who is responsible."
"What is more, when we tried to contact certain sources, we encountered the incredibly valuable contribution of the auditors and the whistle-blowers, on the one hand, who filled the gaps in our knowledge about what had happened, and at the same time, we found a glaring lack of information from OLAF, which is what has led – as was stated in this House barely a month ago – to the call for regulatory reform. In particular, reform to prevent OLAF becoming a pretext for holding discussions about any given topic behind closed doors and reducing transparency."
"As regards the measures which have been adopted, I think they are constructive and useful. For example, the decision to establish a mechanism for information flows between the auditors in each Directorate General and the internal Audit Service, the desire to establish and give structure to each Commissioner’s responsibilities, to protect whistle-blowers from potential reprisals and a review of the early warning system – also known as the blacklist – to prevent companies that have behaved fraudulently or inefficiently in relation to the Commission from receiving further contracts and subsidies."
"In short, Mr President, this is an open report which also offers a link to the report on the approval of the financial management for 2002, which will provide an opportunity to evaluate some of the measures proposed in this report."
"It will also be the time when we will be able to plug certain gaps in our knowledge, which we hope will be filled in by OLAF."
"– Mr President, since it is already after 10 p.m., I will get straight to the point without any preliminaries."
"We Social Democrats have repeatedly said, over these past months, that the priority for us – over and above the media’s one-day wonders such as calls for resignations – is the issue of how to bring about structural changes in the Commission and in relations between the Commission and OLAF."
"In my view, this position remains fundamental to our policies."
"Of course we can discuss the Commissioners’ individual political responsibility – I have no objection to that – but in light of all that we have learned from the Eurostat affair, we have to recognise first and foremost that we must put the Commissioners in a position to exercise this political responsibility in the first place."
"After all, what we encountered in this particular instance were hair-raising conditions as regards responsibilities, structures and information processes."
"One thing I am pleased about, although I do not endorse it politically: I am pleased to see that it establishes clarity."
"Admittedly, there is the amendment proposed by the Liberals – I can assure Mr Mulder that I would be happy to talk about this – which, as it were, flies the flag for political responsibility."
"At the same time, however, I welcome the clarity with which the Liberals propose a deletion, namely of the very paragraph in the Casaca report which calls for the directorates-general to answer to the Commissioners at long last."
"That is a clear alternative."
"Structural changes are needed so that we do not face the problem, every five years, of which Commissioner we call upon to resign, while the apparatus is allowed to carry on blithely as before."
"That is not the alternative that we Social Democrats want to see, to put it bluntly."
"That does not mean that all that glitters in the Commission is gold, however. Frankly, the opposite has generally been true."
"The things we have witnessed there: we have been presented, to great fanfare, with a proposal which now finally states in writing that the officials must inform the Commissioners about any landmines that might be lying around."
"Well, that is wonderful, I must say."
"I was under the impression that this was already standard administrative practice."
"If we have to put this in writing from the outset, what does that say about conditions in place?"
"That is one thing that has absolutely astounded me – although perhaps I should not have been too surprised. I think we really have to say that there must be an end to the Commission always coming up with too little too late."
"We are fed up with it; Mr Bayona de Perogordo has already mentioned the 2002 discharge."
"By then, if you do not mind, you have to come up with the goods."
"As I have said before, if you fail to do so, we can look forward to some entertaining days together between now and the end of your term in office!"
"– Mr President, I agree with Mr Kuhne, and in view of the late hour I, too, shall get straight to the point."
"In contrast to the Committee of the Regions – the previous item on the agenda – we did grant the Commission discharge in April of last year."
"At that time, too, I was the spokesman for my group and was able to put our arguments forward."
"One of the arguments was that the Commission was on the right track to reform."
"We still believe that to be the case."
"Scarcely had the ink dried on that resolution when the Eurostat affair erupted."
"That was no small matter."
"Eurostat is not just any old branch of the Commission."
"It produces extremely important statistics on the Stability and Growth Pact, on the contributions of the Member States, and, if things are not going well there, how reliable are the statistics themselves?"
"Thus, it was not for nothing that many people became very worked up over these revelations."
"We think that, on the whole, the Commission has shown vigour in righting the wrongs at Eurostat."
"A number of problem areas remain, however, and, indeed, several people have already alluded to these."
"First of all, how are we to deal with the role of OLAF?"
"I always thought it strange to be told by the Secretary-General that OLAF had asked that we should keep things secret and not pass them on."
"I do not know many officials who are required to keep things of this nature secret for their political superiors; in not one administration does such a thing happen."
"Officials should keep their political superiors fully informed, and I think that that is clearly the lesson to be learnt from this affair."
"What is essential as far as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is concerned is political accountability."
"The fact that a Commissioner does not know something cannot mean that he or she is not politically accountable."
"We have sought to raise this point in an amendment to the resolution, on which, indeed, we shall be voting tomorrow, and we also think that, when the hearings of the new Commissioners are held shortly – although it will depend on the new Parliament – we will have to question them on this point."
"After all, as far as we are concerned, this affair has shown President Prodi’s words at the start of his term about the individual accountability of Commissioners to be not entirely satisfactory."
"We hope that this will be raised at the new hearings, as I have said, because we must be able to declare to the European political elite, in particular, that someone in Europe is accountable for something."
"Mr President, today, we know a lot more about what happened in Eurostat than we did when the decision was taken to grant discharge for 2001."
"It is very possible that the decision would have been otherwise if we had known what we know today."
"There is no doubt that what took place that year were serious offences against the Financial Regulation: secret accounts, embezzlement and obvious conflicts of interest."
"Mr Casaca’s report is not bad."
"It is critical, but what is missing is a conclusion."
"We think it fair that the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat should have taken the political consequences and resigned."
"In many ways, this scandal resembles those that caused the Santer Commission to resign."
"A systematic and organised misuse of EU funds has taken place, and there has been a failure to intervene in time."
"Mr Solbes Mira says that he was not informed until April 2003, but we all know that there had been many warning signs before that date in auditors’ reports and in the press, as well as warnings by Parliament."
"When Mr Prodi began his term of office, he was very clear about political responsibility."
"The Commissioners were responsible for what happened within their Directorates-General."
"That proud watchword, issued at the beginning of the term of office, proved to have little substance when it came to the Eurostat affair."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I express my satisfaction with the work carried out by the Committee on Budgetary Control and by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate."
"I must, however, emphasise that the picture that emerges from reading the report is altogether worrying."
"What emerges is the image of a European Commission shrouded in secrecy and a lack of transparency, which does not communicate with the other institutions; a stratified Commission with a bureaucratic complexity of functions, delegations and offices which is in fact manifested by a failure to shoulder administrative and political responsibility, both on the part of Director-Generals and the Commissioners."
"An example of this, as other Members have mentioned, would be the Eurostat affair for which no one has to date completely assumed responsibility."
"On the contrary, we have, on several occasions in recent months, seen attempts by the Commission to swiftly close the case, to settle it as if it were nothing, as if Parliament’s calls for clarity were in fact a real nuisance and as if the Commission were indeed a class of untouchables above everyone, MEPs and citizens included."
"It is also surprising that President Prodi, so diligent in ensuring that rules are strictly complied with – I am thinking, for example, about the recourse to the Court of Justice on the Ecofin decisions on the Stability and Growth Pact – dealt so lightly with such an abominable scandal such as the one involving Eurostat."
"I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that, over and above the naïve and vague declarations of principle by the Commission – declarations that we have again heard this evening– we are waiting for a strong signal, a rigorous reform that will really change the system."
"– Mr President, last year, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities opposed granting discharge to the Commission in respect of its budgetary management in 2001."
"The facts have now confirmed beyond any doubt that this was justified."
"Just weeks after the vote on discharge, information that the Commission had withheld on the Eurostat affair came to light."
"The combination of a seriously flawed accounting system, an excessively slow process of administrative reform and insufficiently independent internal audits was the last straw."
"Like President Prodi, Commissioners Solbes Mira and Schreyer have demonstrated in both word and deed that they have not learnt sufficient lessons from the enforced resignation of their predecessors five years ago."
"Time and time again, the Commission seeks to talk Parliament round with fine words and promises and with hefty reports, with no visible results as regards its own internal reform."
"It was not until the second half of 2003, when it could procrastinate no longer, that the Commission finally began to act."
"We can only conclude that this Commission cannot keep abreast of the facts in its budgetary management, and is not meeting its political responsibility."
"Finally, I should like to mention that we in this House owe a great deal to the brave Commission whistle-blowers Paul van Buitenen and Marta Andreasen."
"They have the right to see their names fully cleared."
"We have not forgotten that there are many dedicated, upright officials working for the Commission."
"It is unfortunate, though, that they are being thwarted by an internal hierarchy that seeks to serve its own interests rather than those of Europe’s citizens."
"The rotten apple spoils the whole barrel."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, never before, in my seventeen years of membership of the Committee on Budgetary Control, has a follow-up report on a discharge which has already been granted left so many fundamental questions unanswered."
"They relate to openness, to the provision of prompt and comprehensive information from the Commission to Parliament and within the Commission itself, and to the assumption of responsibility by the Commissioners for abuses that have arisen."
"It seems that the shadow of the past is catching up with us."
"The rapporteur, Mr Casaca, has worked hard to produce this painstaking report."
"I would like to thank him in particular, as well as the committee as a whole for its outstanding work."
"The main issue in this report is to investigate and address the improper practices in and around the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), such as slush funds, cronyism, violations of the financial regulations, lax treatment of the mobility rules, and various other things. If the Commission had taken seriously Parliament’s warnings about Eurostat in its reports of February and March and investigated what was going on, and had informed Parliament accordingly, the discharge would have been postponed from April to October."
"This would not have been serious, but would have given the Commission enough time to adopt the measures that it is now trying to rush through with astonishing speed."
"Yet again, the bottom line is that what we have is an information shortfall."
"What, too, about political responsibility?"
"So far, not one Commissioner has admitted any responsibility."
"Admittedly, some errors have been acknowledged, but a clear admission has yet to come."
"That is regrettable, in my view."
"Claiming ignorance is no defence against responsibility."
"We are therefore pushing for this supposed ignorance to be removed by ensuring that the Commissioners finally close the yawning information gap between the officials, even to the highest ranks, and the Commissioners themselves."
"As early as 1999, the Commission equipped itself with rules on this issue."
"It is apparent that they still only exist on paper, unless what Commissioner Schreyer has just told us becomes reality."
"I would be delighted if that were to occur."
"OLAF, too, cannot serve as an excuse for the Commission’s inaction."
"The duty to exercise proper and thorough supervision lies, after all, with the Commission."
"Are the internal audit reports produced by the directorates-general being disregarded and the valuable audits carried out by the internal audit service being ignored by the Commissioners?"
"What also concerns us deeply is the way in which the whistleblowers have been treated."
"They have drawn attention to numerous abuses."
"The current rules do not guarantee them protection."
"Faced with all this harsh criticism, why has the committee not proposed the dismissal of the entire Commission or individual Commissioners?"
"This is my response: it is of no benefit to Europe if the irregularities continue at Eurostat."
"They must be cleared up – and that means now, by this Commission."
"We want to support the action plan and cooperate so that there is no repetition of these incidents in future."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we see what the Commission is offering by way of lessons learned from the Eurostat affair, cynicism would seem to be the only appropriate response."
"On this issue, Commissioner, you are disavowing your own President."
"As early as September last year, and again on 18 November, President Prodi announced to this House that he would submit an action plan before the year’s end."
"In December, we were fobbed off until January, and now it is the end of January and we are still waiting for the proposals which have been announced and which are primarily intended to achieve a rapid improvement in the OLAF Regulation."
"Yet the Commission knows perfectly well that this is a race against time, and I can tell the Commissioner that time is precisely what we do not have."
"It is not possible to have two readings on 10 February."
"How do you see this working?"
"Action is needed."
"This House has tabled appropriate proposals for your attention."
"I have the impression that it is the same old story in the Commission: Who is Commissioner, under which Director-General?"
"I say this in all clarity."
"Yet the differences of opinion could be addressed relatively quickly."
"We need clear priorities for OLAF."
"It was your institution that said that OLAF had failed in the Eurostat affair."
"I say that in all clarity as well."
"We need priorities."
"We need a priority as regards protecting the subjects of the investigations, and I think we also need some amendments to the financial regulations."
"The responsibility of the authorising Directors-General is a case in point."
"It is right that the Directors-General should bear full responsibility for what happens in their directorate-general, but it is also true, especially in light of the Eurostat experience, that control is better than trust."
"You have not upheld this principle so far, and I think it is high time you did."
"I would remind you of that, Commissioner."
"Ultimately, that will be the key benchmark against which your work is measured at the end of this Prodi Commission’s term in office."
"– Mr President, we now come to the follow-up report on the 2001 discharges which contains many interesting points and which constitutes an excellent piece of work on the part of the rapporteur, Mr Casaca. It seems, however, that most of those present are concerned about one subject in particular: the fraud uncovered in Eurostat just when we were finalising the discharge of the budget management for 2001, and therefore just when Mr Casaca’s report was being drafted."
"Unfortunately we did not pay much attention at the time, and it was only in the summer, July to be precise, that the Commission really registered the gravity of the matter in hand and began to react."
"Fortunately the Commission did begin to react and to set in motion a series of internal reforms which were completely necessary and which seek to do away with a culture and approach which are outdated, inappropriate and have generated a great many problems."
"For example, we need to reduce external involvement, since this leads to even less control, and in turn to even lower reliability in terms of how contracts are concluded and in terms of the final outcome anticipated when they were put up for tender."
"Another problem which has become apparent in the Eurostat case is the very poor internal information system within the Commission."
"Information exchanged between different levels – namely between the Directorates-General and the Commissioners – is limited, and totally absent in some cases, although this Commission did establish a code of conduct in 1999, which it has not implemented."
"I presented a report which the rapporteur has incorporated more or less in its entirety, with a view to improving internal information flows within the Commission because, in my view, if internal information channels had worked properly, many of the problems could have been avoided and we would not have ended up in the current situation."
"I also believe the internal reform of the Commission needs to be reviewed. At the outset there was a great deal of enthusiasm for the reform, fully supported by Parliament, but it has proved a slow, difficult and sometimes inefficient process."
"This is why, Mr President, we have to conclude that the Eurostat revelations show that we need to seek a solution to this problem and also to other internal problems in the Commission, with a view to everything working better, which will benefit all of us."
"Mr President, I was asked earlier on today by one of my colleagues for a rebuttal of the allegations of fraud in the European Union, and so I started off with a great surge of energy, mentioning that 80% of the EU’s budget is spent within the Member States, and most fraud occurs within the Structural Funds and agriculture."
"So I started off well, but then I suddenly had to slow up because I thought about the kinds of cases that have been in the papers recently – the Eurostat case obviously springs to mind."
"The problem there is that there a scandal going on and it is difficult to rebut it."
"The Commission sat on the report, the General Audit Service did not open the box and look at the report and we have to ask why Mr Solbes did not keep a closer eye on his department."
"I can rebut it by saying that the procedures for stopping this kind of thing were already in place, but the departments were overworked and there was no time for the system to work through."
"It was during the early days of the reform process."
"It is important, however, that we do not continue to allow the Directors-General to take all the responsibility."
"We have to see political responsibility by individual commissions. They have to shoulder this."
"It may be worth people taking note of the outcome of the Hutton report today: we have seen the BBC found guilty of incompetence."
"It is interesting that it is not the Director-General of the BBC who has gone, but the Chairman of the BBC."
"It is the political head – not the administrative head."
"We should bear that in mind and think about what that means in this context."
"The accounting system has also, of course, come in for criticism and I could explain at this point that there are only two countries in the whole of the European Union that have implemented the kind of accrual accounting system that we want to see."
"This Parliament and the Court of Auditors, however, asked the Commission to get on with it."
"Of course, we must also look internally at the kinds of problems we have here in Parliament."
"We are just about to enter an electoral campaign and many of us are enthusiastic about the whole European Union ideal, but we have to sell it in the face of a really difficult press, so you must help us to do more to counteract these allegations of fraud."
"Mr President, after Parliament gave discharge to the 2001 Community budget in April last year, we must now evaluate the measures adopted by the Commission, as a follow-up to the recommendations contained in the framework resolution that gave this discharge."
"It is firstly important to emphasise the excellent work that Mr Casaca has done as rapporteur, which deserves praise, as it will certainly leave a positive mark on the current legislative period. It also underlines the fact that Parliament is far from being a spent political force."
"Among the many areas that he could have examined, the rapporteur wisely chose to concentrate on the accounting system, the operations and monitoring of Eurostat and the implementation of the common agricultural policy."
"As regards the accounting system and the implementation of the CAP, the situation has developed in a far from satisfactory manner. The Commission must therefore speed up the introduction of measures to standardise and streamline the accounting system and must pay special attention to monitoring financial flows relating to refunds, exports and management of stock."
"As for Eurostat, given that most serious wrongdoings were committed prior to 1999, it is worrying that, in all probability, contraventions of financial regulations have continued beyond 1999."
"It falls to the Commission to learn the appropriate lessons from this, which do not end at financial irregularities, but in fact take on political dimensions that undermine the very workings of the institutions."
"While the report does not call for any kind of witch-hunt, which would be most unwelcome at the current stage of the European process, it does make it quite clear that Eurostat might not be the only case and, worse, might not be the most serious case detected in the Commission’s activities."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that we must not lose sight of the essence of the political message sent out by proving irregularities and that the rapporteur’s prudent, sensible and workable recommendations must be duly adopted, complied with and enforced."
"Commissioner Schreyer has taken good note of all of the speeches, contributions and suggestions, and she will of course report what has been said in our debate to the College of Commissioners."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m."
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0003/2004) to the Commission, on the White Paper on European Space Policy."
"Mr President, I welcomed the timeliness and the quality of the action plan presented to us for implementing the European space policy."
"This policy was re-launched when the United States reworked its strategy and when the ESA and NASA reported exceptional successes that excited the world."
"Space policy is crucial for international cooperation in research, for the Lisbon strategy and for guaranteeing Europe’s independent access to space."
"The plan that we are discussing is of a horizontal nature in that it concerns many Community policies, from agriculture to communications."
"After the Galileo project we are awaiting the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security project."
"I share the desire to pool investment resources to achieve objectives that no country can achieve on its own, and I agree with the intention to take a more determined approach towards coordinating research, technological innovation and industrial policy."
"There are two issues, however, that I urge the Commissioner to take note of."
"The first concerns the repercussions, for the European programme, of the new strategy established by the most important space power in the world, with which we have strong ties in terms of collaboration."
"The second concerns the discrepancies between Europe’s ambitions and the resources needed to implement the most important part of the space programme, and this seems to be the issue that the White Paper has left open."
"The complex issues influencing this programme do indeed concern the constituent process as regards the competences for space and common defence, but also the political decisions, both national and Community, that are called for to make the European economy more competitive."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Bodrato on the quality of his report and I would like to include Commissioner Busquin in those congratulations since, in the course of this legislature, which is drawing to a close, he has been absolutely crucial in the European Union becoming a space power."
"I do not believe the intergovernmental level is enough today and, in a world where competition in space matters is growing, we must underpin the development of space and the European Union’s space autonomy with a strong political power, which is embodied by the European Union."
"I believe that is the essence of what has happened during this legislature."
"Personally, I am glad about it."
"Another thing that has happened is that we have launched an ambitious programme, the Galileo programme, in which a number of countries in the world are interested, China in particular."
"I would like to raise a number of points about the White Paper and Mr Bodrato’s resolution."
"The first point is about the budget."
"I believe it is absolutely essential for us to be very ambitious about space and in particular that our ambitions about space should be part of an industrial policy."
"An independent space programme is not simply a matter of sending devices into Europe’s space, it is also about mastering the basic technologies and their civilian applications, of which there are a great number."
"The second point is about the link between the military and civilian."
"I think we should tie in our thinking, that of Commissioner Busquin and the DG for Research, with what is happening in the common foreign and security policy, because it is well known that the Americans and all the existing space powers, including the Russians and the Chinese, have devoted a large part of their space developments to military applications."
"The third point concerns enlargement."
"I think a number of the countries that are going to be joining Europe are not necessarily going to feel interested in Ariane or in space developments whose spin-offs today benefit mainly France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, but not necessarily Lithuania, Cyprus or Malta."
"It is therefore very important that we send those countries a message."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment to the effect that we should bring astronauts from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the corps of European astronauts and that we should plan a manned flight with one such astronaut very soon in order to involve them in the conquest of space and its magic and so that they will support it."
"My final point is about US strategy."
"I do not know whether it is an opportunist strategy on Mr Bush’s part in the run-up to the election campaign."
"At any rate I am glad that Europe is in on it, but it must not for all that neglect the establishment of Soyuz in Kourou or neglect its independence in space matters."
"That is what I wanted to say to you, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mr President, we have before us a new definition of priorities and objectives."
"The White Paper talks clearly about a demand-driven space policy, while both the White Paper and the previous texts and official statements clearly indicate that the aim is to use space for military objectives."
"Some say that anyway space systems have a dual purpose: both civil and military."
"I would merely comment that the decision on one use or the other is a political decision."
"The fact that, for example, weapons exist which are capable of destroying the whole world does not mean that we will allow them to be used."
"Others say that space cannot be developed without state funding, and they are right about that, but they add that the only way to obtain such funding within the framework of competition is to develop the military side."
"I would ask them to tone down their worship of the free market and competition policy and I would counter-propose public funding for space research and exploration."
"I would also warn about the anger of the grass-roots movement if an attempt is made to use space to serve defence and security policy, a clearly aggressive policy which aims to turn the European Union into a second global policeman at the side of the United States of America."
"The new approach may serve business interests, which will profit both via market mechanisms and from state funding for military applications."
"But it does not serve anyone else."
"On the contrary, the entrance of the European Union into the military use of space is a serious escalation in the arms race, which is extremely dangerous to world peace."
"It really is a pity that man's most advanced achievements will be used against him."
"But that is an unavoidable characteristic of the capitalist system."
"We have no choice but to categorically oppose the policy to commercialise and militarise space."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the peoples of united Europe are waiting for a grand design."
"Our fellow citizens often experience Europe only through the distorting mirror of standards, rules and constraints, and we must make space exploration one of the top ambitions of European integration, an ambition that would bring our fellow citizens both pride and definite benefits in their everyday lives, like the Galileo project."
"Pursuing a grand design requires resources, however."
"And today there is not sufficient political will to give European space policy the credits it needs."
"The Commission has tried, as the White Paper shows."
"An extra 4.6% increase in space expenditure every year is good, but it is a minimum."
"The Union’s Heads of State must understand that when President Bush is ordering flights to Mars and China is successfully launching its first manned spacecraft, Europe can no longer allow itself to lag behind."
"The time has come to change gear and give a real boost to space expenditure."
"To do that, we must look to the states, through the ESA and the large national agencies, which, like the DLR in Germany or the CNES in France, have irreplaceable experience."
"But we should also go beyond the intergovernmental level."
"The draft Constitution for Europe provides for the beginnings of a Community space policy."
"I am pleased about that, provided that in return for these new prerogatives the Union becomes a new source of funding for space."
"We cannot demand new competences without assuming the cost."
"And we must at the same time continue to seek external funding."
"The cooperation with India and China through the Galileo project is an example to be followed and built upon as the opportunities arise, with the Russian Federation, for example, like France has just done with the plan to establish a Soyuz launch pad in Kourou."
"I will finish by saying that if we really do not want Europe to be excluded from the conquest of space, funding cannot remain public."
"We must lift the taboos and say clearly, as the resolution invites us to do, that the funding of space policy must be opened up to private industry."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the various matters raised by this oral question bear witness to the growing interest Parliament is showing in the establishment of a European space policy commensurate with the Union’s ambitions."
"I want to pay tribute to Parliament for its unwavering support on these matters and I want to say that it was thanks to this encouragement that the Commission launched a wide-ranging debate in Europe on the future of the space sector, a debate in which some Members of Parliament were directly involved."
"Following that debate, the Commission adopted a White Paper, some of the important actions from which are raised in your question."
"In order to develop space technology, the Commission proposes increasing public expenditure in the field, once a master plan has been drawn up setting out all the missing technologies, the players concerned and a timetable of measures."
"The sixth framework programme is already able to contribute to this field, in particular through the priority given to ‘aeronautics and space’ and to information society technologies."
"The Commission will be looking into how to continue this form of development in the next framework programme."
"So far as access to space is concerned, the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Space Agency, supports the implementation of a series of measures, including most importantly the improvement of the launching service offered from the Guiana space centre."
"This action has already been adopted as a project under the Quickstart growth initiative and was presented and adopted at the last European Council."
"Definition work on the financial arrangements has begun in liaison with the European Investment Bank."
"Multilateral talks have begun with the other space powers, which should result in the proposal of a regulatory framework that will be acceptable at international level."
"Finally, the Commission is looking into direct involvement in the maintenance of the basic terrestrial infrastructures for the future European space programme."
"So far as Galileo is concerned, the potential role of the private sector should be that of final operator following a selection procedure conducted by the Galileo joint undertaking."
"The Commission will also be entering into bilateral negotiations with India."
"And a framework agreement has just been signed between the European Community and China."
"Within the next few days, that is on 3 February, the Commission should be adopting a communication based on a detailed report drawn up with the European Space Agency and the Member States drawing the lessons from the initial phase and setting out an action plan for the ‘Global Monitoring for Environment and Security’ (GMS) initiative."
"For the launch of the subsequent deployment phase, the Commission proposes that a formal coordination structure, possibly drawing on the experience with Galileo, be progressively put in place."
"The Envisat satellite is universally admired for its environmental monitoring ability and is a marvellous example of earth observation, in the field of which we are in the vanguard of development."
"Until this structure is put in place for GMS there will be a more lightweight interim solution, as provided in the framework agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency."
"In this connection, I would like to point out the importance of Parliament’s opinion for concluding this agreement between the European Community and the ESA."
"The Commission is also drawing up a policy on access to space and launchers, for which the installation of the Soyuz launcher at the Guiana space centre is a specific example of the strategic cooperation that can be established between Russia and Europe."
"The final decision on this programme is expected to be taken at the European Space Agency’s Council meeting on 4 February."
"In the White Paper, the Commission suggests that the Union should be able to be involved in keeping launch installations operational and in funding work and research with a view to defining a future space transport system."
"Finally, in the White Paper, the Commission suggests continuing the activities connected with the international space station, because by so doing the Europeans will improve their experience in the field of prolonged stays in space."
"In this connection, I was pleased to hear Mr Savary’s suggestion, which of course concerned Europe as a whole, that astronauts from the future accession states should be involved."
"The international station may also be considered an essential intermediate stage before going on to explore the solar system."
"You mentioned President Bush’s statement."
"It requires in-depth analysis."
"It does of course have consequences that affect us given the investment agreed by the European side, in particular to keep the international station accessible to European astronauts."
"We should not therefore sell the whole process without receiving assurances that that process, to which we are very committed, will continue."
"You also know – and this gives food for thought – that the European satellite that is observing Mars has obtained remarkable results, since you have seen the photographs which show that there might be ice on the moon."
"This was achieved using European technology, even though, sadly, Beagle has not managed similar success."
"But the spectral analysis of Mars is a leading European technology of which we can be proud."
"Finally, building on that, there is also the idea of seeing how we envisage manned flights, so that we are not left out of the race towards those objectives either."
"In cooperation with the ESA, the Commission will in 2004 be setting up a group of wise men that should enable the European Union to define its position on manned space flight."
"These, in a few words, are the most important aspects."
"I am truly pleased to conclude by telling you that the Commission is including space and space research in its thinking on the future financial perspectives that are at the heart of the Commission’s debate and which Parliament will, on 10 February I think, be the first to know."
"We will be giving the first broad outlines of the financial perspectives."
"And when it comes to financial perspectives, it is clear that research and innovation programmes must have their funding increased, among other things to sustain a space policy that will be crucial for Europe’s technological progress and its place in the world."
"Thank you, Commissioner Busquin."
"To wind up the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Article 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m."
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0004/2004) to the Commission on the Communication on 'The future of the textiles and clothing sector in the enlarged European Union'."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the Commission for the communication on the future of the textile and clothing industry, which has been published at a time when the sector is very worried about the final elimination of the import quota system on 1 January 2005 in view of the competitive pressure from developing countries – countries which also have a large export capacity – which could lead to the closure of many companies and consequently to job losses."
"China is a particular worry, since in addition to its competitiveness – the result of low business costs – it has a very aggressive trade policy, and shows little respect for the rules governing international trade."
"Recent studies indicate job losses in the European Union in the order of 40-60% by 2010 depending on the sector."
"If we add to this the fact that the European textile and clothing industry is concentrated in certain regions, with a predominantly female labour force, you will realise the gravity of the situation, and the urgent need for decisive action on the part of public administrations at all levels if the sector is to be successful in meeting the challenges it now faces."
"Obviously, the primary responsibility lies with the business directors who are responsible for defining strategies and making the investments needed in these new circumstances, but it is equally true that public authorities have an obligation to ensure that operating conditions are conducive to development."
"Clearly the industry’s future will include a reassessment of the sector’s comparative advantages: the quality of goods, design, the fashion factor, and, above all, the sector’s capacity for innovation and for developing new hi-tech products, especially intelligent fabrics and industrial fabrics."
"There will also be a phase of considering the opportunities for moving into the international market."
"This is why the measures proposed in the Commission’s communication are so welcome, because they address this very issue."
"For this reason, I am also very pleased that Commissioner Busquin is with us today, given the importance of research and development if the sector is to emerge victorious in the future."
"The problem is when and how to implement the measures detailed in the communication."
"It is all very well to analyse the sector’s problems and to determine how best to resolve them, but funding also needs to be set aside for the measures, which include creating a specific regional assistance programme for the sector which does not qualify as state aid and for providing training for workers to help them adapt to the changing labour market."
"This also needs to be combined with an action plan and with the adoption of a firm timetable so that activities can get under way before the end of 2004 and above all, before it is too late."
"We also need a firm commitment from the Commission that it will not reduce the trade policy measures it is proposing to put a stop to unfair competition, and to high duties, peak tariffs and non-tariff barriers which make market access so difficult."
"Commissioner, the future of the sector and the continued existence of thousands of jobs are in your hands."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for joining us for this debate on the problems in the textile and clothing industry."
"There is no doubt that this debate is taking place, among other reasons, because of the Commission’s communication on the textile industry in the context of an enlarged Europe, for which I want to thank the Commission."
"The communication proposes a whole range of measures to assist the sector in its efforts to define a strategy in view of the new market challenges and, in particular, in view of the end of import quotas from 1 January 2005."
"Some recent and imminent events, such as China joining the WTO and the elimination of quotas and duties for certain products, are forcing the industry to take steps to resolve problems rapidly."
"In my opinion, some of the measures proposed in the communication are urgently needed."
"Firstly, it is important to have both Community and national policies that encourage SMEs to invest directly in research and development activities, and in innovation, as an essential means of incorporating new production processes, of encouraging creativity and fashion, and as a result, increasing the sector’s ability to compete on the global market."
"I have to say that such matters merit consideration. A short while ago, Commissioner Busquin talked to me about these initiatives – initiatives such as creating support offices for SMEs to help them obtain intellectual property rights protection for brand names, designs and patents."
"Secondly, I would say that we need to obtain agreements within the WTO whereby certain countries which are our rivals or which have zero duty access to our markets, or at least very low levels of duty, are required to reduce their current high duty levels as an essential part of trade liberalisation."
"Finally, it is very important that the Commission implement the proposed measures on protecting intellectual property rights."
"Third countries must respect these rights, and it is also essential that we monitor compliance with the APIC agreements, if we are to combat piracy and counterfeiting."
"I do hope that the rapid approval of the Directive on enforcing intellectual property rights, and the revision of the customs regulation, will become key instruments in protecting this industrial property which is so important for so many sectors, including textiles."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by thanking Commissioner Busquin for coming here today. I should also like to express my appreciation for the high quality of the Commission Communication on the future of the textile industry in an enlarged Europe."
"We are still very concerned, however, and many questions remain unanswered."
"I shall now highlight some, as raised by Mrs Ferrer."
"How will the Commission translate proposals into specific actions?"
"What timetable does it envisage and what budget does it intend to use for implementing these measures?"
"Commissioner Lamy’s optimistic words, regarding the textiles and clothing industry, come to mind at this point. He classified it as a sector with a future in the European Union and of major importance for the European agenda for trade."
"Commissioner Lamy recently said that ‘by 2005 import quotas will have been abolished, but our commitment to the industry will not waver’."
"We have to address current and future challenges, while resolutely guaranteeing jobs in the sector."
"It is essential to promote companies’ competitiveness through innovation, flexible production practices and by providing the current workforce in the industry with vocational training and further education."
"I should like to highlight some of the points in the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer:"
"- firstly: the vital role of structural funds."
"I endorse the request to establish, within the financial framework of the structural funds, a specific regional initiative for the sector in order to address the difficulties that will arise in 2005 and to adapt the workers to the new demands of the employment market;"
"- secondly: creating a textiles and clothing monitoring centre."
"This will make it possible to analyse the development of trade between China and the EU and to ensure compliance with the rules in force in both regions."
"Assuming that the Commission agrees, when could such a monitoring centre be created?"
"- thirdly: bilateral trade agreements."
"All of the EU’s bilateral trade agreements must incorporate the principle of corporate social responsibility, compliance with the fundamental rights laid down by the International Labour Organisation and sustainable development."
"Mr President, these are indeed challenging times for the European Union’s textile and clothing industry."
"In that context, I am delighted to welcome the Commission’s communication on this matter."
"The region I represent, the East Midlands, has the largest cluster of clothing companies in the United Kingdom and has the second largest clothing and textile industry in Europe."
"Many of my constituents working in this industry have been made redundant time after time and they see manufacturing moving to the low-wage economies of developing countries."
"It is understandable that to these workers, who are still in such vulnerable positions, protectionist measures seem an attractive proposition."
"However, in the long term this is not the way to deal with the problems facing the industry today."
"In today’s global economy the EU is never going to be able to compete on price alone and nor should it."
"The EU should maximise the advantages of well-trained workers who are motivated, skilled and experienced."
"We have succeeded in this industry in the past and we can continue to do so in the future."
"There are different, innovative ways to face the challenges of increasing global competition."
"For some businesses EU funding has proved to be an important tool in boosting competitiveness."
"The East Midlands Textile Association runs numerous projects – funded through the European Regional Development Fund – which assist companies: projects such as MAS, which helps small businesses in the region to branch out into new markets, or the Business ICT Bureau, which provides an expert source of ICT help specific to the needs of the textile sector."
"These are good examples of how funding is being used to help establish networks between local organisations working in the same area."
"While funding programmes are beneficial, they are also short-term in nature."
"I know that work is being done to ensure that maximum long-term economic benefit will be gained by harnessing the East Midlands textile cluster."
"For other businesses the answer may be to look towards technical textiles, ranging from specialist heat- and chemical-resistant materials to flight socks designed to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis."
"I should like to raise a note of caution here."
"For some companies the correct response to the challenges is to look to the high-tech field, but it is not an option available to everyone."
"It would be easy to say that companies are resistant to change."
"If you look at small organisations with just a few employees and tight profit margins it is much more difficult for those companies to make the significant investment in research that will come more easily to the bigger players."
"My final point is that the head office of the trade union, KFAT, is in Leicester, my home town."
"That union has informed the debate about the future of the textile industry."
"I, like the industry, the trade unions and those who work in it, look forward to the implementation of the Commission’s proposals."
"Mr President, it is well known that the textiles and clothing industry still has a considerable presence in the enlarged EU, employing around 2.7 million people, mainly women, even after shedding some 850 000 jobs and losing many thousands of businesses between 1990 and 2001."
"Consequently, the threatened total abolition of import quotas next 1 January may seriously hamper development and exacerbate unemployment, especially in areas with the highest concentration of textiles and clothing companies, such as the North and Beiras regions of Portugal."
"There is currently a serious problem of multinationals relocating; in my home town of Vila Nova de Gaia, for example, there is a German company, Brax Portugal, threatening to close down within days and to lay off 450 workers, mainly women."
"This is a serious problem that is repeated more or less throughout Portugal."
"It must be borne in mind that the textiles and clothing industry is of major strategic importance to the EU with great prospects for the future, and that it can make a major contribution towards promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"It may also, however, cause serious unemployment and hamper development unless we adopt appropriate measures to ensure that such problems do not arise in the future."
"Hence the proposals that we have tabled, promoting the interests of the production sector, given that a cohesive whole depends on all parts of the chain. The aim is to ensure the survival both of mid-range products and of those with a high added value, and to guarantee job prospects."
"It is therefore essential that the Commission present a concrete, cohesive and clearly defined action plan, in terms of instruments, financial resources and timetable. Particular attention should be paid in such an action plan to encouraging innovation and using new technology in the sector, to strengthening interaction between the various sectors of the industry, to carrying out an extensive programme of vocational training, to modernising and strengthening support for small and medium-sized enterprises and to protecting the environment."
"A Community programme must also be established, with suitable support mechanisms, especially for those less-favoured regions that depend on the sector."
"A sectoral approach must also be adopted for the textiles and clothing sector, specifically within the framework of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation."
"– Mr President, next year will see radical change in the textile sector, when quotas are abolished after over 30 years."
"The import tariffs in the European Union now rank among the lowest in the world."
"That requires comparable market liberalisation on the part of other countries that have large textile sectors and markets."
"The rapporteur and Commissioner Lamy are rightly committed to this."
"Secondly, following the abolition of quantitative restrictions, there will be the temptation to adopt alternative ways of restricting imports for protectionist reasons: anti-dumping measures and safeguard clauses, for example."
"How does the Commissioner intend to prevent this?"
"Non-tariff barriers, such as unnecessary bureaucratic import procedures, also need to be reduced."
"My third point concerns labelling and certification. As the rapporteur acknowledges, these are essential for the protection of core labour and environmental standards."
"What specific steps does the Commissioner envisage to give more substance to these, particularly with regard to the means of production?"
"By way of conclusion, I should like to make an observation about the trading position of developing countries, which requires not merely access to the European market; the European Union must also stop dumping cotton, which interferes with the market in raw materials."
"Providing EUR 900 million per annum in export subsidies to European cotton farmers is not conducive to a better price on the world market."
"The result is that the world price for a bale of cotton has fallen by half since 1990."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome these initiatives, in both the oral question and the legislative resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and to say that we will support them, along with certain other initiatives tabled by fellow Members on the issue."
"Ours is a vote in favour of placing greater emphasis on free, equal and fair trade, and on respect for the principle of reciprocity in international trade relations, which, as is well documented, is not currently respected, particularly in the textiles and clothing sector."
"We also believe that it is essential to pay greater attention to the case of China, treating it with objectivity and realism."
"A mere monitoring centre will not be sufficient. Clear measures must be implemented to combat China’s hegemony in terms of the international trade in textiles and clothing."
"China already accounts for almost 25% of world textile production, an alarming figure, particularly for genuine developing countries such as Bangladesh or Vietnam, which may also be crushed by the Chinese steamroller in this sector."
"We feel that, in view of its considerable muscle in this industry, China can no longer be considered a developing country. Otherwise we run the risk of killing the textiles and clothing industry everywhere else in the world."
"Finally, still on the question of access to markets, we feel that it would have been useful if the resolution had mentioned – it is too late at this juncture – the need to implement a series of practical actions in the area of trade, to be developed by business, with the aim of penetrating new markets."
"It would be essential to establish support mechanisms to take part in trade fairs, to open sales outlets and distribution platforms, and to carry out prospecting missions of target markets, etc. These are measures that we have submitted to the Commission for consideration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the industrial revolution in England in the latter part of the eighteenth century started in the textile industry."
"This sector has a pioneering history, an active present and a future full of challenges and uncertainties."
"The European textiles industry is today threatened by competition from countries where prices for goods are extremely low and where there are no environmental concerns or constraints."
"Exploitation of labour, particularly of child labour, reminds us of the wretched conditions that marked our own industrial revolution."
"Yet the textiles industry continues to survive, modernise and renew itself. It is the point where industry, craft and art converge, and it plays a major role in people’s lifestyles."
"The neo-liberal dogmas that had previously held back the EU, fearful of a de-industrialised Europe, from adopting an industrial policy, are now obsolete. European decision-makers can now see what is happening and can take a stand in defence of the textile and clothing industry."
"The Commission communication is therefore most welcome, albeit over-long. We also support the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer, containing the essential elements of a European policy for the sector."
"Since trade policy falls within the exclusive competence of the EU, it is of vital importance that the Commission does not turn the textiles and clothing sector into a bargaining chip to win concessions in other areas deemed more appealing."
"To do so would be pitifully short-sighted and ethically reprehensible."
"On the other hand, the negotiators of the Doha Agenda for development must fight for conditions of access to markets of third countries that are equitable, requiring in particular that they comply with the principle of reciprocity and open up new markets."
"Portugal, as we all know, is a country in which jobs and economic and social cohesion depend a great deal on the textiles and clothing sector. It is therefore highly sensitive to the downturns and slumps of this industry."
"Some highly industrialised regions of Portugal are even experiencing economic crisis, as we speak."
"The Commission must therefore back up its words with action."
"Mr President, it is quite opportune that I am the last speaker, as I want to add a note of optimism to the debate, which until now has been rather gloomy."
"I appreciate that these are challenging times for the textile industry."
"I appreciate too that we are running into a new era where import controls will be different and a new sector will be joining our textile industry."
"But, to inject a note of optimism, just as I said in the debate in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, one has only to look at the jackets and suits we are all wearing and ask where they were made."
"I will tell you where they were made: in Europe."
"This jacket that I am wearing was made by Crombie, a local textile firm in my town in England; it is a good, English suit."
"I do not know where the cloth came from, but it was the skills of British workers and those of the textile industry in Europe that took a low-quality commodity product and transformed it into a high-quality, high-value product – that is the future for the textile industry."
"Different parts of the textile industry will find different routes, some more technical than others, some craft-related; some will go in other directions."
"That is the future for our industry."
"This should be the message going out to the industry from the Commission White Paper."
"We must be sure that when the Commission acts, our textile and clothing sector – much of it being made up of small companies – is able to invest in new technology and production techniques."
"It must be able to find ways to add value to the basic products that we may be importing from elsewhere."
"We must also – and this is a point which has not been previously mentioned – protect our industry from counterfeiting."
"This has become increasingly vital."
"Counterfeiting is a very serious issue for high-value, quality products, and is an issue we must address."
"I see no reference to this at all in the White Paper."
"Finally, if we get it right for the textile industry, we can learn some very important lessons for other industrial sectors."
"We should also be looking at leather goods and footwear, and using textiles as an industrial sector flagship that can lead the way in this new century, with European workers able to earn a living from producing high-value, quality products."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares your concerns about this question and is taking the necessary steps to deal with them."
"In view of these major challenges that face us in the textiles and clothing sector and which will remain for some years to come, in particular, as you have stressed, the effect of abolishing import quotas on 1 January 2005, the Commission has re-examined its policies and instruments in order to identify measures or lines of action that might make the textiles and clothing sector more competitive."
"These are reflected in the communication to which you have drawn attention, the one on the future of the textiles and clothing sector adopted by the Commission on 29 October 2003 and welcomed at a Council meeting on competitiveness on 27 November 2003."
"As you know, the Union’s strategy for international trade and for Doha is to seek reciprocity for textiles and clothing."
"Together, these policies and measures seek to give the industry and those working in the sector a clear, predictable and coherent framework that will make it easy to plan strategies and investments in the medium and long term."
"The Commission welcomes the support for these initiatives and ideas contained in the resolution on the future of the textiles sector that Parliament will shortly be adopting."
"The Commission will look closely at the new ideas mentioned in the text of the resolution."
"Some of the recommendations contained in the communication could be followed by concrete proposals within a relatively short space of time."
"For the rest, some of the communication’s ideas and suggestions require further investigation before being translated into action."
"In order to assist the Commission in these investigations and in following up these matters, it will be putting in place a high level group whose task will be to formulate recommendations for improving the conditions of competitiveness."
"The purpose of this high level group will be to contribute to the process of implementing industrial and commercial policies in the textiles and clothing sector of the enlarged Union."
"The group will be involved in the Commission services’ regular monitoring of the sector’s economic development."
"It will provide reports and recommendations to the Commission and other players taking decisions on the proposed initiative in order to help the sector adjust to the various challenges facing it."
"Those reports will have to include recommendations on the key issues affecting competition in the sector."
"The high level group will be made up of commissioners, ministers, heads of undertakings and directors general or presidents of federations involved in the textiles and clothing sector."
"It will look after innovation, research and development."
"I was pleased that you stressed the role of research and development in this respect."
"In fact, I recently had the opportunity to visit a textile undertaking which has made considerable efforts in research and innovation and has become competitive on the Chinese market as a result, although it was in a difficult position a few years ago."
"With a much more effective patent on dyeing and more mechanisms for managing productivity, it has become competitive in a very precise niche."
"The services also tell us that exports to China increase when there are these new industrial capacities."
"It is therefore clear that there is a future when we develop this research and innovation in a field where we have know-how."
"Another topic is the question of intellectual property."
"Mr Berenguer Fuster is quite right when he says that this question must clearly form the basis of our thinking on the international level because these new processes can all be fragile if we do not protect them with solid patents."
"Research and development is certainly an important factor."
"We are also considering setting up a technology platform on the textiles sector, with the main players."
"The other subjects are education and training, and regional policy."
"You stressed the problem of the Structural Funds in this connection, Mrs Bastos."
"In proposing the new mechanisms for the Structural Funds, my colleague Mr Barnier says very clearly that they will have to make an even greater contribution than in the past to the process of growth, the ‘Lisbon’ process."
"In sectors like textiles, the next Structural Funds will attach greater priority and importance to research, innovation and training, if that is what the regions want, of course."
"International cooperation, labelling and other commerce-related subjects may all have an effect on the impact."
"This high level group will start work in February 2004, that is virtually tomorrow, looking in particular at the objectives and the expected results, and will be followed by at least two plenary sessions before July 2004."
"The Commission will present its first report on the group’s work to the Council in July 2004."
"I think proper account is being taken of the problem."
"The European institutions and the Member States will be kept informed of the group’s work and of the implementation of its conclusions."
"The Commission is aware of the need to move quickly, since it wants to implement all of it before the end of 2004."
"By the end of February the Commission will draw up a list of the various trade proposals, measures and actions resulting from the communication, giving a timetable for their implementation."
"This will be shared with Parliament and the Member States."
"You also mentioned, Mrs Bastos, the question of the budget to be used for the implementation of the measures proposed in the Commission communication."
"Our intention is to use existing Community programmes and investments to implement the specific measures adopted, since we have to move quickly."
"Each specific measure will be implemented by the appropriate Commission services responsible for the field in question, using its own budget."
"I can tell you that the field of research and calls for proposals under the framework programme offer potential for interesting projects and I think that also applies in other sectors."
"I believe I have demonstrated how interested the Commission and Parliament are in this strategic sector for our economy."
"Thank you very much Commissioner Busquin."
"To wind up the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Article 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.(2)"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0480/2003) by Mr Laschet, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and the United Nations (2003/2049(INI))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what do the European Union and the United Nations have in common?"
"Why has Parliament produced a report on the subject?"
"Is there nothing more pressing?"
"Does a parliament really have to look at every single subject, even at those that are not particularly high on the agenda?"
"That was what people said in 2002, when it was first suggested that Parliament should produce a report on the relationship between the European Union and the United Nations."
"We had hardly had any political debates about the relationship between the two institutions – there were seven lines in reports of European Council meetings when at some point in the text there was a passing reference to the United Nations; and the only active institution was the Commission which, in the quiet, calm, effective manner familiar to all of us, paid 60% of the budget for development programmes for humanitarian aid."
"Of course, there were no major political implications or demands involved: it was very effective, but not related to any political message."
"Then came the Iraq crisis, during which the US President described the UN as irrelevant."
"That was when Parliament began to say that this was perhaps an interesting subject after all, that we wanted to make relations between the European Union and the United Nations more political in nature, and that we wanted to produce a report in order to ask the other institutions to consider introducing more politics in our relations with the United Nations."
"Today, nearly one year after Parliament made that decision, we can now say that the United Nations is not irrelevant."
"Even the most powerful country in the world has realised that the legitimacy of the United Nations is needed in order to rebuild a state, to establish democracy and to create a nation."
"Here in Europe, the Commission issued a very significant communication in September – a political communication first and foremost – which defined relations between the European institutions, and also their future, in terms of a European Constitution."
"The Council is also much more active nowadays in seeking agreement with the United Nations, and I believe that today’s visit to this House by the Secretary-General of the United Nations marks the start of greater political cooperation."
"What, then, are the main subjects we need to discuss?"
"One should be today’s message: the fact that the European Parliament is speaking out in favour of multilateralism."
"Not because, as Robert Kagan once claimed, the European Union favours multilateralism only because it is incapable of acting unilaterally."
"No, that is not the reason."
"Our reason is that the European Union is multilateral in structure and in nature."
"The horrific wars in the twentieth century taught us that multilateral cooperation is the right way to build a peaceful and just future, and the lesson we have learnt in the European Union holds true for the United Nations too – that is why we favour a multilateral approach."
"This is the message that Parliament should send out today, and if we do so, if we want to play our part in the world, then we have to start by doing our homework."
"The Heads of State and Government did not do that in December, because the tasks included creating a legal status for the European Union to put an end to the situation whereby the Commission can go over the Community’s head because it is a member of the FAO, with a seat and vote, and whereby in political matters, we have no legal personality in Nairobi, Geneva or Vienna and so cannot act."
"The European Union needs a legal personality."
"We also need a European Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will have to bring together our policies with those of the Council and the Commission and represent us all internationally."
"That means we need a European Union representative at the UN offices, not a Commission office, a Council office and an office for the Presidency."
"No, we need a representative for foreign affairs, and that is what Parliament is proposing."
"We should also continue discussions after Kofi Annan’s visit."
"We need the Commission to produce an annual report that will get Parliament discussing the political priorities in order to establish how to proceed, what we have achieved and what we have not achieved."
"We need clarity in the budget, so that we know which institutions, agencies, and funds receive money from us, and which do not."
"I think, too, that Jean Monnet’s comment – that Europe should help make a better world – ties in very well with Kofi Annan’s message at the last General Assembly, where he said that the United Nations makes the world a better place."
"That we are combining the two today is ideal, and means that today is very significant both for Europe and for the United Nations."
". Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss relations between the European Union and the United Nations, and I want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of his report."
"Nobody who knows the honourable Member will be surprised that it is really an outstanding and sensible piece of work."
"I would also like to stress at the outset that the Commission is obviously ready to enter into a more regular dialogue with the Parliament on relations between us and the United Nations."
"It is important for both the Commission and the Parliament to have such an exchange of views on such an important subject."
"It is only when Parliament, Council and Commission – and indeed the Member States – work well together that the European Union collectively can deliver the support that is needed for the UN system."
"As the honourable Member said, the timing of the report is extremely appropriate."
"The Iraq crisis has, in many ways, served as a wake-up call for us all on the essential role of the UN in questions of peace and security."
"The Union is an important partner of the UN and we should stand by our commitment to effective multilateralism."
"The full support of the House for this endeavour is important and I welcome it, especially on the day that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan will address the Parliament."
"The full Commission had the great privilege and pleasure of spending two-and-a-half hours talking to him yesterday."
"The Commission set out its views on the subject in a communication of 10 September 2003, entitled 'The Choice of Multilateralism'."
"The purpose of the communication was threefold."
"First and foremost, it was to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and the UN."
"Second, it was to demonstrate the manner in which we implement this commitment in our daily work."
"The paper provides an impressive inventory of the extensive cooperation between the EU and the UN that is already taking place, and of our support for UN activities on a wide number of issues, ranging from conflict prevention to development aid and from crisis management to poverty reduction."
"Whilst the issues of peace and security that are dealt with by the Security Council attract most of the media attention, it would be a mistake to focus our attention and support only on those questions."
"Third, we identify a large number of practical actions to improve our internal coordination on UN questions in the UN bodies themselves, in Brussels and also in the Member States, with the overall aim of enhancing our influence in the UN, and in an attempt to assist it more effectively."
"In response to this communication, the Council recently agreed on a set of comprehensive conclusions on EU-UN relations that provides a good platform for our future work."
"This debate takes place at a time when the Union is looking for an enhanced role on the international stage."
"Witness to this are not only the proposals of the Convention to streamline the CFSP and the EU’s external action more generally – and here I note in particular the proposal to let the proposed foreign minister speak on behalf of the Union in the Security Council whenever there is a common EU position – but also the European security strategy with its leading theme of effective multilateralism."
"The European Union should be ready to stand up for its belief in the importance of the United Nations."
"I think that Parliament’s report represents an additional strong signal of support from the European Union at this challenging moment for the UN."
"After the Iraq crisis many in the international community have made great efforts to find our way back towards collective action, including renewed UN engagement in Iraq."
"Of course, it is not enough to keep referring to multilateralism over and over again as though it was some mantra."
"We need to think seriously and creatively about the kinds of results we want to obtain from multilateral organisations and instruments."
"How can we improve their effectiveness in dealing with the threats and challenges that the world is facing?"
"These include poverty reduction, weapons of mass destruction, failed states, international crime, terrorism, climate change."
"And how best can we contribute to that endeavour?"
"All these goals are addressed by the Parliament’s report and there is a broad meeting of minds with the Commission’s own communication on the subject."
"It is clear that our common starting point is the belief that the UN system is the key to safeguarding international security in the largest sense of that term."
"Whether we are looking at the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in checking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or whether we are looking at global targets for poverty reduction and sustainable development, I hardly need to underline the importance of the so-called soft issues for the wider security agenda."
"Development and security are inextricably linked and mutually dependent."
"It is in this perspective that we should support the work of the high-level panel on UN reform established by the Secretary-General last year."
"The European Union should provide an input to this process and I welcome the intention of the Council presidency to work on the submission of an EU contribution."
"The Commission will participate actively in this exercise."
"Finally, as regards the European Union’s own internal coordination and operations of the UN, I am pleased to see that the Commission’s analysis and recommendations are very much in line with those that are presented in the honourable Member’s admirable report."
"As for the creation and subsequent implementation of multilateral instruments, the Commission shares the report’s opinion that the European Union should play a leading role and assist third countries in fulfilling their obligations, as we have done, for example, in relation to counter-terrorism."
"Parliament could in this context use its cooperation with third countries to address these kinds of issues and in that way help to build bridges between North and South."
"Let me conclude by commending the report to the House and by underlining as well the Commission’s determination to work closely with the Parliament, with the Council and with the UN to implement the recommendations that are contained in it."
"– Mr President, by honouring Kofi Annan and receiving this report on cooperation between the European Union and United Nations, the European Parliament has, today, clearly declared its support for multilateralism in international relations and indicated that we see cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations as an essential part of conflict resolution."
"We want to strengthen the European Union and also the United Nations, both of which have been weakened by the debate over whether and how to intervene in Iraq."
"Since the European Union is preparing to create its own Minister for Foreign Affairs, it should ensure that the role has plenty of substance to it."
"The road to a common foreign and security policy will also undoubtedly lead to greater cooperation between the EU and the UN."
"We are currently a global player, providing over half of all contributions to the United Nations and over 60% of total international development aid, but we should move on to become a global player capable of taking a leading role in this critical phase of the United Nations’ development and helping to shape the UN of the future."
"Strengthening cooperation between the EU and the UN should and can have a positive effect in developing multilateralism. It can and should also affect all activities undertaken by the two organisations: the fight against terrorism, conflict prevention, human rights, crisis management, environmental protection and weapons of mass destruction."
"This would clearly demonstrate the reality of cooperation, and in practical terms, would lead to the implementation of the EU’s Millennium Objectives, which were established in 2000."
"If we are to do this, the EU must have more influence within the United Nations."
"UN-specific elements can be included at all levels of the European Union, and it seems appropriate for the European Parliament to be included in the process."
"Precisely because the idea of the EU speaking with one voice in the United Nations Security Council still seems somewhat idealistic, multilateral instruments and commitments should be used to boost the EU’s role and profile within the United Nations."
"Perhaps one way to move ahead would be to produce a concrete proposal on compliance with the treaty on weapons of mass destruction and the UN Security Council’s role in ensuring it."
"Mr President, addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said, and I quote: ‘The last twelve months have been very painful for those of us who believe in collective answers to our common problems and challenges’."
"It was a time when many voices in the political world, in the media and a large proportion of public opinion believed that the United Nations was failing in some way."
"Subsequent developments, in Iraq in particular, have demonstrated that things are never simple, and the current situation can be described by means of the lyrics of a Spanish song which say ‘neither with you nor without you is there any relief for my pain’."
"There is no such relief either the United Nations – which demonstrated, not in Iraq, but in relation to previous terrible crises, in Rwanda for example, its powerlessness to prevent tragic outcomes – or the United Nations, as demonstrated at the moment by this ridiculous impasse of an intervention which has no political solution in a country such as Iraq."
"Our group's position on the Laschet report has been one of broad agreement, with the emphasis on certain fundamental aspects."
"The first is a strong commitment to principles and values."
"In response to the idiotic criticism of those people who believe this to be idealism, we could reply that values are interests."
"In our societies and in the whole world, the application of principles and values is our principal interest."
"While, moreover, we are talking about lesser interests, we can state that the material contribution of the European Union and its countries is so great and so disproportionate to its political weight within the UN system that the European Union is obliged to commit itself to making progress towards a modification of the current state of affairs."
"There are two ways of doing this: one is the establishment of a common and strong European Union foreign and defence policy; the other is to make progress towards a European Union presence on the Security Council in a positive way and on the basis of speeding up the current constitution-building process, which ensures that the voice of its peoples, by means of their representatives, are respected by governments and that we establish as soon as possible a European Constitution which allows us to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name."
"– Mr President, the new world order both requires a stronger United Nations and, at the same time, hinders its coming into being."
"More than ever, major world problems require a global approach, which entails effective decision-making and implementation."
"The UN should undergo a thorough overhaul in order to reflect the new relationships and to carry out the many tasks in an adequate manner."
"Everyone here is agreed on this, yet nothing is being done because everyone has a different opinion on how it should be."
"It is hypocritical to embrace the UN millennium declaration if we are subsequently not prepared to act on it and stick our necks out for it."
"UN reforms are not only technical, but often involve a redistribution of power, and that is where things are going continually wrong."
"For example, the reform of the Security Council has been the subject of squabbles for more than ten years, with no results so far."
"The United States is by far the most powerful player on the world stage and has little need of multilateralism, which it regards as a restriction of its power."
"Other countries, including France and the United Kingdom, refuse to relinquish the privileges they have inherited from the old world order."
"Potential permanent members do not grant each other favoured positions."
"Permanent seats for continents only work if the regional powers can agree on a rotation mechanism."
"The proposed double veto system is better than what we have at the moment, but offers no real solution, especially not if the number of permanent seats is being increased still further."
"Instead of this, it would be preferable to use a European model of differential vote weighting, and hence to abolish the veto system."
"I do not believe that the European Union's political coordination in the UN is as bad as Mr Laschet suggests in his excellent report."
"Generally, there is most definitely EU consensus in the General Assembly."
"Despite this, Europe appears hopelessly divided in major crises, such as over Iraq."
"In my opinion, this is mainly attributable to the increased rivalry between France, the United Kingdom and Germany."
"A legal entity, or even an EU minister, will be unable to create common foreign policy as long as the big European states continue to fight for EU leadership."
"The Laschet report contains many interesting recommendations for building up relations between the European Union and the UN."
"Some are very valuable, but there are perhaps too many for the short term."
"We have to be careful not to create another UN-EU bureaucracy."
"In my opinion, the main role of our Parliament is in the area of monitoring and not so much in the diplomatic arena."
"The enlarged European Union can, and must, make a substantial contribution to the desperately needed reforms of the United Nations."
"Political necessity is beyond dispute; what is still lacking is the political courage to give shape to the new world order within the UN in a decisive manner."
"Mr President, for a pluralist assembly such as ours today is a great day, both because of the very well-produced report by Mr Laschet in which all types of suggestion have been accepted, and because of the presence of the Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan, in order to receive the Sakharov Prize, which represents a strengthening of International Law as the only way to resolve conflicts internationally."
"Our group does not have an homogeneous opinion on the report by Mr Laschet – although I recognise that the contributions made have been accepted – since our positions range from favourable to sceptical, as befits a pluralist group."
"Nevertheless, I would like to point out that we attach great importance to this report, as well as to the contributions made by the Commission to improving the international panorama, and we are clearly in favour of multilateralism – as I have said previously – although we believe that the situation puts excessive emphasis on anti-terrorist aspects and does not give sufficient emphasis to better international cooperation aimed at eliminating the causes of inequality and injustice, such as the democratic control by the UN of agencies such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank which, at the end of the day, are the bodies which can create greater justice in the world."
"That is why, in view of the need to improve relations between the European Union and the UN, which is key to creating a panorama in which there is respect for human rights and international legislation, we believe we should have gone a little further in terms of improving the conditions for greater justice in the world."
"That is why our position on Mr Laschet’s report is going to be divided into several different positions."
"– Mr President, the paradox of the UN is that whilst universal human rights are its essential strength, its Charter is firmly built on the sovereignty of states."
"The weakness of the European Union lies in the fact that it has been incapable of integrating the sovereignties of its Member States in a way that would have led to consistent respect for human rights and a foreign and security policy which is genuinely based on global multilateralism."
"Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union has often proved very unsatisfactory in this regard."
"Of course there are exceptions, as exemplified by the support for the UN International Criminal Court."
"The 2001 action programme against torture, on the other hand, has been very much a case of empty rhetoric."
"The EU in this way is still a creation of the Cold War, merely searching for its identity and role in the world."
"In the absence of a strategy, tactics become the strategy, and action is taken on an basis."
"It is partly for that reason that the EU has less muscle in the UN than its importance and contribution might warrant."
"The Commission’s UN communication from the autumn and the recently published document ‘The Enlarging EU at the UN’, as well as the report now before us contain a lot of useful information and many interesting proposals."
"It is not enough, however."
"Our historic duty is now to take responsibility for creating a more sustainable world order which would cover everything from a cooperation-based security model to the prevention of climate change."
"Cooperation within the UN and its many special bodies is vitally important."
"I might mention, for example, the social norms in respect of human rights and the environment for multinational and other companies adopted by the UN’s Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights and similar minimum guarantees for loans for development projects drawn up by the World Bank’s International Financial Cooperation."
"Unless we can correct the worst distortions of globalisation our Community of values too will prove to be nothing more than a façade."
"We will all then be the losers."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is really too much!"
"On the very day on which we are discussing this report and when we will be receiving Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General and Sakharov Prize-winner in 2003, Parliament has received depressing news from the Jurassic Park of dictatorships: we are being prevented from receiving Oswaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2002."
"This authoritarian ban by Fidel Castro’s communist regime in Cuba, which brings to mind the worst excesses of the Nazis and the Stalinists in the twentieth century, draws attention to an important part of this report, which states that, as regards the United Nations and its reform, the European Union and others must succeed in placing human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms at the top of the world agenda, with all the consequences suggested in paragraph 19."
"Oswaldo Payá’s situation is a scandal, as is the hostile gesture the Cuban regime has directed at this Parliament."
"It would be even more scandalous if nothing were said publicly about these scandals."
"We are sure that, through Kofi Annan, Parliament will send a powerful message to Cuba and that, in the form of a permanent open invitation to Oswaldo Payá, we will continue to express our active solidarity with the winner of the Sakharov Prize 2002 and with all Cuban democrats."
"I wish lastly to express my appreciation of some of the rapporteur’s amendments, namely Amendment No 8, which draws attention to the importance of the Convention on human cloning and to the Costa Rican initiative, which we must support."
"– Mr President, this report by Mr Laschet aims to propel humanity in the direction of world government of some kind."
"Only in this way does it appear possible to create peace, welfare and justice with the UN as central, vital and decisive pivot."
"Multilateralism is being embraced as the new political gospel."
"Is this pipe dream not based on a huge overestimation of the human race?"
"After all, people like you and I are prone to evil of all kinds. True peace and justice do not ensue from people."
"They can only be obtained by a true belief in God, by an unconditional surrender to His will, and, by His grace, obeying His healing Commandments enshrined in the Bible, God's Word."
"Jesus Christ underwent the punishment that brings us true peace."
"It is because that point is all too readily forgotten that I should like to start by bringing it to your attention."
"In keeping with his eminent introduction, the rapporteur considers cooperation between the European Union and the UN a cornerstone of EU foreign policy."
"In the institutionally reformed UN of the future, he more or less already assumes that the EU would be a future legal entity."
"The EU's future Foreign Affairs Minister will, on the basis of the future European Constitution, need to fulfil the future mandate on behalf of the EU."
"In addition, the Security Council will need to be extended to include permanent members, one for each continent, except for Australia, which is odd."
"Why is this enormous continent being excluded?"
"For fear of double vetoes, no doubt?"
"Instead of Great Britain and France, it is the EU that is to represent Europe."
"To describe the situation in this manner is extremely premature, to say the least."
"The EU has no constitution, is not a legal entity in the UN and there is no mandated European Foreign Affairs Minister."
"Moreover, the recent past has acutely demonstrated that both in the IGC and in the Security Council, European unity seems to be further away than ever."
"That is why it will not work, and so I would urge Members to support Amendments Nos 1 and 10 and, in doing so, to come back down to earth."
"I would like to finish off by making two remarks."
"First of all, only once – in paragraph 17, second indent in brackets – is there any reference to NATO, which has been proven to be the most effective transatlantic organisation for security."
"You know as well as I do that when the chips are down, we prefer to see our guarantee of security in the hands of a reliable and determined NATO and will never hand it over to an ever-doubting, often indecisive and divided, UN Security Council."
"NATO is a better cornerstone for the EU's foreign and security policy than the UN."
"Finally, multilateralism is good but never unconditional."
"Too often have we seen it used as a cloak under which national states look only after their own interests."
"Mr President, it can be assumed that the Laschet report was driven by good intentions: to reinforce the role of the United Nations and increase Europe’s influence in it."
"It has to be recognised, however, that the proposed method runs counter to these two objectives."
"Articles 10 and 12, the core of the resolution, propose to expand the Security Council and to weaken the current veto system by replacing it with a requirement for a double veto, when the subject is the fundamental issue of threats to peace, chapter 7."
"This challenges the two fundamental rules governing the effectiveness of the system: the limited number of members and the veto incentive available to each permanent member."
"As regards Europe’s influence, it is difficult to see how halving the number of permanent members in the Security Council could strengthen it."
"This, however, is what is implied by the proposal to make the European Union a permanent member, ‘as soon as its legal personality is recognised’."
"This seat, of which there could only ever be one, would be occupied by the infamous European Minister for Foreign Affairs who would, incidentally, no longer have, on his own, the right of veto."
"Complicating and weakening the current system seem, therefore, to be the dual characteristics of the proposal put to us."
"It is the Community method applied to the United Nations."
"We cannot, therefore, support it."
"We will instead vote in favour of Amendment No 1, a common sense amendment proposed by our British friends."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, for his report."
"I believe that it is no exaggeration whatsoever to state that, today, history is blending with the present, and that in this historic present which we are living in, the European Union and United Nations are two principal actors."
"Commissioner Patten told us clearly that the European Union is seeking to confirm its presence on the international stage and become a factor for stability, moderation and normalisation within a world order under shared leadership."
"The United Nations must, moreover, operate better and become more efficient in order to adapt to the new circumstances."
"From the founding spirit of the San Francisco Charter to the twenty-first century, from 60 nations to 190, from colonial regimes to independence and from the fall of the system of blocs to today’s globalised world."
"Today, following the lessons of 11 September, it is clear that notions of security, defence policy, trade, conflict prevention, crisis management, humanitarian aid, culture and even civilisation are notions which are mixed up with each other and that it must accepted in the common conscience that, in view of the dangers and threats which affect us all equally, our response must also be equal amongst all of us."
"This response, the European Union's response, must not, however, be a fragmented, contradictory or ineffective response: it must be a unified response."
"Therefore, Mr President, moving beyond the Parliamentary dimension of relations between the European Union and the United Nations – which is necessary and correct – it is important that we act in an agreed manner, in a complementary manner, and that the European Union demonstrate clearly that its strength lies in its unity and its weakness in its fragmentation."
"We are therefore moving towards spheres of shared sovereignty between the Member States, otherwise we will be forced to concede them to other powers which are fully aware of the advantages of unity and size."
"Moreover, either we stop voting in the United Nations differently 60 times out of every 100, or we will have to abandon once and for all the European Union's aspirations to be on the path to shared world leadership."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that I agree with the indignation expressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro at the enforced absence from this Parliament of Sakharov Prize winner, Oswaldo Payá."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to be honest, it is quite bizarre that at the very time when we are seeing ever more globalisation with global politics and economics becoming more interdependent – think of the number of multinationals around – and unfortunately, also as criminal organisations begin to operate and cooperate internationally, the United Nations is proving weak in certain areas and at this very time is often pushed to one side."
"I believe that many in this House share my group’s feeling – and my own – that the United Nations is the one global political institution that needs to be strengthened, that represents the rule of international law, and should not be pushed aside, as it was over Iraq. All this is reflected both in the spirit and the letter of Mr Laschet’s report."
"Nevertheless, an honest and objective observer has to acknowledge that the United Nations has proved weak on a number of occasions. There has been a whole series of wrongdoing, genocide and crimes against humanity where the United Nations has been ineffective."
"Some people see this as a justification for pushing the United Nations to one side – and often these are the very people who have used their veto to prevent the United Nations from taking rapid action, as in the case of the situation in the Middle East."
"I believe, however, that the United Nations needs to be strengthened, to become more efficient, and to be given the opportunity to intervene promptly."
"Let me make it clear that I believe this includes the possibility of taking preventative action where necessary, because if anyone is able and suited to act as the world’s policeman, then it is undoubtedly the United Nations."
"I am very pleased that Mr Laschet has taken up one of my ideas, which was drafted in conjunction with my group, namely that we need to create a regulatory framework that allows the United Nations to intervene promptly in cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"It should not be left to the discretion of individual countries, states or governments to identify such cases and then intervene. It should be international institutions that identify impending danger."
"In that way, the United Nations ought to be able to intervene promptly and, if necessary, to take preventative action."
"The United Nations would not need its own army for this."
"Reference has been made to NATO, and, although I do not want to overestimate its capacities, NATO could become involved if the United Nations gave the green light, taking action to uphold law and order and seeking to prevent crimes against humanity."
"Reforming the Security Council along these lines is certainly essential."
"The changes would need to include a seat for the European Union, but at the same time we must ensure that we do not end up multiplying vetoes and blocking tactics."
"Let me say once more: we have had enough of this world where individuals, individual governments and individual states think they can police the world."
"If there is one role the United Nations was made for, it is the role of upholding law and order throughout the world, and doing so with the full support of the European Union."
"Mr President, the EU must have a common foreign policy and common Foreign Minister and be a legal person."
"The issue is whether this is at all necessary."
"Looking at the statistics, it emerges that the Member States are in agreement."
"In the UN, there is consensus on well over 90% of matters, so I wonder if the issue right now is not so much a shortage of new institutions but, rather, our feeling unable to use the power we do in actual fact have."
"Perhaps it is also necessary to consider how we use the UN."
"For one thing, we expect things from the UN and anticipate its being able to carry out tasks successfully."
"Are we too, however, in a position to comply with our obligations, namely to support the UN system when required: as when, for example, the weapons inspectorate told us that there was probably no imminent threat from Iraq in the form of weapons of mass destruction; or when Hans Blix told us that there was probably no threat and that, if these weapons of mass destruction were in fact there, he was certain that he and his colleagues would be in a position to find them."
"If, on that occasion, we had paid attention to the UN system, we should perhaps have avoided a situation in which the international terrorism expert, Gareth Evans, in Davos was obliged to say that the terrorist threat is greater now than it was before the war against Iraq."
"Perhaps the weaknesses and problems of the UN also have to do, then, with our inability to rely upon the system’s in actual fact being able to undertake anything sensible."
"I should like to recommend that we be very sincere in our support of the UN and that we also be more active in the battle to reform it."
"We need to reform the Security Council."
"We need to have a system that operates as an alternative to anarchy so that we can safeguard international law through, for example, the UN."
"Mr President, today we are awarding the Sakharov prize to Mr Kofi Annan as a sign of our total support of the UN."
"This rare occasion also gives me the opportunity to draw attention to neglected issues or lost causes."
"One of these lost causes is respect for international law, in defence of which Mr Annan has, despite the American bulldozer, brought all his personal qualities and the full dignity of his position to bear."
"The war took place, admittedly, but, from the outset, it was tainted with illegitimacy and discredited by its motives."
"The subsequent, after-the-event revelations as to the bogus and false nature of the charges against Iraq must give solace to those who more readily denounce the environmental dangers to our planet than arms stocks conspicuous by their apparent absence."
"Another voice that has been continually hushed and drowned out is that of indigenous peoples who, although being the last survivors of ancient civilisations attach fundamental importance to environmental values and have a better understanding than ourselves of interdependency."
"In this world of ours that has become materialistic and superficial, people who have nothing left to defend but their fundamental rights are virtuous and authentic out of all proportion.Let us refute this marginalisation of indigenous peoples’ rights and let us make the Union and the UN promise to maintain the working group on indigenous peoples in the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights."
"Mr President, we are glad that this report comes precisely at a time when Kofi Annan is due to speak to us in a few hours."
"I believe that, in the report we have before us, it is important to stress the significance, and the role, that we want to see accorded to the United Nations."
"So that the exit from Iraq does not turn into a nightmare of the kind we have sometimes seen in the past, everyone is now calling upon the UN to intervene in Iraq by launching an initiative and by playing an active role there of the kind that, for months, has been blocked by two countries which, to some extent, had a lot to fear from a UN role and which thought that this was in danger of being less effective that it should be."
"We are particularly pleased that the report mentions an important initiative that could be headed by the EU."
"I am referring to the idea of democratic countries in the UN being able to assemble and meet within the organisation to draw up joint measures to promote democracy."
"That is an initiative in connection with which the European Union could play an important role within the United Nations, whose difficulties and inertia we took note of when, last year, someone from a country like Libya, which is certainly not at the forefront of human rights, was elected as head of the Human Rights Commission."
"This initiative is, in any case, what the Italian radical Members are advocating."
"They are urging Commissioner Patten and the Member States to make it possible for there to be a specific and symbolic initial meeting of the Community of Democracies before the next Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva."
"Mr President, first of all let me congratulate my good friend Mr Laschet on his brave attempt to reform the structures of the UN, which were shown to be sadly lacking during the recent Gulf War."
"The report also looks at the role that the EU should play within the UN."
"Clearly, the UN was designed for the Cold War period in which permanent membership status and veto rights were necessary for the nuclear powers to ensure global security."
"Not enough has changed yet in the world to justify changing that."
"The responsibility of security often conflicts with the additional mandate of the UN to protect human rights, as many of the UN Member States are undemocratic dictatorships – resulting in the perverse decision to appoint Libya as Chair of its Human Rights Committee."
"Furthermore, in the past, the UN was powerless to stop the brutal invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan as a result of the Soviet veto."
"China is still not a democracy or a respecter of human rights, making security the main responsibility of the UN and it has a vital role to play in the world."
"I believe there is a case to be made for India and Japan to be given permanent membership status as a result of their size and democratic status."
"Similarly, Nigeria or Brazil could be candidates."
"Unfortunately, this report conflicts with a number of stated positions of my party, the British Conservatives, as it attempts to dilute UK veto powers with a double veto and suggests an EU seat on the Security Council, which would undermine British and French membership."
"We are also opposed to an EU foreign minister and to a legal personality for the EU, and therefore, no matter how well intentioned the report is, I cannot support it as it stands."
"With my party, however, I will of course be monitoring closely any attempt to reform the UN."
"We welcome very warmly today the presence in the Chamber of Secretary-General Kofi Annan."
"Mr President, this debate on the excellent report by Mr Laschet and the conferral of the Sakharov prize on the United Nations Secretary-General shows the European Parliament’s ever clearer desire to reaffirm the unique and irreplaceable role of the UN in international relations, in line with the Millennium Declaration and the Commission Communication."
"Furthermore, the resolution that we are going to vote on in a short while also shows in a clear and detailed manner the direction that relations between the Union and the UN should take."
"A very large number of proposals, which I support, have been tabled, both as regards reinforcing the role of the European Union within a stronger United Nations through, for example, a seat on the Security Council, and as regards reinforcing cooperation between the Union institutions and the United Nations system."
"These are ambitious proposals for reform, since the European Union would eventually see itself as having the roles of secular arm of the UN or of the UN’s elder daughter, in the same way that a country that I know well was once spoken of as the Church’s elder daughter."
"It is even envisaged, in Article 17, that the European Union must play a pioneering role in defining UN policy."
"Excellent!"
"In the background to these encouraging and dynamic projects, however, some issues remain, which are worrying while they remain unresolved, in particular the issue of the position and role of the UN’s most important member, the United States."
"What can the UN/European Union alliance do faced with the US’s unilateralism, its opposition to the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Protocol and its desire to use, on its own and quite freely, its military force, as soon as it considers its security threatened?"
"The UN and the European Union must, together, continue to make a huge effort to ensure that the UN really can exercise this credible multilateral international authority that the whole world really needs."
"– Mr President, this report definitely belongs in the list of top-quality Parliamentary topics."
"If only there were not such a great gulf between theory and practice, between the words and reality, we could vote to approve it."
"The report refers to a European Constitution that does not yet exist, and unfortunately the draft Constitution text is more focused on increased defence activities and greater ability to intervene in situations around the world than on disarmament and civil conflict resolution."
"The report takes up the cause of multilateralism and strengthening the role of the UN, which is right and good."
"It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action."
"As the war on Iraq has shown, no lie is too risky for use in justifying a preventative war."
"Those who support the war are called yes-men; those who do not are called obstructive."
"This is how people seek to divide what will soon be a Union of 25 Member States."
"The United States’ high-handed decision to override the UN has proven a miscalculation for which the national economy is having to pay, as we are now seeing."
"With its calls for reform, the EU is the only constant in an ever-changing world."
"The EU would be well-advised to develop its relationship with the UN rather than to strengthen its ties with NATO."
"The report highlights the importance of development and cooperation, but should be even more specific."
"Instead of spending huge sums on the arms race and military operations, money should be spent on education, healthcare, economic development and the fight to eradicate poverty."
"If we are to weed out violence and terrorism, we need as much money as possible and more effort."
"Mr President, in 1945 the Charter of the United Nations stood for equal rights for all nations, large and small, as the best guarantee to maintain international peace and security."
"Its first Article proclaimed the principle of self-determination of peoples."
"20 years later, in 1966, the first Article of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political rights reaffirmed that all peoples have the right to self-determination."
"Unfortunately, the draft Constitutional Treaty of the European Union contains no recognition whatsoever of the right to self-determination for the peoples of the stateless nations of Europe."
"I should like to remind you that under Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, in the event of a conflict between the obligations of countries as members of the United Nations and their obligations under any other international agreement, the Charter shall prevail."
"Let me finish by quoting you an enlightening statement given by Mr Annan as he presented his Millennium report in April 2000: 'the best way to prevent conflict is to promote political arrangements in which all groups are fairly represented'."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mr Laschet, the rapporteur, for his excellent report, which should receive the support of the vast majority of people in plenary today."
"Many speakers have emphasised how important it is that the global community should take joint action, failing which many problems will remain insuperable."
"I would like to remind you of the importance of environmental pollution and the fight to eradicate poverty in particular."
"These are subjects that can only be tackled together, and Amendment No 7, which has been submitted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, stresses the importance of the water supply."
"I would, however, like to mention one subject that has not, so far, been discussed in very great detail, and one to which I urge Commissioner Patten to give his particular attention."
"This subject is a common approach to human rights in the field of modern medicine and biotechnology."
"A few months ago, Parliament approved a very good report produced by Robert Evans of the Socialist Group, on combating illegal trade in human organs."
"Yet when we look at developing countries and newly industrialising countries, there is a great deal to be done in this area, and I think this is another task on which the EU and the UN must cooperate."
"What is more, Parliament has often underlined its opposition to human cloning and its desire that the UN should intervene in this area too."
"We are following the debate in the UN Committees with great interest – and let me emphasise once again, Commissioner Patten, that the European Parliament supports the Costa Rican initiative, which also has the backing of over 60 other members of the UN."
"This is expressly stated once again in Amendment No 8."
"While Kofi Annan is with us, I think we should reiterate the importance of this new task for the UN, for new developments demand new responses."
"Mr President, the latest Eurobarometer survey confirms that European citizens massively support an integrated foreign and defence policy."
"Seventy-three per cent of those questioned in the 15 Member States of the Union come down in favour of a European Union foreign policy independent of that of the United States."
"Sixty-four per cent of those questioned believe that the European Union should have its own seat in the UN Security Council."
"In light of this encouraging result, one of the main issues for the European political parties in the next electoral campaign must be to argue in favour of multilateralism, reform of the United Nations and a visible European presence in the Security Council."
"Mr Laschet’s report is quite right to remind us that respect for the system of the United Nations is the best way to bring about security and peace in the world."
"The United Nations’ authority was seriously flouted, in spring 2003, by the unilateral decision by the US and Britain to launch a pre-emptive war on the basis, as we now know, of false pretexts."
"The European Union was divided and the US Government was happy to see them battling it out amongst themselves."
"There is currently no provision in the Treaty to force the Member States of the European Union to adopt a common position before entering into debate and seeking the decisive votes in the Security Council."
"This is a flaw in and, I would even say, a disgraceful aspect of, the current institutional system, a system that the Convention’s draft constitution hardly remedies."
"On the other hand, the proposal for a draft resolution to give the EU a permanent seat on the Security Council would naturally put things back on an even keel."
"This seat would not overshadow those seats held by the two European permanent members and their sacrosanct right of veto, but it would force the governments of Member States to try to see the main points and to compromise."
"This would be a small step towards a coherent foreign and security policy."
"I stress that it would be but a small step whilst the absurd system of unanimity persists that allows a single country to block the expression of European political will."
"We need to give strength and value to the UN and give strength and value to the European Union, strength that should derive from the ability to be a point of reference in terms of political, moral, ethical, economic and social practice."
"The UN and the European Union emerged from the ashes of the devastation of the Second World War."
"At the time, it was said ‘never again’, and so rejecting war and eradicating poverty should be the cornerstones of the European Union and the UN."
"Commissioner Patten is right that what we need is not just peace, but peace combined with justice."
"I am sorry to say, however, that peace and justice are not such key issues."
"The European Constitution talks about promoting peace but it does not accept that rejecting war and negotiating solutions to conflicts are fundamental."
"In recent years, the UN has been devalued, partly at least by the military policy of a fundamentalist president of a country that still practices the death penalty in many of its states and that rejects international organisations, not least the International Criminal Court."
"War has become legitimate again; militarism is permeating hearts and minds."
"I do not underestimate the important commitment made by Mr Laschet and all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Together with the message sent out by awarding the Sakharov prize to Kofi Annan, it is a clear message designed to restore value to the European Union and the United Nations and to once again give them a role."
"It is, however, essential that security for everyone, the reduction of poverty and the promotion of justice and peace are genuine practices and not just empty promises."
"The UN and the European Union, together with other countries, must re-establish trust and, above all, respect for international law."
"Mr President, I must thank my colleague Mr Laschet for this report, which is far-reaching and envisages great opportunities, but we must also devise a way to move from the current situation towards realising these opportunities."
"First of all, I must say that I had a great experience of collaboration with the United Nations when I was working with its Vice-Secretary General on a report that I was completing, within the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, on protecting children’s rights."
"I feel that the proposal made by Mr Laschet represents the first phase of a reform that the UN must, however, face up to."
"Having left behind the rationale of Yalta and power blocs, we must make the case for increasing multilateralism."
"We must make new nations responsible at world level, without removing time-honoured instruments through which world peace has been promoted; and the right of veto is one such time-honoured instrument."
"The Security Council must, in any case, be enlarged, and we then need to consider new permanent members, without the right of veto."
"These could include the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Japan, India, Italy and South Africa."
"Furthermore, we also need to expand the number of members elected to the Security Council and then reform the Agencies to make them more operational on the ground."
"We need to speed up the promotion of human rights and the affirmation of the principles of democracy."
"We need to assume that the United Nations intends to protect people, since it invokes the concept of the nation and not that of the state, and the concept of the nation presupposes the protection of the person."
"This process of protecting people needs to start as a matter of urgency because terrorism is hot on our heels: today it is in the guise of Al-Qaedaand Bin Laden, tomorrow it could have a different name."
"Of course, a reformed NATO could be the international police force that the UN might need."
"Division and exclusion certainly give rise to war; union and the philosophical concept of union instead promote important goals of peace."
"Mr President, let me begin with three personal recollections."
"I was privileged to address the UN working group in Geneva on indigenous peoples and thus witnessed how it forms a world parliament for some of the most oppressed minorities anywhere in our world."
"I was privileged also to represent Parliament in East Timor, where I witnessed at first hand Sergio Vieira de Mello’s successful efforts in rebuilding a whole country – a talent so tragically lost to us."
"This is why I attend meetings of United Nations associations in my East of England constituency, where the role and ideals of the UN are cherished at a very local level."
"The United Nations inspires me and all of us here in Europe."
"It is why Europe rightly champions UN policies: the 0.7% target in the Millennium Goals within EU development policy, and Europe providing over half of all support to the UN High Commission for Refugees, which stands up for fundamental rights as a bulwark against the racism and xenophobia now sweeping our continent."
"This is why we back UN reform that will secure greater efficiency and also inject new vision."
"Other policies championed by the EU are the UN convention on disability, the move beyond the Global Compact towards a binding treaty on corporate accountability and the idea of an economic security council to oversee the Bretton Woods institutions."
"Finally, I am concerned that some of the proposals for changes in the veto system, the composition of the Security Council, or suggestions for an EU mandate prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and may not carry support in all of our countries."
"Despite these concerns, where we have differences in Europe, most notably recently over Iraq, these concern how best to uphold the authority of the UN."
"That authority is once again reaffirmed in Mr Laschet’s report and in our vote here this morning."
"Mr President, following the Second World War, there were high hopes that a worldwide organisation would give the world lasting peace and provide people with freedom and democracy."
"These hopes were, however, dashed by the fact that the great powers often used their vetoes to block the UN’s work."
"All too many member countries completely ignored the principles of the state governed by law."
"Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of most of the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe, the UN’s prospects of achieving its aims have clearly improved."
"In spite of this, the UN has not been especially successful in getting its member countries to comply with the human freedoms and rights laid down in its Charter."
"In this area, the UN has been too passive."
"I believe that the UN’s inability to get its member countries to observe the principles concerning freedoms and rights and the state governed by law has undermined civic commitment to UN matters."
"There were many of us who were very surprised to note that even a representative of a dictatorship can be the Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"In such circumstances, it is only natural that civic commitment is instead channelled through, for example, organisations such as Amnesty International."
"The UN now needs greater civic commitment, which would strengthen it as a worldwide organisation."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted my proposal that it must be possible for countries that seriously and systematically violate human freedoms and rights to lose their voting rights in the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"This proposal must be seen as a step in this direction, that is to say an attempt to increase people’s confidence in the UN in this area."
"Mr President, today is an excellent time to be debating the very good report by Mr Laschet on the relations between the European Union and the UN as, at the same time, we are receiving Kofi Annan, not just as a person, but as an institution, as a symbol of an irreplaceable need for the UN."
"The report we are debating is in essence a single proposal on relations between the European Union and the UN, but it is a strategic proposal for the UN itself at the dawn of the twenty-first century."
"The UN, despite generally expressing the need for a peaceful world at its inception, reflecting the balances at the end of the Second World War, is in need of some adjustment."
"Today circumstances are different and must be expressed."
"However, until they are expressed effectively, the UN is irreplaceable."
"Many consider that the UN is the refuge of small countries which have no other way of expressing their opinions."
"However, the Iraqi crisis and its impasses show that the superpowers have equal need of it."
"Attempts at new international balances such as the enlarged G8 or the messianic crusading perception of the various superpowers of their role lead nowhere."
"Proposing a strategy for the UN and the European Union, however, we note that we ourselves have serious gaps which we need to plug."
"We recently experienced the lack of agreement in the UN Security Council."
"The enlarged European Union, with the 25 members, will have the possibility to be expressed by many more members of the Security Council, in that it will have the possibility to be expressed by three different geographical areas of the UN."
"This possibility, in conjunction with the presence, which I hope will come about, of a minister of foreign affairs at the UN, will provide many more possibilities."
"If the new distribution does in fact result in the European Union's gaining a place on the Security Council, without other countries losing their place, this will allow it, from that position, to support policies for peace, cooperation, security, democracy and all the claims of mankind, which are objectives which we must attain."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Laschet’s report, comprehensive and ambitious though it is."
"It comes at a sensitive time for both the European Union and the United Nations."
"I want to refer in particular to the UN Development Programme."
"The report made in 2002 on the subject of Arab human development was described by magazine as the most important publication of the year, and more than a million people downloaded it from the UNDP website."
"It had particular relevance for the EU since it was the impetus for the recent Commission communication – for which I am currently rapporteur – on reinvigorating human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners."
"Last year’s UNDP Arab human development report stated that – subject to fieldwork surveys – the appetite for democracy in the Arab world was, at 60%, the highest of any region in the world."
"Compare that, for example, with Eastern Europe, where the figure was 30%."
"The Arab world also logged the highest rejection of authoritarian rule – the figure in this regard was 80% – and was indeed the third highest in favour of gender equality in higher education."
"So the perception that many have that the Arab world is not ready for democracy is undermined by the United Nations’ own reports."
"I hope, therefore, that the Council and Commission can, as it were, put our money where our mouth is, and redirect some of the enormous funds available for good governance, the development of civil society, democracy and the rule of law, which, in the external field – the responsibility of Commissioners Patten and Nielson – amounts to EUR 1.9 billion a year."
"By contrast, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights – a rather smaller fund aimed at the ex-Soviet Bloc – which I had the honour to set up a few years ago, amounts to only EUR 106 million."
"That is an indication of the distortion in spending which we need to address, and in particular the priorities with which I hope the European Parliament will play some part in helping the Commission in the coming years."
"Mr President, I wish sincerely to thank Mr Laschet for a well-written and important report that is politically well balanced and forward-looking."
"I shall concentrate on four points."
"The first concerns Amendment No 6 by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself."
"It has also been supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The European Parliament ‘[c]onsiders that the elaboration of the common foreign and security policy towards the UN should be characterised by the participation and joint influence of all the European Union’s Member States’."
"If we have a common foreign and security policy, it cannot be devised solely by the major powers: Germany, France and perhaps also Great Britain."
"All the Member States must feel they are participating in this area."
"The smaller Member States must not be confronted by a , with a common foreign and security policy having come about because the larger countries have already adopted positions."
"Otherwise, there is no common foreign and security policy."
"Regarding paragraph 19, I would, secondly, emphasise the value of depriving countries that systematically infringe human rights of their right to vote in the UN Commission on Human Rights until such breaches cease."
"This must be pursued in a UN context."
"The third point I wish to emphasise concerns the UN Security Council."
"The EU should make better use of the two votes that EU Member States, namely Great Britain and France, now already, in actual fact, possess in the Security Council."
"We must not therefore weaken the EU’s current 40% representation in the UN Security Council."
"I should now like to address Mr Patten regarding Amendment No 8, also supported by the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group."
"We support Costa Rica’s initiative and the UN General Assembly’s decision to work on a corresponding convention in 2004 on banning human cloning."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is splendid, and it is even more splendid that we will, in a few minutes, be able to welcome the current Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan."
"I would of course like to take this moment to recall that there have already been three UN Secretaries-General who hailed from Europe: Trygve Lie, Dag Hammarskjöldand Kurt Waldheim, and that Europe is home to two permanent UN offices, in Geneva and Vienna."
"This means that we share responsibility to a large extent."
"Not only do we have claims upon each other, but we also have to take joint action and support each other."
"The most recent UN Secretary-General to come from Europe, Kurt Waldheim, wrote this in his book ‘Die Antwort’: ‘I have to concede that the UN, notwithstanding all our efforts and our unquestionable sincerity, has not yet managed to break with the political habits and attitudes of past centuries and to come to terms with the new realities with which we have to live."
"The charge is laid against us that it produces more rhetoric than action, that it is ineffective and is often ignored, and that the system under which every state has a vote allows the developing world to dominate the decision-making process, in that the number of votes bears no relation to the capacity to act.’"
"The same could also be said of the European Union; both of us are in need of reform."
"The two of us have a great deal in common."
"Success is dependent on political will and the determination of the Member States."
"It depends on acceptance and implementation – of Community law in one case, and of the United Nations Charter in the other."
"It is dependent upon multilateral cooperation, global responsibility and upon our thinking along Community-oriented lines rather than nationalistically."
"We can make our contribution if France and England leave the Security Council and the EU joins it; we would thereby be reforming the EU and our own Common Foreign and Security Policy, and forcing through a reform of the UN Security Council."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the report is a positive response from Parliament to the Commission’s outline of relations between the EU and the United Nations."
"We support this, although we would like to underline a number of specific aspects."
"First of all, and certainly not in contravention of the report, we should like to emphasise the institutional reforms that are necessary."
"We must be able to reform the Security Council."
"It must be possible for Africa, Asia and Latin America to be permanent members."
"After all, it is not acceptable that only the rich and the rich countries in the world should have the final word, while two thirds of the world population live in poverty."
"Secondly, the veto system must be reviewed and may only be used when peace is under threat – under real threat – and in the event of aggression."
"Thirdly, the European Union must acquire full membership in the Security Council and in the General Assembly."
"It is because we would like to see effective multilateralism that we believe it necessary that the United Nations be effectively organised and enabled to take decisions effectively."
"This has not always been the case in the past, and the global repercussions are tragic."
"I would remind you of the ineffective mandates that are sometimes given to soldiers who have to act on behalf of the United Nations in peace operations."
"Their mandate is so inflexible that it renders them non-operational."
"I would remind you of the tragedy in Rwanda, of which Kofi Annan recently reminded us."
"Fortunately, things went more smoothly in Congo, but we hope that the United Nations will, in future, work more transparently and, above all, more democratically."
". Mr President, this morning’s debate has made clear the Parliament’s strong interest in enhancing the European Union’s engagement with the United Nations."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, are to be commended on the production of this report."
"I fully subscribe to the statement in the report that 'the success of global governance, in the face of the challenges posed by growing globalisation and interdependence, can only be based on an effective and fair multilateral system unequivocally anchored in the United Nations'."
"The Council is firmly and formally committed to effective multilateralism in its external action."
"A rules-based international order with the United Nations at its heart is a central element of the European Security Strategy, which the European Council adopted in December 2003."
"I can assure you that Council, under the Irish presidency, is determined to work towards a more effective collective response to today’s threats."
"We are all keenly aware that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are threats that present serious challenges, but global stability is also threatened by endemic poverty and lack of development, as well as the scourge of HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases."
"These are hugely destabilising factors that will literally destroy the prospects of many countries if they are not effectively remedied."
"Yesterday I told Secretary-General Annan that, in implementing the European Security Strategy, the European Union will work particularly closely with the UN to enhance mutual cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management."
"We agreed that we would work closely on devising better planning and best-practice models for conflict prevention and post-conflict peace building."
"We will base this on both our organisations' experiences in these policy areas."
"This will involve working together on the practical implementation of the Joint Declaration on EU-UN Cooperation in Crisis Management signed late in 2003."
"We also discussed how best to build on the successful deployment in 2003 of Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"Before this presidency ends we are aiming to have up to 1500 military personnel available to be deployed as an EU rapid reaction capability at the disposal of the Secretary-General for crisis management operations."
"Mr Annan is very supportive of this valuable resource becoming available as soon as possible."
"I assured the Secretary-General that the European Union was fully behind his efforts to find – to use his words – a credible and convincing collective answer to the challenges of our time."
"The Union will therefore support the work of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change."
"I believe that the European Union can make an important contribution to this highly relevant debate."
"The presidency appreciates the enthusiastic support of the Commission in this endeavour and the work presently under way."
"The Secretary-General has made clear his view that any changes must be a means to an end, not an end in themselves."
"The United Nations must show, in practical and concrete ways, that it is capable of fulfilling the first purpose laid down in the Charter, which is to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace."
"Developing our rapid reaction capability in the coming months will be a demonstration of this Union's willingness to contribute and to assist the UN in this important area of activity."
"Today’s debate is timely."
"Given the challenges to the multilateral system that Secretary-General Annan has placed in the spotlight in such a determined way – including last Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos – the central thrust of this report, which reaffirms support for a strong, reformed UN at the centre of the multilateral system, is very welcome."
"This confirms that the Secretary-General, the Council, and the Commission have the support of the people’s representatives in Parliament in this endeavour."
"The report clearly articulates the need for the European Union to 'punch its weight' at the United Nations."
"European Union Member States are, collectively, major financial contributors to the United Nations, contributing almost 40% of its budget."
"The European Union will, as the report notes, represent some 450 million people from 1 May 2004."
"The Council agrees fully that the EU needs to develop a commensurate political profile."
"The general thrust of the report strengthens the Council in its engagement with the United Nations."
"I wish to assure you that one of the aims of the Irish presidency is to make the EU more focused, more flexible and more responsive at the United Nations."
"I am determined that we will devote more effort to engaging with our international partners on these important questions, in the interests of both the UN and the EU."
"Effective multilateralism will be a subject of discussion at all our summits with strategic partners during this presidency."
"Today’s discussion has highlighted a number of varied and interesting points which reflect the scope, detail and ambition of the report."
"We have read and heard many proposals, some of which can be endorsed immediately."
"Some others, it would be fair to say, will need to be discussed over time."
"The proposal that the presidency inform the Parliament of the content of the EU Priorities for each UN General Assembly session seems an excellent idea, and the Council will act on this."
"The proposal for exchanges of views between high-level UN officials and the committees of the Parliament is also to be commended."
"The question of EU representation at the United Nations will certainly need to be addressed in the light of the final outcome of the negotiations on the Constitution, which will confer a legal personality on the European Union."
"Some of the issues raised are much more complex, and merit careful consideration."
"I wish to commend the ambition of the report for the range of proposals that it contains concerning the activity of the Parliament in relation to the various funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations."
"No doubt this is work that the committee concerned and the Parliament will advance over time."
"I have also noted carefully what was said regarding the representation of the EU in the Security Council."
"Clearly, this is not an issue that can be easily resolved at the moment."
"It must be kept under review as our common policies develop over time."
"Likewise, the issue of the reform of the Security Council is not one that can be easily resolved."
"The High-Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General will address this question, among others."
"We are all aware of the difficulties and problems encountered by advocates of institutional reform in the UN."
"The necessary consensus remains difficult to develop."
"This, however, must not deflect us from the essential task of making the Security Council, and the multilateral system as a whole, more effective in meeting the challenges of today’s world."
"Again, let me reiterate my appreciation of this initiative."
"It has provided a stimulus for the ongoing discussion of the EU’s support for the UN and the Parliament’s role in that regard."
"I can assure you that the Council is firmly aware of the issues that are addressed in it, and of the issues that have been raised here today."
"– Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 10.30 a.m.(1)"
"– The Laschet report on the relations between the European Union and the UN has been tabled with great ceremony and to underline its importance it has been linked with the award of the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan."
"It actually seeks to establish a ‘Stateless diplomacy’ supported by a network of organisations over which national democracies have little control. The declared intentions (in essence, a commitment to multilateralism, respect for human rights, peacekeeping and nature conservation) appear to be excellent."
"But how is democratic control to be exerted?"
"In fact, the Laschet report seeks primarily to limit the Member States’ scope for action at the UN and to replace them with the European Union, controlled by the European Parliament, which is taking advantage of this to raise its status."
"This is tantamount to saying, however, that we prefer ‘democracies that are low on substance’, like the European democracy, to really meaningful national democracies."
"In particular, the Laschet report welcomes the reforms that the European Constitution would bring if it were adopted, including specifically legal personality for the Union and a European minister for foreign affairs, which would enable this programme to become a reality."
"That is one further reason to reject both the Constitution and the Laschet report."
"– Yes to a more active role for the EU within the UN, as recommended by the report."
"‘Multilateralism (which) remains the best way to achieve global peace and security’, is indeed one way of guaranteeing that we avoid the supremacy of one superpower."
"But the objectives that are set out disregard reality and current dangers."
"Declarations of intent are no longer enough: poverty eradication, human development, conflict prevention and peacekeeping all require a degree of financial and political investment that is equal to these challenges."
"Following the armed intervention and occupation of Iraq by the United States and the suppression – to the point of extinction? – of the Palestinian people, the spirit that prevailed when the United Nations was created and the principles underlying the Charter are more than ever being ridden over roughshod and even trampled underfoot by certain countries."
"Now more than ever we need to defend international law and champion the right of nations to self-determination with renewed vigour and that means taking action."
"The United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara, for example, including holding a referendum on self-determination, must be implemented, regardless of any further shilly-shallying by the Moroccan Government."
"Proper sanctions must also be applied in cases where human rights are violated or the environment is damaged."
"The UN peace missions in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Liberia, together with the reconstruction of Afghanistan, as well as the humanitarian work for children and the fight against hunger and diseases all indicate that the UN continues to play an essential role in establishing peace and security."
"I therefore join Kofi Annan in his call for a radical reform of the UN."
"At present, this organisation is far too bureaucratic and not in tune with the geopolitical realities of the 21st century."
"The EU which, together with its Member States, accounts for nearly 50% of the UN budget, should take the lead in this reform."
"It is essential in this respect that the EU should be able to speak with one voice in the Security Council."
"All credit to the EU for continuing to encourage the UN to face up to its responsibilities with regard to conflict prevention and maintaining the peace."
"It should not, however, be mere lip service."
"For hazardous operations in Africa, we are forced to call upon badly equipped and unmotivated troops from Bangladesh, Pakistan or India."
"Sometimes, this creates more problems than it solves."
"Why can the EU as such not deploy more troops under the UN flag with a UN mandate?"
"I therefore call for a European Union which decisively takes the lead in the reform of the United Nations, not only with fine declarations and symbolic contributions, but, above all, with concrete commitments and actual solidarity at the coalface."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"– Mr President, I have been told by those of my colleagues who understand Italian that, on paragraph 35 of the UN report, you said ‘, which apparently means ‘rejected’."
"That paragraph was, however, adopted by an overwhelming majority of the House, including the Socialists, and we ask you to amend your lists accordingly."
"Mr President, it was made clear during yesterday’s debate that there are certain parts of this report, which expressly refer to OLAF, which are being removed from it on the recommendation of the Legal Services since they are not admissible, and these parts are therefore not being voted on."
"(1)"
"– Mr President, given the late hour, the fact that we are behind schedule and the difficulty that Members are going to have negotiating the traffic to reach the airport, there is a danger that there will not be enough of us left to vote on the last reports on the agenda."
"In agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, our group proposes that the vote on this report be postponed and that it be put to the vote as the first item of voting time on the Wednesday of the next Strasbourg part-session."
"Mr President, I would request on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists that, given the time, the vote be postponed until the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I know that many Members have very important commitments back in their constituencies and regions, and maybe even more important appointments back at the airport."
"However, we have been waiting for a number of reports, especially the Zappalà report, to come to the floor of this House for a reasonable period of time now."
"We all have our voting lists in front of us, we were sent here to vote on these issues, so can we now get on with it?"
"It seems that we are putting things off for no reason whatsoever."
"– Mr President, as my group’s shadow rapporteur, I would nevertheless like further reassurance that this is only about deferring the vote, and that the agreements reached between the groups will be unaffected and will not again be rescinded."
"– Mr President, this part contradicts a resolution already adopted by this House on the liberal professions."
"I therefore ask that it be amended along the lines we have already agreed to, so that the oral amendment would read: ‘Considers that the Commission should not only take account of the market situation in applying the provisions of competition law to the liberal professions, but must also bear in mind the social aspects and tasks in the public interest."
"Calls therefore on the Commission to allow associations of the liberal professions the discretion to take measures to permit them to perform their functions correctly.’"
"– Mr President, when I was a law student, my tutors, among them my father, taught me the fundamental distinction that German philosophy draws between – the world as it should be – and – the world as it really is."
"This morning, in adopting this resolution on relations between the European Union and the United Nations, it is quite possible that Parliament has indeed perceived the world as it should be."
"Unfortunately, there is no doubt that the resolution does not take sufficient account of the world as it really is, for better or for worse."
"In particular, it would be a loss to the world and Europe if we were, without any guarantees, to relinquish the United Kingdom’s status as a permanent member and even more so if we were to relinquish that of France."
"That is why I voted against."
"We oppose what are termed binding international treaties governing companies’ activities."
"On this point, we cannot support the present report."
"We instead recommend that companies operate in accordance with responsibly designed voluntary codes of conduct."
".– I voted against the Laschet report on the draft European Constitution, which has not yet been adopted, in order to highlight the Brussels institutions’ long-standing foreign policy ambitions, which involve making the European Union into a fully-fledged international actor ‘as soon as its legal personality is recognised by the Constitution’ (paragraph 10), which amounts to making it an international partner equivalent to a state and with all the characteristics of one, including even permanent membership of the UN."
"I might add that, to all outward appearances, today’s ceremony resembled a mutual support pact between institutions seeking to confer legitimacy upon each other."
"Although the Laschet report does of course steer clear of going into detail about what would become of the seats held by France and the United Kingdom on the Security Council, it is clear that the system proposed by the report would logically result in their abolition."
"Whilst the draft European constitution does not declare that Europe should have one single representative on the international stage, it does put in place all the legal preconditions for it."
"It follows that it is grossly hypocritical to support this Constitution whilst, at the same time, claiming that France will remain a permanent member of the UN."
". The European Parliament has adopted an own-initiative resolution on relations between the EU and the UN, containing key aspects that I believe to be extremely dangerous."
"This applies in particular when it views the EU as a political-military bloc, on the basis of the false assumption that the so-called ‘European Constitution’ has already been approved and ratified. The report even goes as far as to expand on the supranational nature of the constitution in important aspects – in some places, as a matter of fact, appearing to be totally blind to the reality of the situation."
"This proposal represents a clear attack on each country’s sovereignty in its international relations."
"The resolution even takes the view that ‘whenever an EU statement is presented on behalf of the European Union or the European Community, EU Member States should refrain from making their national statements, which should only be envisaged on an exceptional basis and justified in advance to the EU Presidency’."
"Although this resolution deals with serious issues facing humankind, it does not address them seriously and although it focuses on aspects of power, it advocates creating political and military blocs in a framework of an enhanced multilateral system, strengthening the role of the Security Council and attaching less priority to the role of the UN General Assembly."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party fully supports UN reform, including added permanent places in the Security Council for the African, Asian and Latin American groupings."
"But we differ with this resolution in relation to an EU seat and changes to the veto system."
"These we believe to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, and could risk less rather than more references to the UN itself."
"All of us want a strong United Nations."
"– The Laschet report purports to be a plea for multilateralism in international relations."
"It considers that the UN should take centre stage in achieving this objective, with the European Union playing an enhanced role within it."
"But the method advocated to achieve these high-minded wishes is flawed."
"For the report, a more effective UN means an enlarged Security Council, minor restrictions on the right to veto decisions and more means of intervention, including the military option."
"As with Europe, an attempt is being made to embroil us in an institutional debate so that we forget the underlying problem: the fact that it is free competition above all else that determines the European Union’s policy; the fact that the major powers assume the right to decide unilaterally what merits or does not merit economic or military intervention on the part of the UN."
"The fight against terrorism is thus seen as a top priority, whereas the fight against the greenhouse effect, AIDS or poverty is mere formality."
"The UN imposed sanctions on Iraq, but is leaving the Palestinians, Chechens and so many others to their own devices."
"Finally, this report is written as if the European Constitution had been ratified and claims that a European minister for foreign affairs will be able to represent a European consensus on international issues."
"This is irresponsible."
"For all of these reasons, we voted against the report."
"– Whenever Parliament tables a report on the Union’s external policy, the federalist majority in this House cannot resist the temptation of adding points that are completely irrelevant and that, ultimately, detract from the overall work that has been done."
"Although we fully agree with the rapporteur on certain points, in particular on consolidating relations between the UN’s internal bodies, it is inconceivable that ‘the participation of the European Union as a full member in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the UN’ would be accepted or, along the same lines, that ‘the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union whose functions are laid down in the Draft European Constitution should occupy the seat proposed … for the EU’."
"Although it is interesting to note that such proposals reveal the true nature of the federalist project, because they assume, by definition, that the Union will become a State, it is also quite clear that they are the product of pure fantasy."
"One single observation suffices to show how inappropriate this idea is: what would the Union representative have proposed during the Iraq crisis, an issue on which the Union itself was split as never before?"
". The main aim of this report is to strengthen the European Union’s positions in the United Nations."
"It presents a set of proposals for the institutional reform of the UN and reiterates the desire to develop and promote democratic values and respect for human rights."
"I must, however, disagree with some of the points it makes."
"Firstly, we have paragraphs in which the rapporteur appears to forget the fact that no European Constitution has been approved, and that all we have is a Draft Constitutional Treaty!"
"Next, the European Union has no legal personality or Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"We are then presented with the impractical idea of enlarging the United Nations Security Council, giving the EU a seat, without considering the more than likely opposition of the other countries that have places on the Security Council, or the fact that it would be hard to persuade France and the United Kingdom to give up their seats."
"The suggestion to abolish the simple right of veto is also entirely inappropriate."
"In summary, I voted in favour of the report because of the fundamental underlying ideas, but I rejected part of recital G and items 5, 6, 11, 18, 33 and 35."
"As regards the amendments that have been tabled, one that I felt it was crucial to support is No 8, which reiterates the idea of a universal ban on human cloning."
"We have voted in favour of the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1734/94 on financial and technical cooperation with the Occupied Territories (West Bank and Gaza), but we believe that matters must be carefully followed up with a view to making it clear that appropriated EU funds will not be used for purposes other than those intended, for example for propaganda activities not designed to promote peace."
". This report is intended to support the first proposal for a regulation that has been presented on financial and technical support for the Occupied Territories."
"This means that the few amendments that have been tabled are confined to clarifying the content of the provisions."
"The report’s aim is merely to improve and provide legal clarification of the Commission text, from a technical point of view."
"This is a subject area on which I believe there is broad consensus."
"The aim is to provide assistance in cases of occupation, not only to States and regions, but also to local authorities, regional organisations, public agencies, local or traditional communities, organisations supporting business, private operators, cooperatives, mutual societies, associations, foundations and non-governmental organisations."
"I give this proposal my unreserved support."
"Incidentally, at its meeting of 12 January 2004, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy unanimously adopted this draft legislative resolution."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
". The ‘International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture’ is an important legally binding agreement which establishes a global framework for the sustainable conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture."
"I believe this to be an important new element in the multilateral system."
"It is through such Treaties that we can ensure that all countries and all people have fair access to the world’s resources which rightly belong to all humanity."
"I support the amendment adopted by the Environment Committee, which we supported in the Agriculture Committee."
"The basic principle as far as I am concerned, however, is that farmers’ and growers’ rights must be preserved."
"They must remain free to grow crops which have been traditionally grown, without having to pay royalties."
". Although the analysis of the Commission proposal carried out by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy led to only one amendment, the proposal is of enormous importance in the field of plant genetics."
"This subject, which has been under discussion for a long time, was covered by the 2001 International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture."
"The purpose of this proposal for a Council decision is thus to ratify, on behalf of the Community, the aforementioned International Treaty."
"The importance of adopting the report is reflected in the fact that 33 countries out of the 40 signatories have already ratified the International Treaty, which covers 35 food crops and 29 forages and establishes a legally binding framework for the sustainable conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture."
"Another clear indication of the report’s importance is that it won the unanimous vote of the specialised parliamentary committee."
"The intended aim is to allow access to these resources for all contracting parties, sharing the commercial and other benefits accruing from this access."
"I voted in favour."
"Mr President, the main issue at stake in the vote on the Fava and Sanders-ten Holte reports on the single European sky is to adopt rules on the organisation and use of European airspace with the aim of improving the operational capabilities, safety and punctuality of the air navigation services that are provided on a daily basis to thousands of consumers, including most of the Members of this Parliament."
"The interinstitutional agreement that has been reached demonstrates that it was possible not only to improve the legal framework whilst respecting the Treaties, but also to accept the rights of Member States to exercise their sovereignty over airspace above their territories, to safeguard existing international agreements – such as the agreement, for example, that gives Portugal control over air traffic in the North Atlantic – to define, in agreement with the Member States involved, the flight information areas, known as ‘functional blocks’, and to appoint the bodies that provide air navigation services."
"Account was thus taken of the safety interests of air operations, the most important of all being: greater cooperation and technical interoperability, coordination with the military air authorities and the sovereign rights of the Member States in the field of air navigation."
"I could only vote in favour of this convergence of views, which enabled such broad agreement to be reached between the unions and the operators, the national authorities and the Commission and between the Council and the European Parliament."
"– I support the purpose of the Single European Sky, which is to improve traffic flow and air traffic management alongside air safety."
"However, we find the agreement reached in conciliation on the Single Sky unsatisfactory in several respects."
"For example, the compromise that has been reached on civil-military cooperation is problematic."
"Do I need to remind you that this is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity?"
"Military issues do not fall within the remit of the EU but of the Member States, which have their own defence policies and international obligations."
"The Member States should be free to organise their rights over their airspace as they see fit."
"As for creating and modifying functional blocks of airspace, I am delighted that this will be the responsibility of the Member States concerned with Eurocontrol providing technical support."
"It is important that the Member States retain their right to make the final decision."
"Let us bear in mind that the Single European Sky must not be detrimental to civil navigation as a public service or to the safety of European airspace."
"Safety must not be sacrificed to an ever increasing quest for profits."
"– We are not entirely satisfied with the results of the conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the Single European Sky."
"The texts put to the vote are nothing more than compromises between a liberal philosophy and safety requirements, with no mention of the prospect of a Single European Sky organised and controlled by European public services."
"From the outset, we have supported and reported on the action taken by the European unions, who have tirelessly defended the general interest against these moves to transform the sky into a commodity."
"By mobilising their forces and working with conviction, they had the principle of the non-separation of technical services accepted and ensured that the States retained responsibility for the functional blocks of airspace."
"Finally, they obtained a commitment from the Commission to publish a review of the directive in five years’ time."
"Without these concessions from the Council things would have been much worse."
"However, in the light of the liberalisation of the other transport sectors, we remain very concerned about the future of public authority control over this sector, which is subject to fierce competition."
"Moreover, the agreement leaves the Member States free to decide whether to entrust air traffic control to a public service or a private company."
"Because of these concerns, we did not vote in favour of the results of the conciliation procedure."
". Whilst I fully agree with the aims of the proposals we are now looking at, which are to reduce delays in European air transport through the more efficient use of Member States’ airspace and to maintain high levels of safety, I do have concerns that I have always voiced about the content of these proposals."
"In this context I wish to refer to three crucial points in the agreement that has just been concluded: the decision that functional blocks will fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States, which cannot be changed by the European Union, the recognition that more efficient use of airspace depends on closer cooperation between civil and military organisations and the right of each Member State to have total freedom in appointing the service provider, under the auspices of the national supervisory authorities and without having to defer to any other body."
". I voted in favour because I believe that implementing an effective common policy for air transport needs to be strengthened by current safety standards and the overall efficiency of air traffic in Europe in general."
"In fact, without any real guarantees for the regularity and security of air transport services at European level, there will be no genuinely free movement of goods, people and services as enshrined in the Treaties."
"Capacities must be improved so that they meet the needs of all airspace users and flight delays must be minimised. These points further justify my position."
"I welcome the realism that marks the joint text, because it finally provides some real progress from the Commission’s initial proposals, which placed excessive limits on the sovereign power of States over their airspace and led to some confusion between issues relating to the common transport policy and those of a military nature."
"On this matter, prudence dictates that national competences should be respected unreservedly, as should the international agreements that govern them, leaving any closer cooperation to the Member States’ discretion and supervision."
"I therefore believe we would be justified in adopting safeguards that will enable each Member State to implement the necessary measures to protect key interests in the field of security and defence policy."
". The proposal reached in conciliation answers some of the concerns we raised at the beginning of the process, such as that of sovereignty over airspace, since it was laid down that functional blocks will be defined by agreement between Member States."
"In the event of a dispute, States will be able to appeal to the Single Sky Committee, and abide by its opinion, although the report could have gone further in clarifying the rules and principles that must be taken into account."
"At the military level, consideration was given to the need for closer cooperation between civil and military authorities whilst respecting national competences."
"Portugal’s control over the Santa Maria Flight Information Region (conferred by the International Civil Aviation Organisation) was also safeguarded."
"It was also determined that the provision of air traffic services is related to the exercise of public authority prerogatives not of an economic nature, justifying the application of the competition rules as set out in the Treaty and that each Member State can, within its own airspace, appoint the service provider, be it public or private."
"Nevertheless, there are some aspects that we proposed but were not accepted. Hence our abstention from the vote."
". What was really at stake in the vote on the Fava and Sanders-ten Holte reports on the single European sky was the adoption of rules on the framework and organisation of European airspace, aimed at enhancing the operational capability, safety and punctuality of the air navigation services provided daily to millions of consumers."
"The interinstitutional agreement that was reached shows that it was possible to improve this regulatory framework, in accordance with the Treaties; to acknowledge the rights of Member States to exercise their sovereignty over the airspace above their territories; to safeguard existing international agreements, such as the agreement in force that gives Portugal (through its control centre on Santa Maria, in the Azores) control over North Atlantic air traffic; to establish flight information regions, known as functional airspace blocks, by means of agreement with the Member States concerned; and to license air navigation service providers."
"Most importantly, emphasis was also placed on safety considerations, with increased technical cooperation and interoperability, coordination with the military aviation authorities and the sovereign rights of Member States in the sphere of air navigation."
"I voted in favour and naturally welcome the meeting of minds that made it possible to …"
". – The draft joint regulation currently before us has, out of the entire legislative package on the Single European Sky, given rise to more doubts at first reading than any other."
"This regulation contains a separation of functions between national supervisory authorities and service providers, which will enable the various authorities to opt for the service provider of their choice, under a non-discriminatory system of charging."
"Although it is acknowledged that the services in question are clearly of public interest, this option is extended to operators in the private sector too."
"In its proposals, the Commission considered and addressed airspace management as if it were like any other economic service, comparable to the liberalised telecommunications or transport services markets, under the supervision of a European regulator."
"The text that has been agreed on steers clear of this approach, because it not only expressly states that each Member State can, within its own airspace, designate a service provider of its choice – under the auspices of national supervisory authorities and without deferring to other bodies – as a means of protecting total freedom for the ways and means of achieving this."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"I would also highlight the introduction of the concept of ‘experience in the field’ as a criterion for selecting organisations recognised by the national authorities, with mutual recognition of licences and the development of training programmes for controllers."
"– Although the need for airspace to be delineated, regulated and strategically managed at European level is not in question, we must, at the very least, be cautious in this context about adopting functional airspace blocks (to replace the current flight information regions, where this is justified) that do not correspond to national borders."
"It should be recalled that the Commission’s original proposals completely ignored the unique and vital nature of the services in question and their relationship with the exercise of Member States’ public powers."
"Nevertheless, the text now before us remedies these shortcomings by giving the Member States exclusive competence for delineating the functional blocks in question – since these cannot be changed by the EU – and acknowledges the need to ensure that minimum public interest requirements are met."
"These will enable the best use to be made of airspace, taking account of air traffic flows and giving the various authorities the option to select a service provider of their own choosing."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"I share the rapporteur’s position on the need, in pursuing a common transport policy, for measures to be adopted on systems, components and procedures that will facilitate real interoperability of the European air traffic management network."
"In fact, unless there is some harmonisation and standardisation of operational rules, on procedures and equipment – thereby ensuring complementarity and consistency for rules and standards – it will be hard to establish a network that actually benefits all Member States."
"The low level of integration of national air traffic management systems and the slow rate of introducing the operational and technological standards necessary to obtain the sought-after additional capacity are the result of the fragmentation of the systems market and of the consequent lack of industrial cooperation."
"This has led to unnecessary delays in developing and implementing new technologies and to a slow pace for introducing the means and concepts necessary for a much-needed increase in operational capacity."
"I would emphasise that this interpretation does not mean sticking to uniform approaches; instead, it expresses the view that measures must be confined to what is strictly necessary to ensuring the desired interoperability."
"I must also issue a warning about the risk of business concentration that adopting these measures could entail and I believe that, rightly ..."
". The aim of the proposal for a directive of 12 July 2002 on public contracts is to open up public markets and to establish a European internal market in the sector, in line with the objectives of the ‘Lisbon Strategy’."
"The award of public contracts generates a significant market that is highly tempting for the private sector. It also constitutes an important instrument of economic policy with a potential socio-economic impact."
"Once again, in the name of transparency, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, and with public companies at a disadvantage, the decisive factor in awarding contracts is price."
"This leaves the markets wide open for foreign companies to come in, which may lead to job losses, undermine regional development and adversely affect national economies. In Portugal, for example, there is a danger that more companies may go the way of the former Sorefame and the Viana do Castelo naval yards."
"This instrument could, however, have introduced other criteria for awarding contracts and in so doing could have provided targeted support for certain countries or regions to pursue economic, social and environmental objectives chosen by individual countries."
"In this regard, while we welcome recent decisions made by the Court of Justice, conferring on the contracting authority the right to select its criteria, the framework remains very limited."
"We therefore voted against the common position of Parliament and the Council."
". The aim of both proposals for directives, one general and the other sectoral, is to replace the four existing texts in order to simplify and modernise EU provisions relating to the award of public contracts."
"This is something I naturally welcome. The new provisions must ensure that the internal market works better and must ensure greater transparency in the awarding of contracts."
"I therefore welcome the outcome finally achieved in Conciliation, particularly on the final point on which there was still a difference of opinion: defining criteria for awarding contracts."
"The system has improved substantially and has become easier to understand, thereby facilitating the free movement of goods relating to public supply contracts, freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services relating to the award of public service contracts and of public works contracts in Member States by the State, regional and local authorities and other public bodies."
"I also endorse the proposal to encourage the use of electronic signatures as a way of guaranteeing and reinforcing the confidentiality of proposals."
"Lastly, I welcome the call, also agreed in Conciliation, for Member States to guarantee that these directives can be implemented using mechanisms that are effective, accessible and transparent."
". The aim of the reform of legislation currently before us on public contracts in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors is to open up markets and to establish a genuine internal European market in these sectors."
"The Commission’s proposal for a directive of 12 July 2002 complements the ongoing process of liberalisation in the energy, postal services and transport sectors, in line with the aims and targets set out in the ‘Lisbon Strategy’. It also advocates opening up water management to the private sector."
"In this regard, public contracts stand in stark contrast to public service supply and, in the case of water, their purpose is to guarantee a legal framework for awarding contracts to private firms, which is current practice in various local authorities in Portugal."
"It is odd, to say the least, that in the report on services of general interest in the last plenary session, Parliament displayed its opposition to opening up the water supply market, while here it tacitly accepts such a move."
"We therefore voted against the common position of the Council and Parliament, although we do acknowledge some improvements on the original proposal."
"– Two pieces of Community legislation are being amended today: one on the procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts and the other on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors."
"We find these changes, which are based on the principles of free competition in an open market, worrying, coming as they do at a time when France is moving towards greater decentralisation and is engaging in a national review of public procurement."
"We want to ensure that the public services concerned continue to cover the same geographical area and provide the same services."
"We are therefore voting against these two directives."
"Mr President, my Group voted against this agreement."
"We agree that some good things were agreed in the review of the packaging directive."
"However, there is a major problem in that the agreement itself violates the spirit of the landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice, in procedural terms both in terms of the substance and the letter of the European Treaties."
"In February, the European Court of Justice ruled that waste incineration in municipal waste incinerators could not be counted as a form of recovery, even if energy was generated as a result."
"The Council, however, instead of increasing recycling or environmentally sound recovery to meet the recovery target, insisted on putting incineration on an equal footing with recovery, contrary to the ECJ ruling."
"Although this issue was not a subject for conciliation as no parliamentary amendment to the Council’s common position had been adopted, by bringing it into the conciliation process the Council violated Article 251(4) of the EC Treaty."
"My Group very much disagrees with the procedure and the result of the conciliation."
"We also find it very alarming that incineration, which we consider detrimental to the environment, has actually now been included as something to aim for."
". I commend the rapporteur for her excellent work on this crucial report."
"I fully support the aims of the Commission proposal in this area."
"We are all agreed that our consumer society is producing far too much waste packaging material and that various measures are needed to reduce the quantities."
"Recycling clearly has a major role to play in this process."
"Indeed, this strategy ties in well with the priorities of the Irish presidency in the environment area, recently outlined in Parliament by Minister Cullen."
"I am pleased that the final agreement allows Ireland sufficient time to put the necessary infrastructure in place to deal with this important legislation."
"As an island nation with a relatively small population, we have some very obvious disadvantages compared to our continental neighbours."
"Our location puts us at considerable distance from the main recycling markets and there are extra shipping costs involved."
"I am satisfied that the derogation secured by Ireland to the end of 2011 will afford us the opportunity to implement this directive in a meaningful way."
"In conclusion, I also support other measures which seek to reduce packaging waste, such as targeted taxation suggested by the Irish presidency, for example to deal with fast-food packaging."
". I endorse this report, which addresses a question that is crucial in terms of its impact on the lives of EU citizens."
"The purpose of approving a new legal instrument, a directive, is to reduce the amount of packaging and other polluting waste products, by setting out a series of bolder objectives than those provided in the previous directive, which is still in force today."
"The most significant moves are to raise the compulsory minimum level of recycling of packaging waste from 25% to 55% by 2008 and to provide a series of specific actions aimed at recovering and recycling the various materials commonly used in the manufacture of packaging."
"I endorse the idea that return, collection and recovery systems in Member States must be open to all interested parties and must avoid discrimination against imported products and against heavier materials."
"While I understand that, in the absence of adequate infrastructure, the targets that have been set are utterly unrealistic, I am bitterly disappointed that as far as my country is concerned, along with Greece and Ireland, the implementation of this new directive has been postponed until the end of 2011."
"I voted in favour."
"– Mr President, it is part of the European Parliament’s legislative activities in the Community to undertake the difficult and sensitive role of controller of the executive authority in all of its forms."
"When carrying out its tasks, it has to assess the gravity of the lapses that inevitably occur at any time and in any place as a result of human nature; it has to be conscientious in exercising control but must do so without stifling initiatives and, above all, it should act in the general interest and avoid taking sides."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament has not managed to comply with these rules, neither in the Eurostat affair nor in respect of the Committee of the Regions."
"That is why I voted against."
"Mr President, I would like to explain why our group, the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has abstained on Amendment No 1 in Mr Casaca’s report."
"The word ‘abstention’ is reminiscent of certain expressions commonly used in surveys such as ‘do not know, no comment’ and, in this case, we believe that we Members of this Parliament do not yet know either the magnitude of the facts, in relation to Eurostat, or the possible responsibilities stemming from them."
"And ‘no comment’, in the sense that OLAF, a body responsible for combating fraud, has not provided this Parliament or any of its committees with adequate information in this regard, which could provide a detailed and complete picture of the situation."
"Under these circumstances, a vote in favour of the amendment would imply that we had full knowledge of the facts and that as a result we were passing judgment in terms of certain responsibilities."
"A vote against would also mean having knowledge of the facts and drawing a line under the issue as if it had already finished, without clarifying responsibilities."
"It was therefore better to await any news which may arrive from OLAF."
"I cannot end without saying that we believe Parliament has shown incoherence this morning, and the majority has rejected the individual responsibility of Commissioners, immediately after an individualised reference, which, in our opinion, is unfair, since it is untimely, partial and hasty."
"We trust that OLAF will soon provide the information we need in order to issue a reasoned judgment."
"We believe that what is termed the Eurostat affair has revealed that reforms are required within the Commission regarding the control and monitoring of the EU authorities’ activities."
"We believe, however, that to demand Commissioner Solbes’ resignation would be too far-reaching and not very constructive."
"The Commission has acknowledged that mistakes have been made and, in our opinion, it is now up to the Commission, together with other institutions, to find models for a more effective and more transparent system of internal control."
"If the Commission does not present a better system, a debate can begin about not granting discharge for 2002."
".– I entirely endorse the Casaca report, which states that, at the time that Parliament gave discharge in respect of the budget for the 2001 financial year, it had not been made aware of certain important items of information, particularly on the Eurostat affair."
"Like Mr Casaca, I denounce the Commission’s withholding of information, its ‘culture of secrecy, complexity and lack of clarity’, and the Commissioners’ failure to face up to their political responsibilities (paragraph 24)."
"It is necessary, though, to take this argument to its logical conclusion by also stating what has brought about this culture of opaqueness bordering on arrogance: it is a consequence of the privileged position accorded to the Commission among the institutions, and of the sense of superiority which follows from it, and it is this sense of superiority that it is desired to bolster by means of the European Constitution."
"The Casaca report also highlights two other intolerable states of affairs."
"The first of these is the Commissioners’ lack of any clear and effective authority over their directors-general (paragraph 29), which means that the Commission’s departments have become fiefdoms in the true sense of the word."
"There is also the Commission’s consistent refusal to investigate the real ownership of companies applying for contracts and grants from the Commission, especially when there are strong suspicions that Commission officials are their true owners (paragraph 47)."
". This report concentrates mainly on the Eurostat case and the irregularities that have been detected since 1999."
"Let us not forget that Eurostat has been reaping the consequences of the Commission’s policy of outsourcing services, which has led to irregularities, fraud, nepotism and cronyism. It is also true that services carried out by private firms have been of a lower quality than the Commission’s internal services."
"We welcome the proposals to keep Eurostat services in-house and to review current contracts."
"As for relations between Eurostat and National Statistics Services, we must not overlook issues of data protection regarding information passed between administrations."
"The recent case undermines the credibility of the Commission’s administrative reform and shows the way in which internal information structures become corrupted, in which the prevailing culture of secrecy has given rise to ‘financial envelope systems’ in Eurostat and in which the information and communication systems within the Commission have managed to remain oblique."
"Consequently, we regret the fact that the President of the Commission did not propose structural changes to relations between Commissioners and directorates-general, that he did not reach any conclusions regarding the Commissioners’ political responsibilities and that he did not condemn Mr Solbes Mira, the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, for not acting sooner, in the face of mounting evidence of irregular financial management."
"I chose to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 13 to 17 and, in that way, went against the line taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"The reason for this is that these amendments are keenly critical of the serious irregularities at Eurostat."
"I also voted in favour of Amendment No 21 which regrets the fact that Commissioner Solbes Mira, the Commissioner directly responsible for Eurostat’s administration, did not act sooner in response to the unsatisfactory state of affairs and that he did not accept political responsibility."
"I also supported Amendment No 1, expressing the view that the accountability of the Commission would be strengthened in the future if the Commissioners accepted that they had individual political responsibility for their departments."
"The report as such was constructive, however, and I therefore voted for it in the final vote."
"The report was adopted by 467 votes in favour, with 11 votes against and 9 abstentions."
".Satellite navigation is a particularly important space application with many uses: in shipping, in aircraft navigation, even in search and rescue operations."
"The development of the Galileo satellite navigation system by the EU would be a contribution to mankind if, despite assurances that it is a purely non-military system, there was not every indication that the European imperialists also intend it to be used for military purposes, within the framework of their ambition to share the role of global policeman with the USA."
"Among other things in yesterday's debate, Commissioner De Palacio mentioned that the system will have, over and above the signals to which everyone will have access, some signal to which only the states will have access."
"Although the report by Mr Pietrasanta has several positive points in comparison with previous reports on this matter, it leaves a number of questions on military use unanswered."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
"I voted against the resolution on European Space Policy as all amendments concerning the need to guarantee the peaceful use of outer-space were not carried. This illustrates the real intentions lying behind the desire for an EU space policy - it is driven by the desire to establish the EU as a military superpower."
"The inclusion of China in EU space policy, and Galileo in particular, is not acceptable until China becomes a fully democratic state and recognises basic human rights."
"Galileo was sold to the European Parliament as a civil project, and that is what it should remain."
"This is one of the main arguments in favour of a European satellite system given that the American GPS system is a military project which the US Government can jam at any moment."
"With the inclusion of the fifth application - the Public Regulated Service or PRS - it is impossible to guarantee that this encrypted signal, which is reserved for the State, will not be used for military purposes."
"Given its future military application and China's inclusion in the project I voted against the report."
". As stated in the Commission’s original proposal, this technology has clear strategic importance and may also generate significant economic benefits."
"The current systems in the US (GPS) and Russia (GLONASS) are both financed and run by the military, which means that signals may be interrupted or tampered with at any moment in order to protect the national interest."
"Galileo straightaway has the distinction of being a strictly civilian project, and so it must remain."
"It is, moreover, increasingly seen as an important means of protecting nature and of managing and conserving natural resources."
"We are already seeing its uses in agriculture and in civil defence (helping to select crops or predicting natural disasters)."
"Other areas such as air, sea and river transport will benefit enormously from the emergence of this European technology."
"I welcome the fact that the project is on schedule, and the fact that EGNOS, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service – a system intended to strengthen the GPS signal, especially in civil aviation – is expected to be fully operational by April 2004."
"I should lastly like to underline the need to ensure that it remains free or almost free for users of basic services ..."
"– Mr President, the European Parliament’s adoption today of the new resolution on the Draft European Constitution is a tacit recognition that it was wrong to ask the Italian Presidency to achieve the impossible, which is what it did in the proposal that we adopted in December."
"The European Parliament would grow in stature if it were to acknowledge this explicitly, but no one is perfect."
"It also goes without saying that the European Parliament should at least examine the written results of the Naples Conclave before expressing an opinion on their value, which it has just done, because these written results were submitted to the Heads of State or Government by the Italian Presidency."
"I deplore the fact that in almost two months, Parliament still has not considered doing so."
"Having said this, the Draft Constitution remains a bad and dangerous initiative and I still do not see any reason therefore to hope that it will be adopted at either Easter or Trinity."
"That is why I voted against."
"Mr President, I also voted against this resolution."
"It is not in the interests of European citizens or in the interests of the European Union as whole."
"It is regrettable that there is such a mad rush to finalise this by May."
"It is completely unacceptable."
"The Convention was not set up specifically to draft a constitution for Europe."
"Something like this needs a lot more time."
"There needs to be a lot more consultation with the public in general: that is why I voted against it."
"It is also regrettable if the Irish presidency is being forced and pressurised into finding some agreement on this during its term of office."
"It is wrong to imply that somehow the Irish presidency may be a failure if this issue does not go through."
"There is plenty of time: we have years to go in relation to this."
"Let the ten new countries in and let them find their feet first before we start rushing into further European integration."
".– In its resolution on the Irish presidency’s programme, Parliament is attempting to rush the IGC’s negotiations by demanding that it finalise a text for the Constitution before 1 May 2004, which is the date of enlargement."
"I did not vote in favour of this demand, as the Member States must be allowed time to see precisely where this bad document would take them."
"The Council’s statements, however, have shown us that it has had a sudden attack of the scruples over the plan for a single statute for MEPs."
"I can do no other than take satisfaction in this, having for years been a constant opponent of this plan for reasons that can all be found in my previous interventions, notably those on 17 December of last year."
"The Council, which had for years turned a deaf ear to these arguments, has suddenly started to listen to them as the elections draw near."
"Whereas, until now, it appeared to entertain the idea of making MEPs financially independent of their countries, the prospect of the voters’ dissatisfaction with this improper inducement has brought it to its senses."
"I conclude that this is much the same thing as is happening with the draft European Constitution."
"Elections are the beginning of wisdom."
". Pressure aimed at forcing through the so-called ‘European Constitution’ is coming from all sides; from government representatives – special mention here goes to France and Germany – from the Commission, Parliament, and from the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations in Europe (UNICE), which has reaffirmed its eagerness for ‘urgent agreement on the EU draft Constitution’."
"In light of the first ministerial-level meeting of the Irish Presidency, which centred on what should be done in the near future – and in which, according to the minutes..., the proposal of the ‘European Constitution’ as a basis for negotiation drafted by the ‘Convention’ and the desire to reach agreement before Parliamentary elections in June will have been reaffirmed – Parliament once again welcomes such an approach and urges reaching agreement by 1 May."
"The forces and interests behind the so-called ‘European Constitution’ – namely, major capital and the most powerful countries in the EU – have once again begun to mobilise. All of which vindicates those of us who have been the first to denounce the real motives and the real dangers of the ‘European Constitution’ and the first to call for it to be rejected out of hand."
". The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs clearly endorses the aims of competition policy, namely to establish free, competitive and open markets, and to promote the completion of the internal market."
"Stressing the primacy of competition over other considerations, be they economic, social or environmental, results in policies aimed at liberalising and deregulating the markets, in addition to a fundamental bias against State intervention in the economy, especially through State aid."
"This proposal welcomes the 32nd Report on Competition Policy; it endeavours to reduce the procedures for monitoring company mergers; it endeavours to impose stricter controls on State aid, and indeed fights to reduce this type of aid; it welcomes the opening up of the gas and electricity markets; it foments mistrust of publicly owned companies; it calls for the media sector to be open and competitive and calls for overcompensations in public service broadcasting to be monitored; it seeks to create a new institutional chamber to speed up the processes of competition policy; it seeks to hold periodic calls for tender to award contracts for services of general interest."
"This is why we voted against the resolution."
"– This resolution is a veritable eulogy of the globalist policy of free trade that is decimating our industry and our jobs and as such is an insult to the men and women who, each day, pay the highest possible price for the consequences of this ultra-liberal European economic policy, from which only a handful of faceless and stateless shareholders benefit."
"Entrusted to European civil servants who kowtow to the powerful lobbies emerging in Brussels, European competition policy is the main vector for ultra-liberal globalisation in our countries."
"Bureaucratic control of cartels, abuses of dominant position and concentrations; strict supervision of public aids disbursed to companies in difficulty; submission of public services to market rule; dismantling of customs protection which, in the past, safeguarded our economic interests: the record of the European Commission and its accomplices is absolutely disastrous."
"As someone who comes from a region of France that has fallen victim to this absurd policy, I know what all of this neglect has cost the French in terms of relocation, a decline in industrial activity (textiles, steel and agri-food), the destruction of SMEs and, of course, in terms of unemployment, insecurity and poverty."
"That is why, contrary to the representatives of the bankruptcy association sitting on the right and left of this House, I categorically reject this text."
"Mr President, the link between the common foreign and security policy and space policy is very clear, both in the Commission's White Paper and in the resolution."
"A lot of people think this is quite acceptable, but I do not think it is acceptable that the European Union should want to be a military super power."
"To be a credible military super power, of course, it needs a space policy."
"The Galileo technology is a very precise type of technology which will be used for military means."
"There are a lot more important areas into which EU resources could be going, rather than this: it is clearly in the interests of the military."
"It is completely unacceptable that the space policy and EU resources should be funding and facilitating military expansion or the development of new military weapons."
"But is it right that European taxpayers’ money should be going into something like this when people all over Europe are crying out for essential social needs?"
"Such huge resources are being poured into this and it is not acceptable."
"That is why I do not support it."
".The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution on space policy in accordance with everything I said in my position yesterday and, furthermore, because the amendments which we proposed against the use of space for military purposes and to serve defence and security policy were not accepted."
"We condemn the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (including New Democracy) which voted almost in its entirety against the amendments, as well as the stand taken by the socialist group (including PASOK) which, while voting in favour of the amendment which accepted the principle of the use of space solely for peaceful purposes, at the same time voted against an identical amendment opposing the use of space for military activities!"
"We believe that this inconstant behaviour is not the result of a split personality."
"It is simply an artifice, an attempt to muddy the waters, an alibi to cover their all-round support for the militarisation of the European Union and the militarisation of space."
"We have today voted in favour of the present resolution on EU space policy, just as we previously supported the own-initiative report on the Commission’s Green Paper on European space policy on 9 October 2003 and the report on Europe and space on 17 January 2002."
"We would however emphasise that the EU’s commitment to the area of space policy should be based upon the agreement between the EC and the European Space Agency (ESA) from 2003 and be limited to the competence the EU now has in the area of space research."
"We reject an increased EU competence planned to be included in the treaty for establishing a European Constitution."
"European industrial cooperation in the area of space should mainly be conducted on an intergovernmental basis in accordance with the Convention for the establishment of a European Space Agency."
". I feel that it is very important that cooperation should be extended between EU Member States and other European States that have a formidable tradition in research in this field, such as Russia, and countries further afield, in order to harness the potential for space exploration for peaceful purposes."
"This will make a significant contribution towards addressing the serious problems and meeting the urgent needs faced by the human race."
"I therefore deplore the fact that most Members of this House voted against the proposals for amendments tabled by my group, which sought to ensure that ‘space must be used solely for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of the entire human race’ and which vehemently oppose ‘any use of space for developing or supporting military activities’."
"We are equally appalled that this House has called on the EU to make ‘a significant financial commitment that specifically provides for developing space-based research into global security’, acknowledging the contribution that the ‘space policy could make to Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policy’ and calling for defence-related companies to coordinate programmes in order to achieve this objective. Space policy would thus become part of the framework of the militarisation of space, something that I find deeply worrying."
"I therefore voted against."
"– As usual, the European Parliament has debated the future of an industrial sector without considering the workers who keep it going, if only in a secondary role."
"For us, it is not a question of knowing whether that sector is competitive or not compared with products from elsewhere, and even less of advising the owners of the companies concerned how to become more competitive."
"Whether the textiles industry is competitive or not, it is deplorable that 850 000 jobs should have been axed!"
"We are opposing this text, not because the textiles industry needs to be protected, but because its workers do, in the same way that we need to protect workers in other sectors, such as aeronautics or information technology, which are laying off just as many staff because they need to modernise."
"We are against the stupid market economy and against competition, for which the company owners and shareholders make the workers pay the full cost."
"In this competitive environment, it is not only the workers in poor countries, exploited and forced to earn low salaries, who lose out, but also the workers in the so-called rich countries, who are thrown out onto the streets by their employers."
"All the more reason why we are against workers in different countries being forced to compete against each other."
". I am delighted that the EP resolution before us includes two of my proposals, which I consider to be important means of supporting the textiles and clothing sector in the EU and in Portugal."
"The first of these is to create a specific Community programme for the sector – with appropriate support mechanisms – especially for less favoured regions that depend on the sector, aimed at boosting research, innovation, vocational training and SMEs. The second is to set up a Community programme to stimulate brand creation and to encourage product promotion further afield, such as at international trade fairs."
"I regret the fact, however, that other proposals were not accepted, such as the need for a genuine action plan that is specific, cohesive and clear, with regard to instruments, financial means and a timetable; the need for a production chain mentality; and the need for a sectoral approach in negotiations with the WTO, so that the sector does not simply become a bargaining chip."
"I also deplore the fact that the liberalisation approach has not been called into question and I am gravely concerned about the risks of relocation in the sector."
"A thorough evaluation must be carried out into the impact of unbridled liberalisation in the sector, especially now that the Textiles and Clothing Agreement has come to an end and that China has joined the WTO."
"I take note of the Commission Communication on the future of the textiles and clothing sector in the European Union."
"I cannot but support the parliamentary resolution on this issue."
"Faced with the challenges and dangers represented by the end of quotas on imports, the recent entry of China into the WTO, ‘imminent’ completion of the Doha round and the enlargement of the European Union, it is our duty to act to protect this sector."
"We can only encourage the measures that seek to favour new information and communication technologies and training."
"Adaptability is essential in this sector where methods change so much."
"It is an essential competitive advantage faced with imports from Asia."
"Research is, of course, equally essential."
"All this is not, however, enough to preserve a viable textile sector in Europe because China is also committed to research and to products with a high added value and never has any difficulty in quickly copying our innovations."
"This is why I particularly support the amendments calling for real support for the European textile and clothing sector and of the regions that are home to it through a specific Community programme."
". I welcome and endorse the motion for a resolution on the future of the European textiles and clothing sector."
"After the impending enlargement and liberalisation, I sincerely hope that the recommendations contained in this proposal do not turn out to be mere declarations of good intent and are in fact translated into visible, concrete action."
"This is the only way in which jobs can be guaranteed in the sector and in which we can safeguard what remains of Europe’s textiles and clothing industry."
"The unilateral abolition of import quotas, set for 1 January 2005, places the textiles industries of EU Member States on an unequal footing compared with other producers around the world."
"International trade will only be free, fair and equal if some measure of reciprocity can be guaranteed."
"The EU and its Member States must establish support programmes and incentives for SMEs, so as to stimulate investment in research and development."
"I also welcome the greater emphasis that will be placed on problems related to protecting intellectual and industrial property, and most importantly on the fight against counterfeiting."
"I feel that greater attention should be paid to the case of China. Specific measures must be taken to combat China’s hegemony in the textiles and clothing sector."
"Only high quality production will give the European industry competitive clout in the current context, given ..."
"That concludes the vote.(2)"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"Mr Secretary-General, President-in-Office of the Council, High Representative, Commissioners, colleagues and distinguished guests, it is a great pleasure for me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to welcome here today the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan."
"I would also like to welcome the previous Sakharov Prize laureates who join us today: the President of East Timor, Mr Xanana Gusmão; the President of Kosovo, Mr Ibrahim Rugova; from China, Mr Wei Jingsheng; from Algeria, Ms Salima Ghezali; from Spain, representatives of ¡Basta Ya!; and from Angola, Dom Zacharias Kamwenho."
"Allow me also to recall some laureates who are absent: her continuing fight for freedom and democracy in her own country prevents Aung San Suu Kyi from joining us; from Turkey, Leyla Zana sends greetings of support and solidarity; in Cuba and not free to attend, Oswaldo Payá sends his greetings."
"This is an important occasion for the European Parliament, both symbolic and solemn."
"Symbolic, because today affords us, the European Parliament and the United Nations, an opportunity to mark and to celebrate the values and the public purpose that we share and hold in common."
"Ours is a Union based on values of pluralist democracy, respect for the rule of law, the promotion of individual and minority rights, solidarity, sustainability, open economy and respect for cultural diversity."
"Arguably, our European Union is the most successful conflict resolution process the world has seen and we are proud of that."
"This House strongly believes in the value and worth of the United Nations and its Charter, and in multilateralism."
"We are resolved to make our positive contribution to ensure that, in meeting the challenges and duties of the 21st century, multilateralism can and shall be effective."
"We support the fight against global terrorism, but we also insist on recognising the duty to fight against global poverty."
"As regards weapons of mass destruction, we stand firmly on the side of non-proliferation, but our instinctive European response is for engagement and not for isolation."
"We have a responsibility to the security of our citizens in the Union to ensure that our borders are not porous or open to international trafficking and crime, and yet we also have a duty before humanity not to be a 'fortress Europe'."
"Let me tell you, Mr Secretary-General, that as Europeans, our Union and its Member States are proud to be the largest donor community of untied development assistance, humanitarian aid and food aid in the world."
"We are proud of what we do, but we accept that we could and should do more."
"We in the Parliament are proud of our commitment in this Union to the politics of sustainability – locally and globally – not least in our constant promotion of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Our belief in the rule of law has galvanised this House into being one of the earliest, most consistent and most vocal supporters of the International Criminal Court."
"I can tell you, Mr Secretary-General, that we should prefer the due process of the International Criminal Court, any day, to the absence of due process in Guantanamo Bay."
"Our pledge to you today, Mr Secretary-General, is for Europe, in all of its manifestations, to be a reliable regional partner for the United Nations and what it stands for."
"Of course, today sees us gathered here, not just for its symbolic value, but also for a solemn purpose."
"On 19 August 2003, in Baghdad, terrorism reached a new low, when 22 of your colleagues paid the ultimate price in the service of peace and international humanity."
"Joining us today – and I would ask those who can to stand and be recognised – are the relatives of some of those who paid that price, and some of the survivors."
"I should like to welcome to our Chamber Mrs Annie de Mello, widow of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and her son Mr Laurent de Mello; Ms Rula Al-Farra, sister of Ms Reham Al-Farra; and Mr Luís Martín-Oar and his wife."
"As I remarked, we are also joined today by a number of those who survived that vicious assault: Ms Nada Al-Nashif, Mrs Mona Rishmawi and Professor Gil Loescher, you are also very welcome here today."
"You honour us with your presence today."
"Permit me to say to all of you that we know we cannot compensate your loss, but I hope you now understand that we have felt it."
"Finally, Mr Secretary-General – and this is why we are solemnly gathered here today – I should like to say to you on behalf of this Parliament that for defending freedom and for promoting the values we have in common, it is my privilege to award to you, the United Nations, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize."
". Mr President, thank you for that very kind introduction."
"Members of the European Parliament, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen and dear friends, I am deeply touched that you have honoured my friend and colleague, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and the many other UN staff who lost their lives in working for peace in the world."
"I am proud to accept the Sakharov prize in memory of them."
"This prize for freedom of thought is not only a worthy recognition of the ultimate sacrifice that they made in the cause of peace."
"It is also a welcome acknowledgement of the kinds of people they were."
"The brave men and women we lost in Baghdad on 19 August – UN staff and others – were free spirits and free thinkers and also soldiers of humanity and of peace."
"Earlier, President Cox and I met some of the survivors of the attack and family members of those who were killed or injured."
"They are with us in the Chamber now."
"I thank them for joining us today and I accept this prize in their name too."
"I also thank you, President Cox, and all of you, as Members of the European Parliament, for inviting these special people to share this occasion."
"It is a gesture that speaks volumes about the solidarity of the European Union with the United Nations."
"Like many who survived the blast, the United Nations itself carries deep wounds."
"But our determination is stronger than ever, and we value the solidarity of friends like you."
"You showed your commitment this morning, when you adopted a resolution to strengthen the EU’s political and financial support for the United Nations."
"In its long history, Europe has seen more than its fair share of war, tyranny and terrible suffering."
"But Europeans have replaced that with a future of hope."
"You have pursued the path of peace through multilateralism."
"And today, the European Union is a shining light of tolerance, human rights, and international cooperation."
"After 1 May this year, that light will shine even brighter."
"When you enlarge to 25 Member States, you will cross a divide between east and west that once seemed unbridgeable."
"Enlargement is the greatest force for peace on the European continent."
"The hope for further enlargement in years to come promises to build other bridges of cooperation and understanding – including between the West and Islam, and between peoples who have fought each other in bloody wars."
"As time goes by, the continent is also experiencing an enlargement of what it means to be European."
"I look forward to the day when Europe rejoices as much in diversity within States as it does in diversity between them."
"Many of your societies are already very diverse."
"But all of your societies – and many others around the world too – will become more diverse in the decades to come."
"This is the inevitable result of the movement of people across international borders."
"That movement is not going to stop."
"As an international community, we need to manage the movement of people across borders far better than we do ..."
"... not just for the sake of those who move, but for the sake of the countries they leave behind and those they travel through and those they migrate to."
"People migrate today for the same reasons that tens of millions of Europeans once left your shores – they flee war or oppression, or they leave in search of a better life in a new land."
"Those who are forced out of their homes – the refugees who flee in fear for their safety – are our collective legal and moral responsibility."
"We have an agreed legal framework for their protection – the 1951 Refugee Convention."
"However, when refugees cannot seek asylum because of offshore barriers, or are detained for excessive periods in unsatisfactory conditions, or are refused entry because of restrictive interpretations of the Convention, the asylum system is broken and the promise of the Convention is broken too."
"Your asylum system needs the resources to process claims fairly, quickly, and openly so that refugees are protected and solutions found for them."
"European States need to move towards a system of joint processing and sharing of responsibilities."
"Along with others, the EU must also help strengthen the capacity of poor countries to provide protection and solutions for refugees."
"After all, seven out of ten refugees seek refuge in developing countries, where resources are far more stretched and human rights standards more uneven."
"If we ignore this fact, there is a missing link in our approach to refugees – as Professor Gil Loescher, who survived the Baghdad blast and is with us here today, has rightly pointed out."
"Most immigrants are not refugees."
"We call them voluntary migrants – and some of them truly are."
"However, many leave their home countries not because they really want to, but because they see no future at home."
"It is our shared duty to do what we can to ensure that there are more opportunities in developing countries."
"If we truly forge a global partnership for development, in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, we will do a lot to reduce the incentive for people to leave."
"Your asylum systems are overburdened precisely because many people who feel they must leave see no other channel through which to migrate."
"Many others try more desperate and clandestine measures, and are sometimes injured or even killed – suffocating in trucks, drowning at sea, or perishing in the undercarriage of aircraft."
"The lucky ones who get in often find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, and alienated from society."
"Some resort to people smugglers to assist their journey."
"Others fall victim to traffickers – especially women, who are forced into prostitution in a modern form of sex slavery, and become acutely vulnerable to HIV/AIDS."
"This silent human rights crisis shames our world."
"It also generates billions of dollars for shadowy networks of organised criminals, who subvert the rule of law in all societies where they operate."
"It is the sovereign right of all states to decide which voluntary migrants they will accept, and on what terms."
"But we cannot simply close our doors, or shut our eyes to this human tragedy."
"The situation is all the more tragic given that many States which close their doors actually immigrants."
"Here in Europe, your birth rates and death rates have dropped dramatically."
"Your populations are getting smaller and growing older."
"Without immigration, the population of the soon-to-be 25 Member States of the EU – 452 million in 2000 – would drop to under 400 million people by 2050."
"Some states – such as Italy, Austria, Germany and Greece – would see their populations drop by around a quarter."
"That would mean that one in three Italians, for example, would be over the age of 65 – nearly double the proportion today."
"Were this to happen, jobs would go unfilled and services undelivered."
"Your economies would shrink and your societies could stagnate."
"Many other countries – from Japan, to the Russian Federation, to South Korea – face the same problem."
"There is no simple solution to this problem."
"But immigration is inevitably an important part of the solution."
"I would therefore encourage European states to open up greater avenues for legal migration ..."
"... for skilled and unskilled workers, for family reunification and economic improvement, for temporary and permanent migrants."
"Poor countries reap benefits from migration too – through remittances."
"The amounts which migrant workers send back to their countries of origin are growing fast."
"In 2002, in formal remittances alone, migrants from developing countries sent back at least USD 88 billion to their countries of origin – that is 54% more than the USD 57 billion those same countries received in overseas development assistance."
"Do not get me wrong, I do not pretend that migration is without problems."
"Immigrants bring to their host communities different cultures and customs, different languages and religions."
"This is a source of enrichment, but it can be a source of discomfort – and even of division and alienation."
"The challenge of integration is real."
"Almost every large new immigrant group has been reviled to some degree in the early days of its establishment."
"The experience of some immigrants today is reminiscent of the hostility that the Huguenots once faced in England, as did the Germans, the Italians and the Irish in the United States, and the Chinese in Australia."
"But the longer perspective is almost always far more positive."
"Integration is a two-way street."
"Immigrants must adjust to their new societies – and societies must adjust too."
"The word 'integrate' literally means 'to make whole'."
"That is the imperative for Europe today."
"Integration of the immigrants who have become permanent members of European society is essential for their productivity and human dignity."
"It is also essential for the functioning of healthy, humane democracies."
"They cannot extract the labour of immigrants and ignore other aspects of their humanity."
"The great Swiss writer Max Frisch said of the European 'guest worker programmes' of the 1960s: 'We wanted workers, but we got people'."
"Acknowledging and responding to that reality is one of your central challenges – a reality that is reflected in the United Nations Migrant Workers Convention, which I urge European states, and indeed all states, to sign and ratify."
"Migration can also cause challenges for the countries migrants leave behind."
"Yes, they may gain remittances."
"However, if they lose contact with their diasporas, they can lose some of their best and brightest talent."
"This opens up new vistas for international cooperation."
"After all, just as developing countries often want to attract emigrants back home, developed countries often have an interest in immigrants returning home after a period of time."
"International cooperation on this and other issues is key to managing migration better."
"In the effort to build better international cooperation, you in the European Union should be where you belong – in the lead."
"You have already given more thought than most regions to this issue – and the Tampere framework is a basis on which to forge a common European policy."
"Combating illegal immigration should be part of a much broader agenda – an agenda to harness the benefits of immigration, rather than vainly trying to stop it."
"But sometimes, the breadth of the agenda has been lost amidst shrill debates about clamping down on illegal immigration – as though that were the major purpose of migration policy."
"The public has been fed images of a flood of unwelcome entrants, and of threats to their societies and identities."
"In the process, immigrants have sometimes been stigmatised, vilified, even de-humanised."
"In the process, an essential truth has also been lost."
"The vast majority of immigrants are industrious, courageous and determined."
"They do not want a free ride."
"They want a fair opportunity."
"They are not criminals or terrorists."
"They are law-abiding."
"They do not want to live apart."
"They want to integrate, while retaining their identity."
"Only through cooperation – bilateral, regional and global – can we build the partnerships between receiver and sender countries that are in the interests of both; explore innovations to make migration a driver for development; fight smugglers and traffickers effectively and agree on common standards for the treatment of immigrants and the management of migration."
"That is why I am particularly glad that, last month, the Global Commission on International Migration was established."
"The Commission is itself a welcome instance of North-South cooperation, co-chaired by distinguished public figures from Sweden and South Africa."
"I thank all states who are supporting this vital work and I hope it will help promote greater public understanding."
"Above all, I hope it will win broad acceptance for a better normative and institutional framework for managing migration at the global level – a framework that has human rights at its centre."
"But the most essential ingredient of all is leadership."
"You, as Members of the European Parliament, have a vital role to play in providing that leadership."
"The message is clear."
"Migrants need Europe, but Europe also needs migrants."
"A closed Europe would be a meaner, poorer, weaker, older Europe."
"An open Europe will be a fairer, richer, stronger, younger Europe – provided you manage migration well."
"We must not minimise the difficulties that migration can bring."
"But let us also rejoice in the enormous contribution that migrants have made in science, academia, sports, the arts, and government – including some of you as Members of this Parliament."
"And let us remember that, without migrants, many health systems would be short-staffed; many parents would not have the home help they need to pursue careers; many jobs that provide services and generate revenue would go unfilled and many societies would age and shrink."
"Migrants are part of the solution, not part of the problem."
"They should not be made the scapegoats for a vast array of social ills."
"The European Union’s anthem, Beethoven’s 'Ode to Joy', speaks of the day when all humans will become brothers."
"If Sergio Vieira de Mello were with us today – and, indeed, if Andrei Sakharov were too – they would say to you what I say to you: the people who move across borders today, in search of a better life for themselves and their families, are our brothers and our sisters too."
"Let us treat them that way."
"In that spirit, in all our common endeavours, let the European Union and the United Nations be beacons of hope for a better future for all mankind."
". Mr President, it is a signal honour to take part in this sitting of the European Parliament for the award of the 2003 Sakharov prize to Secretary-General Annan and the entire United Nations staff, and to commemorate in particular Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello and the many other UN officials who lost their lives in the performance of their duties."
"I can think of no more appropriate designation of a prize for freedom of thought than the name of Andrei Sakharov."
"And I can think of no more fitting recipient of this prize than Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues."
"The enduring value of the Sakharov prize is that it evokes continually the memory and example of an outstanding human rights advocate who lived and worked in circumstances where such advocacy was considered an act of dissidence."
"This prize in his name sends out every year a clear signal of support from Europe to those who are struggling for peace and human rights, often in the face of significant hostility and in conditions of personal risk."
"I believe therefore that the Parliament has made a wise and kind choice in reflecting on and commemorating the enormous sacrifices made by UN personnel in the cause of peace and justice."
"On 19 August 2003 we were all horrified at the appalling attack on the lives of UN personnel in their headquarters in Baghdad."
"Those who carried out this attack struck a violent and cowardly blow at the people best placed and most committed to bringing relief to the Iraqi people."
"The loss of Sergio Vieira de Mello was a cause of particular sadness."
"In my own country, as in many others, the outstanding work done by Mr Vieira de Mello on behalf of the UN, especially in Timor Leste, was widely known and enormously regarded."
"I know that he would have made an enormous contribution as High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"UN personnel throughout the world perform heroic and often unheralded work."
"It is in many ways a pity that the prevailing image of the UN derives so much from the moments of vertiginous political drama in and around the chamber of the Security Council."
"This image misses the depth of the commitment of many unknown UN officials throughout the world, acting as peacekeepers, providing assistance to refugees, developing human rights capacity, coordinating emergency humanitarian assistance and protecting the rights of women and the marginalised."
"The Millennium Summit Declaration referred to the United Nations as ‘the common house of the entire human family’."
"UN staff, in their daily working lives, demonstrate the truth of this description."
"We are indebted to Secretary-General Annan on many levels and for many things."
"This morning, of course, I would draw attention to the courage and the clarity with which he has addressed the challenges facing the multilateral system and role that migration policy can play in it."
"At the General Assembly last September the Secretary-General characterised the position to which the UN had come as ‘a fork in the road’."
"And as recently as last weekend at the World Economic Forum the Secretary-General noted that the conduct of international politics had become less favourable to the maintenance of a stable, equitable and rule-based international order and that the role of the UN itself and the system of collective security were under serious strain."
"It is because of the urgency of this threat that the Council has recommitted itself to effective multilateralism."
"A stronger, international society, a rules-based international order and strong international institutions are critically important EU objectives."
"Central to this is the EU support for a strengthened UN."
"Intensified and effective cooperation between the EU and the UN is a central priority for this presidency."
"It is imperative that the UN be given the means to meet successfully the many and varied challenges of today."
"As the Secretary-General said in his report last year on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, human rights are universal principles, but inspiring as those principles are, they do not implement themselves."
"The multilateral system embodied in the UN Charter is the only way that human rights and humanitarian law can be effectively defended."
"It provides the only real means of addressing the varied threats of today: terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, poverty, hunger and disease; together with new, or rather growing, challenges such as migration – to which the Secretary-General has made particular reference today."
"It is only through being multilateralist that effective action can be taken to meet the Millennium Development Goals, for example, so that the glaring inequalities and unremitting human suffering which in turn create and foster so many threats to peace and security can be meaningfully addressed."
"It is entirely in character that the Secretary-General did not use this occasion to indulge the plaudits that inevitably and rightly come with prestigious prizes such as this."
"Instead he has chosen to direct our attention to the challenges of a major pressing issue, that of migration."
"This is an issue with which my own country has endured historical experience accumulated through generations who migrated from Ireland and made lives for themselves abroad."
"It is now an issue of major global significance which needs to be put higher up the international agenda."
"Globalisation has given rise to an unprecedented movement of people, in turn giving rise to unparalleled challenges."
"Like the Secretary-General I welcome the establishment last month of the Global Commission on International Migration."
"UN High Commissioner for Refugees Lubbers attended the informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Dublin on Thursday last, at which there was a constructive discussion of proposed European asylum and migration legislation."
"This was very useful and we look forward to building on this valuable dialogue with such an important partner, the United Nations."
"In October 1999 the European Council in Tampere agreed on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the EU, firmly rooted in our shared commitment to human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law."
"This freedom is not the exclusive preserve of the Union’s own citizens."
"It must also be available to those whose circumstances lead them justifiably to seek access to our territory."
"In its proposals and actions on immigration and asylum, the Union is committed to taking account of both the humanitarian and economic aspects and to ensuring full respect for the human rights-based principles enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and other international norms."
"We must confront this challenge with effective action based on our ambition in 1999 to complete this agenda by the middle of this year."
"For the European Union, the United Nations is more than a political affiliation."
"As the Nobel Committee stated in awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Kofi Annan and the United Nations staff in 2001, it granted the prize ‘to proclaim that the only negotiable route to global peace and cooperation goes by way of the United Nations’."
"We are deeply grateful therefore to the Secretary-General for his ceaseless work in defending the multilateral system."
"We wish to record our deep appreciation of the UN staff all over the world serving the cause of peace and justice, human rights and development."
"And we remember those among the UN staff who have given their lives in this cause."
"Therefore, Mr. President, let me join you in commending the award of the Sakharov Prize to the United Nations Secretary-General and his staff."
". Mr President, it is, on behalf of the Commission, a particular pleasure to be able to say a few words today as the Secretary-General receives the Sakharov Prize on behalf of the United Nations."
"It is a particular pleasure because it is extremely difficult to recall another occasion on which the aims of an award and its recipient have cohered so perfectly."
"Checking the statute of the prize, I found that it can be awarded for particular achievement in any of four fields: defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, safeguarding the rights of minorities, respect for international law, and the development of democracy and the implementation of the rule of law."
"By my reckoning, that means we should today be awarding the prize four times over."
"It is being given, of course, in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and his life exemplified those values."
"Its barbaric curtailment leaves the world a good deal poorer."
"Sergio Vieira de Mello was an extraordinary man."
"I was privileged to see his work at first hand, in Hong Kong, in Kosovo and in East Timor."
"He was gallant, he was wise, he was dashing, he was principled and he was immensely effective."
"We are very fortunate that the UN is blessed with other, equally talented individuals, and is led by one as well."
"Kofi Annan has made an immense contribution to furthering the effectiveness of the UN – and its constituent parts – where it matters: on the ground, across the globe."
"Under his authority, both in overseeing its peacekeeping operations, and subsequently as Secretary-General, the UN has brought protection, comfort and hope to millions."
"The Secretary-General has done this in the face of unprecedented challenges to the authority and even the fundamental rationale of the organisation."
"He has consistently risen to and overcome those challenges, unflinching and with his dignity wholly intact."
"Right from the start, with the renewal of the United Nations plan for reform, through the review of peacekeeping operations, the Millennium Report, the call to action on HIV/AIDS and the establishment of the current Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, the Secretary-General has ensured that our collective focus is in the right place at the right time."
"He does so once again today with his words on our obligation to develop a viable humane approach to asylum and immigration."
"I make this point as one, like many in this House, who is a descendant of migrants – in my case, of those who fled from the famine and hunger in Ireland in the 19th century to which the Minister referred."
"The Secretary-General has reinvigorated the staple work of the UN institutions, the work that is done by those all-too-frequently unsung heroes: promoting economic development, feeding the hungry and educating the world."
"And he has ensured that this work responds flexibly to challenges never imagined by the founders of the UN: political challenges, military challenges, even medical challenges."
"I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that the Secretary-General’s personality and wisdom exemplify all our warmest and highest aspirations for the institution that he leads, the institution which he has served with such distinction for so many years."
"Like all Members here today, I salute the UN and I salute the Secretary-General with admiration and humility."
"I also commend his speech and the sentiments which underpinned it to the elected members of this Parliament and to those who elect them."
"I hope that in the months ahead these are arguments that we hear put with compassion and commitment to those who will, I trust, be doing their democratic duty."
"– Mr President, Mr Secretary-General Annan, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr High Representative, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is a significant day in the history of the European Parliament, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, extends a very warm welcome to you, Mr Annan."
"When, in the Conference of Presidents and in this House, we voted that you should receive the Sakharov Prize for 2003, we did so gladly and not merely as a matter of political judgment."
"Now, as we offer you our heartfelt gratitude, we remember Sérgio Vieira de Mello and the many who were killed by a murderous terrorist act in Baghdad, we remember the many who have laid down their lives in the service of the United Nations, and, to those members of their families who are here today, we extend our sympathy and express our solidarity."
"Those who work for the United Nations dedicate themselves to human rights and democracy, and so it is only right that the Sakharov Prize should be awarded to the United Nations."
"Today, we remember Andrei Sakharov, whose great intellectual and moral strength can be felt to this day by those who visit his simple grave in the Novodevichy cemetery outside Moscow, and our desire is that the Russian people may follow his example; that, in Russia and around the world, people may bring to life the ideals of Andrei Sakharov, that great physicist, philosopher and campaigner for human rights."
"Today, our thoughts are also with his widow, Yelena Bonner, who shared decades of exile with him and to whom our group awarded the Schuman Medal, and today we greet her in her simple and modest home in Moscow’s Ulitsa Skalova."
"We would have been glad of the presence of the Sakharov Prize laureates Leyla Zana und Oswaldo José Paya Sardiñas, who, along with others, are unable to be with us today."
"Andrei Sakharov once said that the most important voice is the one that cannot be heard, and my hope for the people of Cuba is that they may be enabled to speak clearly."
"Although, Mr Secretary-General, there is much that could be said about immigration, which involves integration, we share the same values of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, so, all things considered, we are taking the same road, and I hope that you will, as Secretary-General, see the day when the European Union, with a seat of its own, can defend these values in the Security Council and in the United Nations."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that it is a great honour to receive the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, today."
"My group had the honour of nominating the Secretary-General for the Sakharov Prize, and I would like to thank the other political groups for having ensured an overwhelming majority in Parliament in order to express a common will to acknowledge the difficult and heroic work of the United Nations and to encourage it to persevere in the noble cause of world peace and stability."
"My group does not just wish to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello and the other victims of an heroic struggle, but also to acknowledge the efforts of many United Nations officials and chiefs who are continuing their work, and I would like to mention two symbolic names, those of Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei, who have done important work in favour of peace and the reduction of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Over the last two years we have not just seen terrorist attacks which have led to the deaths of many innocent people, but also an unprecedented assault on the international institutions, in particular the UN."
"Therefore, Secretary-General, I would like to reaffirm the importance of solidarity and close cooperation between peoples and nations."
"In this regard, you have given us a lesson today on the importance of migrations, and I would say, on behalf of my group, that we thank you for this brave and committed speech because we are living in a world in which globalisation applies to capital, to services and to products; but ..."
"... is not applied to people."
"Taking from your speech the elements which need to be carried out in the European Union, I would also like to offer you our cooperation in the work you have begun on the reform of the United Nations, with a view to ensuring that the UN, together with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the International Labour Organisation, can work together."
"I believe this is a common cause which both the European Union and the United Nations must work on."
"In summary, Mr President, I would also like to say that we are clearly committed to multilateralism as opposed to unilateralism, to preventive action rather than pre-emptive attacks, and that it must not be said that the United Nations is incapable: Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Guatemala, Kosovo, Timor, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Congo demonstrate that the United Nations is necessary and important and is a legitimate and noble cause and that we must support its efforts."
"Secretary-General, Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House echo your words on immigration."
"We recognise the value that immigrants bring to Europe and we understand that closing Europe's front door will only drive the desperate to seek access through the back."
"Many of us were migrants once upon a time and we know how ill it behoves our generation to shut the gates of mercy on mankind."
"A Europe of security and justice for all is a Europe that extends those rights to those who justly seek a new life here."
"Like you, we recognise the political challenge that implies."
"Your words today remind us of the power of the United Nations to transcend the parochial in us all."
"The United Nations has a precious power to speak for us all."
"That is why my Group wishes to see the return of the United Nations to Iraq as soon as the security situation allows."
"Credible and legitimate democratic government in Iraq is not possible without the presence of the United Nations."
"We want a political settlement in Iraq that guarantees the highest standards of civil and political rights for all Iraqis."
"The United Nations was founded by the same generation who founded this European Union – ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind’."
"Like this Union it believes that the closer we sit at the table of peace and prosperity, the slower we will be to reach for the tools of war."
"It is a sorry testament to a stubborn world that the UN still seems such an unlikely experiment in international governance."
"Winston Churchill once said that the UN is designed not to take us to heaven, but to save us from hell."
"In order to do that better the UN must reform."
"As its largest contributors, the EU and its Member States have not only the weight to insist on reform but the responsibility to do so."
"A mature Europe would find the political will to put behind it an institutional settlement at the UN that leaves power where it lay in 1945."
"A mature Europe would insist on a permanent membership that reflected the realities of the 21st century."
"It would accept that the current veto is a tool of obstruction, a privilege that can no longer be justified."
"Finally, Secretary-General, on behalf of the Liberal Group allow me to pay tribute to the members of your organisation who will not see you take this prize in their name today."
"Your staff who lost their lives with Sergio Vieira de Mello – including Fiona Watson who was known to me – died defending a vision of national renewal in Iraq that is now our duty."
"– Mr President, Secretary-General, thank you for your magnificent speech, which was very apt and brought each country face to face with its responsibilities."
"We are honoured to have you with us in this House – your presence here is highly symbolic – and in our turn we too welcome, with respect and sympathy, the family and friends of Mr Vieira de Mello and the other victims of the dreadful terrorist attack in Baghdad."
"One year ago, Secretary-General, almost to the day, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of the mission of the United Nations inspectors in Iraq."
"Many of us still wanted to believe that it was possible to avoid the war, which we sensed would cause great devastation."
"In the period that followed, it became apparent that what was happening in the United Nations reflected world public opinion as never before."
"The public took to the streets in their millions to demonstrate, while in the Security Council the majority of the Member States resisted and did battle."
"On all sides the goal was the same: to try to prevent a bloody, destabilising and irresponsible conflict."
"Rarely has the UN been able to be as faithful as it was in those days to the first words of the Charter, ‘We the Peoples of the United Nations’."
"We did not succeed, but the lesson was learnt."
"A particular idea of how the world should be organised was, admittedly, seriously flouted by a coalition of States, but since then it has, however, been spectacularly validated by the collective experience, to the point that the former gung-ho warriors are now appealing to the UN."
"This idea is firstly that war is certainly no way to resolve the world’s problems. Secondly, it is that no nation, even a hyper-power, can ignore the global challenges facing the international community."
"Finally, it is that there is more to building a world of peace than taking action against terrorist networks."
"If, to our dismay, the tragic deadlock in the Middle East should persist – 13 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Gaza by the occupying army and 10 Israelis have just lost their lives this morning in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem; this is the kind of thing that must stop at all costs – should the Iraqi occupation, the war in Chechnya and the dreadful conflicts in Africa continue; should the peace plans such as the one for Western Sahara remain unimplemented; should there continue to be humiliation and despair nourished by social and cultural divides and should violations of human rights continue to mar the world, it is probable that, in the future, the world will not be safe and no one will enjoy a peaceful life."
"It is in all our interests to be aware of this and we all have a responsibility to create a new order."
"That, Secretary-General, is how we understand the particular tribute that we are paying to you and, through you, to the countless others who embody the universal values symbolised by your organisation."
"– Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, I confess that when I was listening to you, Secretary-General, another great speech was resounding in my ears, the speech by Martin Luther King, who once declaimed in New York: ‘I have a dream’."
"And listening to you, I had a dream too, a dream that your words on immigration were echoed by all of the Members of this House and did not remain yours alone."
"I had a dream that all of the Heads of Government who say that they admire you, admired what you have just said and your lucid words on immigration."
"I had a dream that finally the peoples listening to you admired your speech and your lucid and humanist views on immigration."
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, there is no point in giving Mr Kofi Annan a standing ovation if, in our day-to-day work, in our resolutions, in our laws and in our countries, we do exactly the opposite of what he is asking us."
"And that is why, with admiration and joy – even if I admit that our group was sceptical about your being awarded this Sakharov Prize, because we wanted it to go to a man or woman from Iran or Chechnya who is fighting for their freedom – and, because you have demonstrated such clear-mindedness here, I am asking you, as a Sakharov Prize laureate, to ensure that the Turkish Government frees Leila Zana, to ensure that the Cuban Government lets this Sakharov Prize winner go and, above all, you are asked to ensure that the UN takes an initiative to enable the Jewish people, who had to emigrate from Europe because they were threatened with annihilation, to live in peace and to enable the Palestinian people, who have the right to a State, to live in peace."
"It is this idea, this strength and your lucidity that inspire me to salute you as the laureate of the Sakharov Prize."
"– Secretary-General, Presidents, our support for the choice made by the United Nations, of you and your colleagues, foremost among them Sergio Vieira de Mello, is testimony to the confidence that we have in you and the high regard in which we hold you."
"We also wanted to thank you for the work that you do at the head of this organisation and for helping to restore and reinforce its prestige."
"For all of this, we thank you."
"Of course, in choosing you we also chose your colleagues, all of those who paid with their lives to fulfil their chosen role in the service of the most just and noble of causes."
"To the families of those who are no longer with us, we wish to convey our solidarity and pay our respects, and our thoughts and good wishes also go to all of those who were injured and continue to endure physical suffering."
"You have just spoken about the problems of immigration, Secretary-General."
"You were right to do so."
"Of course, this is the utopia that will help the world to move forward and we are all aware of this."
"If you believe, however, that the problems associated with immigration will be resolved solely by ensuring that the developed countries open their borders, you are mistaken."
"Obviously this is necessary, but it is not the answer to the problem."
"I should have liked, Secretary-General – but probably this was implicit in your comments – to hear you condemn the economic consequences of globalisation and the imbalance that this creates between developed and developing countries."
"I should also have liked, Secretary-General, to hear you express the wish that developed countries would increase their aid, because the only way – or at least the main and most pressing way – to resolve the problem is firstly to give all of those who are suffering in developing countries the means to live a normal life."
"And that is why I regret the fact that the developed countries are all so reticent and overcautious in this regard."
"At one time, General De Gaulle said that if all of us had devoted 1% of GDP to this problem it would have been to a large extent resolved."
"Well, it is not too late to do so."
"And as well as applauding you, as you so richly deserve, perhaps all of those who are here, and in particular those who hold office through their parties in the governments of Western Europe, might be inspired to act on these resolutions."
"Secretary-General, every year, 17 million hectares of tropical forest are lost."
"We are destroying the planet’s biodiversity at the same rate at which the dinosaurs were wiped out."
"There are more than 110 million active mines, distributed among 70 countries."
"In ten years, two million children have been killed in wars or by landmines."
"Every day, 8 000 young people are infected with HIV."
"More than four million young people have died of AIDS."
"Thirteen million have lost their mothers or both parents, but 95% of them live in Africa, so it is not, of course, really our problem."
"Or is it?"
"When I was young, I dreamed of working for the UN and of being able to play my part in uniting the nations of the world in peace and cooperation."
"I am therefore very happy that, in the Conference of Presidents, I was able to register my group’s unanimous support for the UN, because never before have there been so many innocent and poverty-stricken children who need a helping-hand from ourselves in our cosy little corner of the rich part of the world."
"We who sit in Parliament may disagree about a lot, but we can all agree in paying tribute to you as Secretary-General of our common, worldwide organisation, the UN."
"No one can suspect the UN’s blue berets of having any remit other than peace."
"I therefore hope that the UN can be given a common and permanent military force to deploy once all peaceful means have been exhausted."
"You must not only be secretary of a Security Council whose members are in disagreement."
"You must also be general of a reformed and dynamic UN."
"In war, you must be commander-in-chief of all the generals, for, without UN permission, it should again be prohibited to go to war."
"It perhaps sounds naive, but it is still my dream that there will one day be so many naive people in the world that we shall not permit the destruction of our planet and the killing of innocent children through landmines, famine or HIV."
"We would do well to transfer a couple of hundred euros in aid from each EU cow to those whose need is greater, namely citizens who today have to place their children in something that is not a bed, following something that is not a meal and perhaps with an illness that makes life before death all too short."
"Thank you, Mr Kofi Annan, for doing more than ourselves to engage with the most important matters in the world, and thank you for your moving speech."
"– Secretary-General, on behalf of the Italian Radical Party Members, I should like, first and foremost, to echo the tributes paid to the memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello and all of those who perished with him."
"Secretary-General, we welcome your call for a Europe that is more open to immigration by men and women who have fled their countries in a bid to escape poverty and very often dictatorship."
"In welcoming them, we need to tackle the root causes that drive them to leave their countries."
"With this in mind, we very much appreciated your spelling out an idea several months ago that is both simple and revolutionary."
"‘Democracy and human rights, though distinct concepts, are closely interlinked."
"Democracy, as a human right in itself, is implied in Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but it only functions in its fullest sense when other human rights are respected.’"
"We wholeheartedly agree with you, Secretary-General: democracy is a universal value to which every human being has a right and this is the challenge that we need to take up in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere."
"Secretary-General, in this connection, before concluding, allow me to mention the issue of the appointment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"As you know, on the initiative of the Italian Presidency a European candidate has been put forward, a Member of this Parliament."
"This candidate has the support of the President of the European Commission and of key figures from all of the Union’s institutions as well as from other countries and regional groups."
"The fact that we have put forward a candidate signals Europe’s commitment to promoting and strengthening human rights, the rule of law and democracy wherever they are violated."
"Secretary-General, I would venture to hope that you will select this candidate."
". – Mr President, speaking on behalf of our committee, I too would like to express our congratulations to Mr Annan, and to all those who, in the United Nations, work for democracy, peace and freedom, and our appreciation for all those who have made such great sacrifices for them."
"I also regret the fact that domestic political circumstances prevent the laureates from Cuba, Burma and Turkey from being with us today."
"What we have to do, I believe, is to advance democracy and freedom throughout the world, for human rights on the one hand, and peace on the other, are dependent on them."
"Democracy and freedom are the pillars without which no improvement is sustainable."
"In the brief conversation that the Bureau of the Foreign Affairs Committee was able to have with you earlier, it became even clearer to us that the European Parliament and the European Union really can work together on joint projects, and that we can cooperate very closely where policy matters and budgetary resources are concerned, as well as in many other areas – be it on issues connected with the supply of water, with education in the developing world, infrastructure measures or the fight against epidemics."
"I believe that, if we succeed in this way in raising standards in the world’s less-favoured areas, we will also be creating the right conditions for peace, freedom and human rights, and it is for that reason that we need to cooperate in this area."
"The same is the case with political objectives and problem-solving, whether this be in the Middle East or in Cyprus."
"While I have to say that I listened to what you had to say about migration with a great deal of admiration, I would also like to point out at the same time that migration is an admission of failure, for we should deal with problems where people actually live; that is where we have to start."
"On behalf of Parliament I should like to thank the Council for being present here today and also the Commission, the High Representative and the laureates of the Sakharov Prize."
"I should also like to thank the relatives of the victims of the attack and the survivors for their very special presence here today."
"And most of all, Secretary-General, I thank you for being here and for the appeal to conscience which you launched in our House today."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 29 January 2004.(1)"
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 5 February 2004 has been distributed."
"I have not received any requests for changes to the agenda for Monday."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for the own-initiative report on Directive 93/104/EC on the organisation of working time, I would request that the vote take place on Wednesday rather than tomorrow, since negotiations are being held between various parliamentary groups and they asked me a moment ago if we could do this."
"If possible, therefore, we would like to be able to continue working tomorrow and vote on the report on Wednesday."
"Mr President, I support this proposal because it gives us a chance to find a solution to this very cumbersome dossier."
"As regards the oral questions on nuclear disarmament, I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group to wind up the debate with a motion for a resolution which could be put to the vote at the next sitting in Brussels."
"– Mr President, the aim of the resolution is to prepare the guidelines before the conference to revise the Treaty of Non-Proliferation."
"Traditionally, we conclude such debates with a resolution; it therefore seemed right to do so in this case too, even though the resolution will be put to the vote during the next sitting."
"– Mr President, I believe that this is one of the most important policy issues currently under consideration and discussion in the sphere of international politics."
"We frequently adopt resolutions that I do not believe are quite as significant as this, so we are very much in favour of there being a resolution to wind up this debate."
"Does anyone wish to speak against the request?"
"Mr President, my Group is against a resolution."
"(1)"
"Mr President, it has recently been brought to my attention that the Maltese Labour Party has submitted up to 1 600 petitions to the Constitutional Court in Malta, the effect of which is to disbar Maltese citizens temporarily abroad for work or study from voting in the coming European elections."
"Should this be the case, this seems to be against the letter and the spirit of both EU law and convention, in that many of these nationals are outside of their home territory for perfectly legitimate reasons."
"If this is true, this seems to be behaviour that is not consistent with the democratic process which this House would accept as the norm for a country which is shortly to become a Member State of the European Union."
"I ask you therefore to investigate whether an attempt is being made to gerrymander the electoral process in Malta and to report back to this House with your findings."
"I shall indeed enquire into the matter and report back to you, Mr Bradbourn."
"Mr President, everybody in this House is concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia, and the visit of the President of Colombia, Mr Uribe, gives this House the opportunity to make plain our concerns about that situation."
"I rise specifically, Mr President, to ask you to raise with Mr Uribe, the President-in-Office and the Commission the question of support for a proposed conference on humanitarian rights later this year."
"It has been proposed by the umbrella organisation – an alliance of 115 NGOs and civil organisations in Colombia – which is seeking to engage the civilian population in finding solutions to the 40 years of conflict."
"Mr President, I will send you the details of this proposal and ask you to consider them and to raise this matter with President Uribe when you meet him."
"I would welcome your note on the matter."
"Exceptionally, President Uribe will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy during the working day tomorrow. There will be a direct opportunity for members of that committee to bring issues to his attention."
"Mr President, I would like to protest at the leniency shown by President Musharraf of Pakistan to the television confession of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. This House has criticised Pakistan's exports of nuclear technology in the past and received condemnation from its government for doing so."
"It is extraordinary that the sale of such dangerous WMD know-how to regimes as brutal as North Korea results in a presidential pardon and the right to keep the illegally acquired payments."
"It smacks of a public scapegoating exercise in the face of embarrassing evidence of official covert support by the government."
"Secondly, I would like to send my condolences to the people of Moscow for the recent atrocious suicide bomb attack on their metro, which resulted in at least 39 deaths and 150 casualties, with everything pointing to Chechen terrorists organised by a Saudi al-Qa'ida follower."
"I ask those in this House who proclaim the glory of the Chechen freedom fighters how they account for the murder of innocent Muscovites?"
"Mr President, in a few days’ time it will be the 20th anniversary of the adoption by the European Parliament of the Draft Treaty Establishing the European Union, created and proposed by Altiero Spinelli."
"The Conference of Presidents called on the political groups to look into the possibilities for celebrating both this anniversary and the 25th anniversary of the death of Jean Monnet, one of the greatest creators of European integration."
"I would, however, like to draw your attention, Mr President, to the dissimilar nature of these two anniversaries."
"Celebrating the anniversary of the Spinelli draft means not so much paying homage to Altiero Spinelli himself, as appreciating the far-sightedness of the European Parliament that, 20 years ago, drew up and proposed the first treaty of a constitutional nature, something which it makes sense to stress today in the light of our renewed commitment to ensure that Europe is in fact finally given a Constitution."
"As you correctly observed, Mr Napolitano, your suggestion was discussed by the Conference of Presidents. It was decided that, in the last parliamentary session in May, we should observe a number of those anniversaries."
"However, with regard to the specific observation you made about the Spinelli report and the leadership of the European Parliament, I will be happy to mark that day by making a declaration on behalf of this House, in line with your preference and your suggestion to the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, referring back to what Mr Napolitano said, frankly it seems to me that your reply had very little substance to it; what we need here is, instead, much more than that."
"This is not about commemorating Altiero Spinelli, but rather about seizing the opportunity of this important and historic date, which calls for a special sitting and not for one among many celebrations."
"It would also be the opportunity to take a much bigger and more important step: let the European Parliament do as much as it did then, with Spinelli: that is to say, in order to promote the European Constitution, immediately adopt the text that resulted from the Convention, so concluding an act which, even without legal value, would have a huge political value."
"This is what I ask of you, Mr President: that the European Parliament have the courage, twenty years on, to implement the same initiatives."
"I call on you and on the chairmen of the political groups, above all those who refer to the European idea, to do this."
"I hope that they are true to their tradition."
"– Mr President, I just wanted to raise something briefly."
"A report by me on industrial associations has been put on this week’s agenda, without my knowledge, and, above all, also contrary to everything agreed by Parliament with the authorities here."
"I learned of this when someone from in London phoned me about it."
"On being asked how this could come to pass, the Parliament office responsible stated that it had been done with the groups’ agreement."
"When I asked them, I was told it was the Parliamentary services that had done it."
"This does not show this House in a very favourable light."
"I now note – with gratitude, of course – that the report’s arrival will be subject to the rapporteur’s agreement, as certain groups are aware that it is the subject of important negotiations that are still in progress."
"In practice, though, it would have been nice for this to have been done a bit more transparently and efficiently."
"I will get back to you on the detail when I have had a chance to study the matter."
"Mr President, Portuguese newspapers have recently reported appalling cases of mistreatment, abuse and even slavery, to which Portuguese workers have been subjected in various EU countries, such as France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom."
"The Portuguese newspaper this morning ran a story entitled ‘More Portuguese citizens ill-treated in the Netherlands’, which stated that the Dutch authorities had been informed of the situation."
"According to the story, however, the reports from that country are marked by unprecedented abuse perpetrated against Portuguese workers."
"There are accounts of mistreatment of workers in some companies in the Netherlands, or at the hands of gangmasters; workers are denied the most basic of rights, such as sufficient food to eat and accommodation fit for human habitation; real organised networks are said to be operating in various countries to recruit workers, which is absolutely scandalous."
"Immediate action must be taken, Mr President, to put an end to this state of affairs."
"I request, Mr President, that the Commission and the Council be notified and that immediate action be taken to eradicate the problem of these appalling attacks on workers’ rights and on human rights in general."
"I would like you to send to my office copies of the material you referred to."
"I will indeed take up the matter, as you suggest."
"Mr Martin, the report for which you are rapporteur was placed on the agenda following the normal procedures."
"However, having learned of your difficulties as regards its scheduling and in deference to you as rapporteur, it has been withdrawn from the agenda."
"– Mr President, I apologise for bringing this issue up again;"
"I have so far heard that only in the original language."
"I would just like to reiterate that there was a clear agreement with the Parliamentary services that this report would not be put on the agenda until March or April."
"I then learned from in London that it was given a slot in February."
"Only then did I say, ‘please, not yet!’"
"This is where you must not confuse cause and effect!"
"The Conference of Presidents will decide when it returns to the agenda, but it is not on the agenda now."
"That is the answer to your question."
"Mr President, last week the Commission ruled against the level of assistance being given by the Charleroi airport authorities to a certain airline."
"Not only do I sympathise with the public authorities responsible for Charleroi, I admire them for trying to take action to stimulate much-needed economic growth and jobs, in the light of declining traditional industries."
"The benefits of low-cost air travel have been felt over a much wider area than just around Charleroi."
"For example, the route from Glasgow-Prestwick to Charleroi is the only air link from the west of Scotland, a very populous area, to the capital of Europe area."
"While I recognise that the Commission sees fit to implement state aid regulations in certain ways, what about the consumers?"
"I hope that the Commission will not be over-enthusiastic and end up disadvantaging consumers, including many groups who wish – and need – to visit our headquarters and the other European institutions to learn more about how Europe actually works."
"Mr President, 25 years ago, the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded, leading to the violent infringement of human rights and, in particular, the violation of women’s rights."
"The question is, whether we are now seeing the start of a similar development in occupied Iraq."
"On 29 December, a number of rulings concerning divorces, marriages and children etc. were replaced by Sharia law in the otherwise secular state of Iraq."
"Now, I hear that the leader of the Organisation of Women's Freedom in Iraqis under violent attack from Islamic groups."
"Her name is Yamha Mohammed."
"I should very much like to ask you to protest, on behalf of Parliament, against the attacks on women’s rights that are now gathering speed in Iraq, and also to protest to the occupying forces, that is to say the alliance of so-called volunteers, against this development."
"Mr President, I too would like to raise the issue of the visit by the Colombian President, Mr Uribe, to this Parliament."
"My Group was not in favour of this invitation, and, as I understand it, neither was the ELDR Group nor the GUE/NGL Group."
"It is unfortunate that the PSE Group did not support us on this."
"There is a great danger that President Uribe will use this as a propaganda stunt to give the impression at international level that everything is fine."
"You only have to look at the UN reports on Bogota, whenever they are published, to find accounts of gross human rights violations."
"The recently introduced legislation, in particular the anti-terrorist statute which was adopted in December, gives judicial powers to the armed forces."
"This is another area of grave concern."
"This Parliament has to be very careful that it does not allow President Uribe to use this opportunity as a propaganda stunt, to give an impression that somehow the human rights situation in Colombia is improving."
"We know from the grassroots organisations on the ground that this is far from the truth."
"That false message must not be allowed to be sent out from this Parliament."
"Mr President, it is a disgrace for the European Parliament to receive the president of Colombia, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, tomorrow with honours."
"It is a disgrace for the socialists who made the proposal and for everyone who accepted it."
"Mr Uribe and his government, with the support of the USA, are responsible for the death of thousands of trade union farmers and other grass-roots fighters."
"They refuse ethnic reconciliation, they show contempt for the numerous recommendations of the UN Commission on Human Rights and they seek to suppress grass-roots dissatisfaction with military means."
"Mr Uribe's presence here shows that the European Union is moving towards getting involved in the ‘Columbia’ plan, through which the USA intervenes cruelly in this country, in an aim to achieve general control over the area."
"We condemn all external intervention and call for all governments to stand by the side of the grass-roots forces in Columbia so that the bloodshed and the activities of the paramilitary forces stop, peace is protected and human rights are respected."
"We express the undivided solidarity of the Communist Party of Greece with the Columbian people who, we are sure, will win in the end."
"– Mr President, what I have to say has to do with the safety of MEPs and the measures taken by Parliament to that end."
"On 19 January, I left the Parliament building in Brussels around 8 p.m. by the exit onto the Wiertzstraat, going towards the rue de Wavre."
"Barely 100 metres from the Parliament building, having halted at a red light, I heard an enormous bang and the passenger-side window of my car was smashed in."
"My handbag, which had been on the floor, was snatched."
"I can assure you that a lady’s handbag contains everything imaginable – cards, passport, and so on."
"Such a thing can of course happen anywhere, but I find it an extraordinarily serious matter that it should happen so close to the Parliament building."
"What I find incomprehensible is that this happens time and time again;"
"I could name more than one other Dutch lady MEP to whom it has happened."
"I came back to the Parliament building, where I had a very kind reception; about that I have no complaints."
"The security guards came when called but – you are probably not aware of this – I could not make a phone call outside Belgium."
"I could not, therefore, make a call to block my credit cards, and I think that you will understand why that was my first concern."
"The police were then called and I was able to go with them to the police station, albeit only by following them in my damaged car."
"I managed to get to the police station, where there was an officer who spoke Flemish, but not the sort that has any similarity with Dutch."
"He was a kind man, and there was nothing wrong with him, but it all got very involved."
"As I of course had nothing left on me – no money, no driving licence – I was told that I would be given an escort to , but that was not forthcoming."
"It was at around midnight that I got to my hotel, where I was dealt with more efficiently."
"I have sustained enormous loss, and I now want to ask you to ensure first of all that, in any such situation an international call can be made from the exits to the Parliament building if an MEP wishes to do so, and that assistance is available in getting to the police station, for I could have been a Dane with absolutely no knowledge of Dutch or a citizen of any other country."
"It would of course also be very useful if money were available to make it possible to take a taxi."
"Moreover, I think it is of the utmost importance that there should be better security protection for MEPs."
"As I have just said, the loss is enormous."
"I will not say how much is involved, but I expect Parliament to see to it that I am fully reimbursed."
"I did not wish to interrupt you, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, because of the personal nature of the attack you mentioned and for which, I am sure, you have the complete sympathy of Members of the House."
"I shall ask Parliament's security services to draw up a report on this for us and for the Bureau to see what general lessons we could learn as regards some of your suggestions."
"We are also in ongoing discussions with the Belgian authorities regarding security in Brussels."
"I would add that, so far, these have not resulted in a satisfactory or sufficient response as regards the requirements of this House."
"Mr President, I would like very briefly to go back over the resignation of Mr David Kay, the US official in charge of finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, possessed, it would seem, by that country’s government."
"I would also like to go back over the statements made by the British specialist, Mr Kelly, which were followed by his suspicious death."
"Finally, I would like to go back over a recent admission by President Bush, this Sunday, in an interview broadcast by NBC, stating that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime did not, in all likelihood, possess weapons of mass destruction, but that the war was nonetheless justifiable because, if they did not have weapons of mass destruction, it could perhaps have been possible for them to obtain them one day."
"I believe that we should be concerned about this because it clearly means two things."
"First of all, Mr Bush and Mr Blair lied in a cynical and serious way."
"Then, a population has been starved for ten years under a false pretext, a war was launched under a false pretext and a State has been destroyed, also under a false pretext, with the backing of a number of governments of the European Union, which is an extremely serious fact."
"Mr President, I should like to express my disgust and anger at the despicable anti-communist resolution adopted by the recent 16th conference of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which likens the barbaric, monstrous Nazi-fascism to communism and calls for a new witch-hunt to begin of the members and cadres of the communist parties who remain faithful to their high ideals."
"The Group of the European People's Party abuses and insults the memory of the millions of communists who gave their very lives to deliver mankind from the Nazi monster."
"At the same time, it shows that it supports, or even dictates the primitive anti-communism and blatant violations of human rights which prevail in the former socialist candidate countries."
"It revives a spirit of vindictiveness which only presages hardships for our peoples."
"We do not forget that the persecution of communists has always been followed by the persecution of every progressive perception."
"The peoples do not forget that Hitler also started persecutions with the communists."
"With this disgraceful and extremely dangerous resolution, the Group of the European People's Party really is seeking to stop the workers' fight against reactionary, anti-grass roots policies."
"They want to strike the pioneers of this fight, the communists who remain faithful to their ideals, because the followers are their friends and protégées."
"Mr President, a few days ago, 19 Chinese people lost their lives in Morecambe Bay in the north-west of England."
"They were cockle picking on the sands, the tide came in and they were all drowned."
"Would you agree with me that this tragedy, whilst clearly on British soil – or in British waters – is equally a European or international issue, and that we must work together to counter the international people-smuggling gangs that were exploiting these poor people who were being paid as little as one pound per day for their work?"
"Furthermore, this case once again highlights the clear need to establish an effective and efficient common European system for asylum and the same for immigration, including legal migration, as a matter of urgency."
"It is clear that what is a United Kingdom tragedy one day could easily occur in another country's territory on another day."
"Mr President, I rise in response to the outrageous comments just made by Mr Gollnisch, who implied that David Kelly, and I quote: 'died in suspect circumstances', and that Tony Blair lied."
"The recent judicial inquiry has looked at all the facts surrounding these tragic circumstances and concluded quite clearly that there were no suspect circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Kelly, as he implied, and that Mr Blair did not lie to the House of Commons on this matter."
"Whatever one's view of the Iraqi conflict – and there are different views in this House, in my country, and indeed in my party, and I have my own view on this – it is essential that we debate this matter based on the facts, not on fiction."
"The fact is that I am now the one with the microphone that works!"
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the complete disarray regarding free movement of citizens from the new Member States."
"It now seems – but it is by no means certain – that, with a mere 11 weeks to go until 1 May, 13 Member States will take advantage of the facility to put obstacles in the way of free movement."
"This has led to a spotlight on the two remaining states – Ireland and the United Kingdom – and to hysterical press reactions about being swamped by benefit tourists."
"I hold no brief for the way the British press is reacting, nor for the rather uncertain reaction of the United Kingdom Government, but I believe that the original decision to allow full free movement was and is economically, politically and morally right."
"Commission forecasts show that maybe every year there would have been one mobile worker from the East for every 1000 inhabitants in the West, if it had been shared among all states."
"There may have been some justification for special measures in border areas, but the way this panic has spread and infected most Member States is shameful."
"It treats the new Member State citizens as second class, contrary to all the promises they were given, and it displays – as on so many other issues such as Iraq, the Constitution and the budget – a depressing lack of EU solidarity."
"Could you at least raise this with the Commission and Member States in the Council to try and make the transitional periods as brief as possible?"
"Mr President, the Commission's decision concerning the commercial arrangements which Ryanair has with Charleroi airport is very misjudged."
"It flies in the face of economic reason and is a serious blow to the development of the low-cost airline industry in Europe."
"Ryanair has developed Charleroi airport from being a deserted field to catering for over two million passengers a year."
"Low-cost air travel is supported by the citizens of Europe."
"The European Commission has yet to explain clearly what it intends to do to support low-cost air travel in Europe in the future."
"The problem now is the lack of clarity regarding state aid for regional airports in Europe."
"There is now great uncertainty from the perspective of regional airports across the length and breadth of the European Union with regard to how we are going to develop the low cost-airline industry in the future."
"The Commission judgment was simply wrong and the Commission has yet to explain the future policy direction for the low-cost airline sector in Europe."
"– Mr President, both I and my colleague Mr Claeys put ourselves electronically on the speakers’ list this morning for one minute each and it now appears that we are not on it."
"I will ask the services to check on that, but I have been operating on a 'catch-the-eye' system."
"I do not have a list in front of me."
"– Mr President, I have an electronic attestation on my computer to the effect that I am registered."
"I should like to recall to colleagues that we open with a system of 'catch-the-eye'."
"I do not know what the meaning is of an 'electronic communication', but, for future reference, wave your hands and I will try to accommodate you."
"– Mr President, in preparation for the Chinese president’s visit to France, the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, has come to Brussels to ask for the lifting of the arms embargo on China."
"The fact is that France is dreaming about concluding lucrative contracts with Beijing, which will push up its arms industry’s turnover, and so the Chinese president received an imperial welcome in France."
"Nothing was said about human rights;"
"Tibet is being oppressed, but it would appear that the French president does not even know where it is."
"When you have the opportunity to sell some of your friend Monsieur Dassault’s Mirage jet fighters, you prefer not to think about a few boring old monks."
"Jacques Chirac, who can wax so lyrical about tolerance in his own country, evidently did not have the time to read the reports of the various human rights organisations, which, year in and year out, detail the Chinese offences: censorship, arbitrary arrests, overcrowded prisons, re-education camps and the absence of free expression of opinion."
"Jacques Chirac even managed to describe the forthcoming referendum in Taiwan as an act of aggression against China."
"That the European Union has no option but to do business with China is something we have to be able to accept, but supplying weapons is a completely different matter."
"We are therefore in full agreement with Mr Watson’s statement that this arms embargo is one of the last means available to the European Union, whereby it can force the Communist dictatorship in China to respect human rights."
"The next item is the report (A5-0040/2004) by Giorgos Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the role and methods of credit rating agencies (2003/2081(INI))."
". Mr President, the report I have the honour of presenting is an own-initiative report on credit rating agencies, which are business organisations of good standing in the markets."
"However, their reputation has been shaken somewhat by the recent spate of financial scandals, starting with Enron and ending with Parmalat."
"The Parmalat fraud is especially relevant as it concerns bondholders: precisely the section of the market that rating agencies are supposed to protect."
"Until a few days before the crash of these companies, they were unable to do anything about protecting the public."
"These failures have prompted debates in the United States, investigations in the US Congress, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the International Organization of Securities Commission and other international fora."
"There is a specific European angle on this matter."
"Rating agencies that are one hundred years old in the United States are relative newcomers in Europe."
"In some cases they have given indications of not understanding European business mentality."
"They have created friction, especially in Germany."
"The other point of special European interest is the inevitable remark that whatever the nature of the regulation of the agencies – however mild and indirect – it has its seat exclusively in the United States, in the form of the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"The fact that nothing similar exists in Europe makes for an unbalanced transatlantic relationship which might become troublesome if it is not redressed in time."
"These considerations prompted the original proposal of the report in favour of the formation of a European registration authority to be considered by the Commission, an authority to which agencies would report on their activities and with which they could establish a regulatory dialogue, a dialogue of equals based on the European Security Ratings Committee, on topics of mutual interest – excluding, of course, any intervention in the substance of the opinions issued by the agencies."
"It is interesting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently expressed interest in making contact with the CSR on this matter."
"The majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs found this proposal too and recommended re-examining the whole area of operations of rating agencies without including in their recommendation anything as specific as the creation of a European registration authority."
"With all due respect for the majority opinion of my colleagues, I beg to differ for two reasons."
"Firstly, because a regulatory authority operates in the United States and, secondly, because – as I have already said – the lack of a corresponding authority in Europe creates a potentially harmful imbalance."
"I have therefore asked my political group to help me out by resubmitting the proposal for a European registration agency in the form of an amendment, and I urge all colleagues who originally may have differed on this point to think again."
"This is not a party political issue, but it is certainly a political issue because it involves the interests of Europe as a whole."
"The alternative is that the agencies will eventually – such is the strength of feeling in favour of some regulation of their activities – be forced to report to 15 or 25 national financial authorities in Europe, something the agencies themselves must view with horror."
"Rating agencies must continue to do good work."
"We have proposed no heavy-handed regulation, but, without a European registration agency, we will be failing to attain what is obviously our main objective."
"While thanking my colleagues for supporting various other useful proposals, I urge them to think again about this."
". Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the European Parliament's decision to draw up a report on the role and methods of rating agencies."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative, which is timely."
"As you all know, the role of rating agencies is increasing nowadays."
"In the past, credit ratings focused mainly on sovereign debt."
"However, in the last decade, the role of credit ratings has become ever more crucial, with the growth of corporate bond issuances and the inclusion of references to credit ratings in several pieces of financial legislation, including banking legislation."
"Besides, as everybody knows, recent major scandals have raised questions on the role of rating agencies in general: we cannot forget the Enron case in 2001, or the recent Parmalat case, among others."
"Therefore, it is clear that it is now time to take action, as Mr Katiforis rightly pointed out."
"There are at least four issues to be resolved regarding credit rating agencies."
"First, the legal treatment of the question of access by rating agencies to inside information from issuers is currently unclear in Europe."
"There is no harmonised European legislation, nor even any regulation at national level."
"If rating agencies are to have access to inside information from issuers, we should ensure that the same information is available to all rating agencies."
"I think Mr Katiforis’ report reflects this."
"Another solution would be to prohibit rating agencies from access to inside information from issuers, as is done in the case of financial analysts."
"The second issue regarding credit rating agencies in the context of Enron and Parmalat concerns the level of skill of agency staff, as well as the transparency of their methodology."
"It would be sensible to think about measures to tackle this issue and we clearly agree with Mr Katiforis on this."
"With this is mind, a directive adopted by the Commission last December, implementing the Market Abuse Directive as regards fair presentation of investment recommendations, could be a good starting point."
"The third issue commonly raised is the lack of competition among credit rating agencies."
"In practice, the worldwide industry is nearly an oligopoly."
"We therefore welcome Mr Katiforis' call to promote more competition in Europe."
"The establishment of objective criteria for entrance or development of other players in the industry might help."
"The fourth and last issue, probably the most debated, regards conflicts of interest for credit rating agencies and these take two different forms."
"On the one hand, there is a suspicion that the provision of advisory services by rating agencies to companies they rate might influence the outcome of the rating process."
"Therefore, such advisory services should be disclosed along with the rating."
"Once again, the directive adopted by the Commission last December, implementing the Market Abuse Directive as regards disclosure of conflicts of interest, could be a good starting point to tackle this question."
"The second conflict of interest, and the most controversial, relates to the remuneration of rating agencies by the companies they rate."
"If the rating agency is paid by an issuer, rather than by subscribers, it casts doubts regarding the possibility of 'downgrade rigidity' when ratings are updated."
"This question is not new but now needs to be resolved."
"We have to take action fast on these four issues."
"The European Commission committed itself to that at the Oviedo European Council in April 2002."
"We have to respect our commitment before new scandals occur."
"The European Commission will thus be able to take a position on the subject by the summer or autumn of 2004 at the latest."
"Among other contributions, Mr Katiforis’ report will be an important element to guide us."
"In conclusion, the question remains of what the United States is going to do on this matter."
"We must be realistic."
"The top two worldwide rating agencies are American."
"It would be reasonable to take this into account, as Mr Katiforis rightly stressed."
"For the moment, however, the American Securities and Exchange Commission is silent on the subject, despite calls for changes from Congress."
"If the United States wants to achieve convergence with us before we adopt a position, we would appreciate having a clear view from its side on this crucial topic quickly."
"We will keep you informed in due course."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Katiforis, whom, for a start, I warmly thank for the report on the future assessment of rating agencies."
"What is this actually about?"
"It is a fact that rating agencies have, in the capital market, a very great deal of power and influence over enterprises."
"Upgrading or – in particular – downgrading is significant for an enterprise, in that it makes for major problems with the raising of capital, financial problems, and that does of course have indirect effects on jobs."
"Rating agencies, though, also assess countries; in Germany, for example, they assess the Federal states."
"It follows that the upgrading and downgrading of German federal states has effects on the taxpayer."
"I am not making this point by way of criticism, but only as an observation."
"There are three rating agencies in the market; even though I am a defender of competition and would very much welcome it if they were to be joined by more, I think that an administrative, public solution would be the wrong one."
"If anything, the creation of any more rating agencies, or at any rate, of a European one, should be in response to the market, but all attempts to do so to date have been unsuccessful."
"If we take into account the power that the rating agencies have, and our tendency, in legislating on financial markets, towards ever more regulation and supervision, then we have to give some thought to how we are to handle them in future."
"It is for this reason that I regard Mr Katiforis’ report as very important, in that it is the first in Europe to give attention to this topic."
"It is also important that Europe should do so."
"I would describe all three of the existing rating agencies as being predominantly Anglo-Saxon."
"Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with that; but there are, after all, different financial structures within the European Union and around the world, with different rules, and not every rule that works on one side of the Atlantic must likewise be applicableon the other."
"That is why I see it as highly significant that we should make the attempt at the European level."
"In so doing, we should not give so much attention to what the Americans are doing in this field, for – after all – rating agencies also want to do business in this part of the world."
"All this we have to consider in the context of Basel II, in which rating – whether internal or external – will increasingly apply in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It will become normal, and the quintessential difference between external and internal rating will be that internal rating will, in the Member States, be subject to financial supervision, whereas external rating will not."
"What is at issue is whether we can carry on in future with only internal rating being supervised, while external rating is not."
"My main reason for raising this point is that I am told, by people in industry and in the financial sector, that businesses themselves find it very difficult to get the relevant information about their own rating, so one can scarcely speak in terms of a normal customer relationship between enterprises and rating firms."
"This makes it important that we should now demand that the Commission should analyse this issue, do some work on it, say precisely how things currently stand, and make proposals."
"That is why I very largely share Mr Katiforis’ concerns."
"The outcome should, however, be left open; we should not already be calling for registration and supervision, which can be left to the end of the process."
"We can, though, aim to get the rating agencies to give an undertaking, which would include a commitment to transparency, and which the Commission should take as a basis for its work."
"This process could well involve the rating agencies making their own proposals."
"I regard it as a matter of urgency – as does the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that we should get this process underway now, that we should monitor it with a critical eye, and that the Commission should submit its proposals in the middle of next year."
"Mr President, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, Mr Katiforis, well done on this initiative, well done on the content of this report."
"I believe that it comes at an important time."
"Whenever people try to take on board that ‘macro’ thinking of ours which we defend point by point, in particular in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, one thing that occasionally strikes them is the gap that sometimes exists – and which I am grateful for your having to some extent highlighted, Commissioner – between, on the one hand, the social model we claim to embody and, on the other hand, the standards we employ and the specific work we are involved in."
"If we are to talk about rating agencies and if we are to be delighted with our rapporteur’s initiative, it is because the market is blind and because, in this blindness, rating agencies have obtained, or are obtaining, an altogether essential decision-making power that will have far-reaching consequences for the future of enterprises and, therefore, of jobs."
"In view of this, I would like to make three remarks."
"The first is that what we say here cannot be seen as separate from the global debate on corporate governance."
"What type of corporate governance do we want for our social model in Europe?"
"What division of roles between capital and labour do we want?"
"What role should redistribution have?"
"These are the questions that we should answer by way of the solutions that we envisage for the operation of these agencies in particular, but not only for these agencies."
"I remember the debates that we had on the issue of accounting standards, and we are seeing the wayward effects of the so-called autonomy of the IASB."
"I do not want the same thing to happen to us where rating agencies are concerned."
"My second remark is that if, in Europe, we want the improvement in the operation of rating agencies to contribute to protecting our social model, then we cannot leave aside the issue of corporate social responsibility."
"In this area too, agencies are now coming into being."
"They are European initiatives."
"I am thinking, in particular, of Mrs Nicole Notat’s agency in France, Vigeo."
"These are complementary developments that we should reflect upon."
"Finally, my third remark, Commissioner, is an expression of regret at not having heard your opinion on the amendment, proposed by our rapporteur and to be fully supported both by myself and my group, in favour of establishing European registering and regulatory agencies."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this issue."
"It is topical and Mr Katiforis has brought great insight into this issue."
"I am particularly grateful that he has taken on a number of the concerns I expressed in my amendments."
"I hope that a deal may be reached between the PPE-DE Group and the rapporteur."
"That has not proved possible – so far – but I am sure there is a great deal in his report that we very much support."
"In a slightly shock reversal of the normal roles within the PPE-DE Group, I found that the rest of my Group were more cautious about the idea of further regulation than I was: usually I am the one in my Group arguing for a more deregulatory approach."
"What is very important – and it was stated clearly by Mr Radwan, the shadow rapporteur – is that yes, this is an important issue; yes, questions need to be answered about how ratings agencies work and yes, questions need to be asked about whether we should have a registration scheme for ratings agencies."
"The conclusion the Group came to was that we should not prejudge the outcome of this process."
"It is important that Members of Parliament and committees look carefully at the issues raised by Mr Katiforis in his report, but we do not want to prejudge the outcome and say at this point that yes, we should have a European registration authority."
"We in this Group are wary of the cost of regulation."
"We are concerned about what a significant step it would be to bring rating agencies within a regulatory framework or a registration scheme, and we must be cautious in our response to recent financial scandals."
"There is a tendency among some financial commentators to assume that we must have further regulation following Parmalat, and the organisations that are most squarely in the frame for further regulation and registration are rating agencies."
"We should look objectively and calmly at what happened at Parmalat and see what response is necessary so as to avoid any hasty or knee-jerk reactions, because it is difficult to see how changing the scheme or regulation for rating agencies could have prevented the Parmalat scandal."
"There will always be people who are prepared to break the law, as they were at Parmalat, and no matter how wide-ranging and effective the scheme of regulation, whether it be for hedge funds or rating agencies or whatever else, we are not going to prevent that kind of criminal conduct."
"We can try and make it happen less often, but it is impossible to prevent."
"Questions have to be asked about rating agencies and how they function, but it is premature to reach the conclusion that further regulation or a registration scheme are necessarily needed at this stage."
"– Mr President, I can tell Mrs Villiers that we should not, at any rate, be saying that we do not know what we are asking for or what we want."
"It is unfortunate that the work done by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has left us with little of the original draft report – little, that is, that would demand greater transparency of the rating agencies, and require that they be monitored more closely."
"Now, in the aftermath of global financial scandals ranging from WorldCom to Parmalat is surely the time for rating agencies to be registered and their practices monitored."
"In view of Basel II’s recognition of external rating, and of the consequences resulting from it, the message we are giving now to the Commission is not a matter for indifference."
"This report takes a tolerant view of an oligopoly that is almost impossible to monitor, one that is quite contrary to all the practices of the internal market."
"Of the hundred largest enterprises in the European Union, 80 are monitored by only three agencies, which should, therefore, be able to do a better job of rating them."
"The information used to produce an assessment is also important when deciding where to invest."
"This is where we cannot lag behind current developments in the USA, where, only recently, serious problems resulted in the existing system of rating agency supervision, which is in the hands of the Securities and Exchange Commission, being substantially tightened up."
"I am sorry to have to tell Mr Katiforis that the signal this own-initiative report sends to the Commission is too moderate and gives us too little cause to hope that we will end up with a trustworthy instrument."
"I will nonetheless conclude by endorsing his appeal that, in view of the many current uncertainties, we should explore every avenue whereby a European Registration Authority may be established."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Katiforis, ladies and gentlemen, this report and this issue are of particular significance in view of the many questions that are being raised."
"Previous speakers have already shown you how the rating agencies have gained twofold significance – on the one hand as a result of notorious scandals, and on the other as a result of the consumer credit directive or the development of Basel II."
"Let us be frank, and admit that every customer of a bank, and certainly anyone taking out a loan, is the subject of some form of rating process."
"Above all, rating agencies assess companies and countries."
"These evaluations lead to debates on the level of interest rates, the amount of equity capital and the stock exchange prices; they also have an effect on customers’ confidence in the business and country in question."
"It also, of course, follows that we have to bear in mind that the whole philosophy behind rating agencies is largely of Anglo-Saxon origin and that there are three large firms in this field that carry out ratings – major and significant ones – in Europe too."
"That being so, we also have to consider the fact that all these rating agencies possess a quality mark – an American one awarded by theSecurities and Exchange Commission."
"If, then, we are to talk in terms of more competition, we need not only European agencies, but also a quality mark, for some kind of quality mark has the natural effect of building confidence and enhancing the agency’s value in the market."
"We therefore want to put the case for Europe’s rating agencies to be promoted and for them to respond specifically to the characteristics and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We want to advocate the introduction of a European quality mark, or, best of all, a global one, to accompany Basel II, and we want a debate on internal and external rating."
"We favour freedom of opinion and the agencies’ independence, and we want greater transparency."
"That is why I regard it as intolerable that there should be no licensing procedure whatever for rating agencies."
"It may be that starting with financial market supervision, and with equal treatment for internal and external ratings so that agencies can be registered, that is to say, authorised, is a good approach that we should adopt, instead of creating new authorities."
"Mr President, I too wish to offer my praise for this report."
"It is an excellent initiative and I, like most Members of this House who have spoken, hope that we will be able, in the course of proceedings, specifically in plenary, to make Mr Katiforis’s original philosophy a reality."
"As Mr Katiforis stated, the crux of the issue at stake today, regarding this own-initiative report, is whether or not the activities of the rating agencies should be regulated and if so, whether such regulation should take place at national or European level."
"As the rapporteur suggested in his explanatory statement, this is clearly a political decision, and this debate clearly bears out this view."
"However, the rapporteur was initially unquestionably in favour of regulation, and regulation at European level, even though voices closely associated with the sector have been raised against such a move."
"Representatives of the sector appreciate that their activities form part of the sphere of economic information and that what is at stake, therefore, is to guarantee complete freedom for such economic information."
"The need for information is obviously not incompatible with the needs and interests of regulation and while it has to be admitted that rating agencies have, by and large, performed respectably under the current system, it is also clear that we face new problems today – and there have been some spectacular examples of these, as Members who spoke before me have already mentioned – that require new solutions and probably a new system."
"Moreover, there is no doubt that the rapporteur’s options are in line with the legislative approach adopted by the EU within the framework of financial services."
"To my mind, it is therefore in the public interest to establish bodies to regulate credit rating, especially because, as we all know, the outcome of this activity already has a decisive impact on the legitimacy and eligibility of certain financial assets for certain types of application used by the general public."
"Consequently, I feel that the rapporteur’s first initiative, which was not accepted in its entirety by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must be endorsed and supported by plenary. It is extremely bold, yet completely justified."
". Mr President, it was a very interesting discussion and it is obvious that this is a hot political and economic issue."
"Members discussed many questions."
"I would particularly like to underline the discussion on regulation: whether this regulation concerns only transparency and criteria of transparency or whether it should be more binding."
"Then there is the interesting issue of an independent authority, what kind of entity that would be and whether we should agree to establish it at European level."
"Another major issue is the registration of these companies and whether they have to be registered at European or at national level."
"The Commission agrees with many of the points the Katiforis report has made, but it will present its final position at the end of spring or at the latest in autumn."
"I would like to thank Mr Katiforis again for his very interesting contribution."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0026/2004) by Mr Cercas, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the organisation of working time (revision of Directive 93/104/EEC) (2003/2165(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the main aim of my report is to examine two articles of Council Directive 93/104/EC on certain aspects of the organisation of working time."
"This important directive was approved ten years ago in order to regulate certain factors which are essential to the health and safety of salaried workers, such as daily rest periods and holidays."
"The directive also indicates the maximum weekly working time of 48 hours, although it allows it to be calculated as an average over a reference period of four months."
"The approval of this important directive – which is one of the most important in Community social legislation – was not a straightforward process."
"The resistance of the United Kingdom was only overcome by the Court of Justice and, for ten years, we had to have two temporary exceptions with regard to the reference period for calculation of the 48 weekly hours, and with regard to the application of the 48 hours weekly working time in those countries that want to implement this exception if the workers wish, provided that this wish is expressed freely and reliably: this is what is known as individual opting-out."
"The Commission and the Council should have re-examined these temporary exceptions before 26 November last year."
"Regrettably, however, the Commission did not communicate its analyses or proposals by that date."
"Up until 30 December 2003 it did not present us with any Communication nor open up a consultation period, and furthermore its text lacks specific proposals on the trickiest issues."
"What the Commission has done – and we should thank it – has been to commission a study by the University of Cambridge – carried out by Barnard, Deakin and Hobbs – on the way opting-out has been used in the country which approved it, in other words, the United Kingdom."
"This report provides us with in-depth knowledge of the negative consequences of its widespread use and abuse in a labour market in which it has been applied in a generalised manner."
"My report refers exclusively to the re-examination of these two exceptions in order to respond not with waffle, but with clarity, to the question the Directive obliges us to ask: 10 years after its adoption, does it make sense to maintain the extension of the reference periods?"
"Does it make sense to maintain the principle that it is possible not to apply the maximum 48 hours by means of individual opting out?"
"I say in my report that both questions must be answered in light of the principles which governed the adoption of the Directive: the health and safety of workers."
"These must be accompanied by a third: flexibility, as indicated by the Commission in its communication."
"We must ensure that the professional and family lives of Europeans are reconciled."
"My proposals are also clear."
"According to our objective information, there is no reason to abrogate the extension of the reference periods which have proven to be useful and have not, at least for the moment, had serious consequences for the health and safety of workers, but on the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence that opting-out seriously jeopardises minimum health and safety rights, and seriously jeopardises the reconciliation of family and professional life."
"The debate and the vote within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been very tough."
"I hope that tomorrow we can continue working and bringing positions closer together."
"I personally have maintained an open attitude to the element of flexibility, also with regard to the problem of the duty hours of doctors which has been introduced into this debate."
"I have been flexible, just as the Directive is flexible."
"Now, I have always stated, and I will do so until the end, that individual opting-out sets extremely dangerous precedents: minimum rights, Mr President, are inalienable."
"If today workers are being obliged or allowed to surrender basic rights, such as maximum hours, tomorrow, on the basis of the same argument, they could be allowed to surrender other essential elements of their health and safety, to work in environments in which they suffer noise, dust, the removal of protective barriers at work sites, to surrender maternity rights and many other things."
"And all in the name of individual freedom, which disappears when it is applied."
"It is a horrendous precedent."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that our Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 137 of the Treaty oblige us to resist the wishes of those who do not want European rules. Opting-out is not a flexible rule: it is the absence of rules."
"By allowing basic minimum rights legislation not to be applied to someone, we would be advocating the absence of rules."
"I hope that all Members of this House will give this full consideration."
"We cannot offer victory to people who do not want the social Europe to be built, to those allergic to minimum rules, which workers on our continent have enjoyed for more than a century."
". Mr President, I must thank Mr Cercas for his excellent report in connection with the revision of a directive which is one of the foundation stones of Community labour law."
"As we have heard, the main objective of this directive, which is also both its political framework and its legal basis, is to protect workers from the harmful effects on their health and safety from working excessively long hours, inadequate rest or irregular working hours."
"The directive is in fact a framework of minimum health and safety requirements as regards daily and weekly rest, the maximum working week, annual paid leave and the length of night shifts."
"Of course, we must not overlook the fact that, although the legal framework is the health and safety of workers, it also relates directly to the productivity of enterprises."
"Enterprises which have workers without these minimum acceptable limits clearly cannot achieve the required productivity."
"The Commission, as required due to the expiry of the ten-year period from publication of the directive, presented its report on 30 December and announced the revision of the working time directive."
"The Commission, taking account of the manner in which this directive was implemented in the 15 Member States, is obliged to evaluate two provisions in this directive."
"First, the derogations regarding reference periods and how the maximum working week is calculated."
"Mr Cercas questioned if we need to debate this matter, which has not created any particular problems."
"However, we have numerous branches which have problems and which would be interested in a different reference period and this has translated into proposals and discussions by both employers and employees."
"Secondly, the possibility of individual exceptions from the maximum working time, the famous 'opting out'."
"Of course, these two issues cannot be addressed without taking account of recent developments in the case law of the European Court of Justice, which qualifies the time which a doctor is at home on call as working time, insofar as he is called to the health centre during the period he is at home."
"Consequently, the Commission communication expressly concerns itself with the results of these judicial cases."
"We cannot look at the two provisions which need to be revised without taking account of the ruling of the courts."
"This is an extremely complicated issue which, as you too emphasise in your report, requires detailed evaluation of any repercussions of this change of legislation."
"That is why the Commission has started a broad consultation procedure."
"At the same time, we are asking for the opinion of the social partners within a special framework of procedures, as laid down in the Treaty, and we are already in the first stage of consultations in accordance with Article 138 of the Treaty."
"I must stress here that, according to the Treaty, the role of the social partners is very different, it is independent, and the framework within which the Commission is starting the debate cannot but be broad and the first approach cannot result in directions set by the Commission, because the social partners themselves must consult in the first and second stages, so that we have their positions."
"That is why I would say, as you will have observed, that this first communication has a fairly general framework."
"Nonetheless, there are various points on which I think we are fairly clear and which I support."
"The first is that we cannot but have a careful analysis and evaluation of the repercussions and consequences of any change, first, on workers, because on questions of health and safety there can be no compromises, and secondly, on the functioning of enterprises."
"Secondly, we need to address the matter in all its aspects."
"It is, as we said, a fundamental directive for labour law and we must categorically avoid any exclusively sectoral approach."
"Of course, this does not mean that we must not take account of various important problems, such as in the field of health which, following the rulings by the Court, could be extended to other branches with similar problems."
"The third point is the correlation between working time and equal opportunities."
"This is an innate link which exists in the directive which, essentially, helps encourage the Member States to take measures which improve compatibility between working and family life."
"The fourth point concerns 'opting out'."
"There are various types of approach."
"I would say there are two extremes, the first being that we have no facility to opt out of the maximum working time, in other words we completely abolish 'opting out', and the second being that we generalise 'opting out'. This generalisation would, essentially, leave employers and employees the facility to decide on working times and the entire employment framework."
"Both extreme views create significant problems: the first takes no account of the special characteristics of branches, of a large number of branches and, more importantly, of the special characteristics which might arise from rulings such as that by the Court, with very serious consequences in the specific case of health systems."
"If there are also rulings of this type in other branches in the future, then other branches will have similar problems."
"The second extreme position, which concerns overall acceptance of 'opting out' as a way of operating the job market, essentially abolishes all the fundamental frameworks of the European Union based on workers' rights which essentially take account of health and safety and which link productivity with the worker as a person."
"I would say from the outset that I am opposed to both these extreme approaches."
"Of course, we must accept that the institutional framework which the directive in question had for 'opting out' allowed for it to be abused."
"That is also why there are countries in which we have systematic abuse of 'opting out' in all branches, in all categories of enterprise, with very serious problems for the workers."
"I therefore think that we should see and resolve these basic outstanding issues, taking account, on the one hand, of the need to use 'opting out' and, on the other hand, of the existence of new criteria and binding positions on the Member States, so that there is control of their use and not their abuse."
"Because this directive is clearly of very great importance and affects the job market and the economy and has a direct impact on the lives of millions of workers in Europe and, at the same time, on enterprises and the economy of Europe, we need real, substantial consultation with all the agencies involved and, of course, as we said, with the social partners."
"Our objective is for this procedure to bring us to a better legislative framework which takes account of the real impact on the job market and best serves the basic objective of the directive, which is to protect the health and safety of workers."
"I think that Parliament has the first word in this consultation process."
"Your report is extremely topical and material."
"I would like to assure you that it is the basis for preparations and, of course, is only the Commission's first debate and approach with Parliament."
"Over all the coming months we shall have the opportunity for constant debate and exchanges of opinion, so that we take account of your particular positions."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner and thanking her for her wise, practical and helpful comments today and also for the report by the Commission, which was extremely well balanced."
"I mean no disrespect to the rapporteur, and I hope he will forgive me for saying that I cannot make the same comments about his own report."
"As he knows, together with the ELDR Group, we nearly managed to defeat it in committee, but virtually none of our amendments were accepted."
"Yet they so nearly won through and, had we succeeded, we would not have had to trouble the House on this occasion."
"Needless to say, we are retabling those amendments and we hope that the full House will do justice to them in the vote on Wednesday."
"The sad thing about the report was that essentially it stated in black and white that there should be no opt-out at all under any circumstances and that the UK should be taken to court for alleged abuses, as if to say: my mind is made up, do not confuse me with the facts."
"I would like to share some facts with the House this evening."
"Opting out from the working time directive is voluntary: nobody can legally be forced to sign an opt-out and it is important to give people the flexibility to work longer hours and earn the overtime if they wish."
"Research in the UK has indicated that 2.5 million people work longer than the maximum hours stated in the directive, but two thirds of them get paid for the extra hours so would lose out if the opt-out were removed. It is true that some workers would like to work fewer hours, but not if the cut in hours means a drop in pay."
"More than seven out of ten of those working longer hours said they would not want fewer hours if it meant less pay."
"There is that health and safety have been compromised in any of these circumstances."
"I would now just like to talk briefly about the report by Barnard, Deakin and Hobbs, which the rapporteur referred to."
"He stated that, according to its conclusions, there have been abuses on a massive scale."
"I have to say that the conclusions say nothing of the kind."
"It was interesting that, when the Commission report itself came out, there was an article in the on Tuesday, 6 January, co-authored by Catherine Barnard and Simon Deakin, professing surprise at the way their report had been misinterpreted."
"I would just like to quote three short paragraphs. 'It is true that we did uncover evidence of some abuses of the opt-out system."
"Sometimes, the opt-out was presented as a standard contract term to new staff, which they would have to take positive steps to avoid."
"But this was unusual."
"What was striking was that, for every employee who felt under pressure to opt out, we found others who wanted the right to choose what hours they worked and what salary, status and job satisfaction they gained as a result (...)."
"We quickly discovered a gap between the rhetoric around reducing working hours and the reality of working life for many people."
"In one example given to us, workers in the tobacco industry could lose hundreds of pounds a week in overtime pay if they were limited to working 48 hours.'"
"They state in the final paragraph that 'a complete ban on long hours would be unfeasible in many companies and industries or would be simply disregarded.'"
"Those are the facts, not as presented by the rapporteur."
"Therefore the conclusion has to be that the opt-out must stay and abuses, if any, must go."
"I would hope that Members on all sides of the House could support that."
"Finally, I would just mention the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments."
"They are the important issues we should be addressing and our amendments try to focus on those issues, because we have to try to resolve the very clear problems that the Court of Justice has raised."
"In conclusion, I know that on the record in September UK Labour MEPs said that they voted unanimously against retaining the opt-out, but it is never too late to repent."
"I still cherish the hope that on Wednesday they will vote with us in the interests both of employment and employees."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work on the organisation of working time."
"As the Commissioner said, this is an issue which touches every worker and family within the European Union."
"However, although I clearly understand that individual Commissioners do not always get what they want when they want it, I am very disappointed with the way the issue of working time has been handled by the Commission as a whole."
"It had ten years to prepare and produce proposals on the operation of derogations on the opt-out and annualisation; the review and communication were clearly required by November 2003 and yet, incredibly, the Commission still managed to miss the deadline."
"When the communication came, it was, quite frankly, hardly worth the paper it was printed on."
"It is a weak document and gives no clear signal on the best direction for action."
"It should not, in my opinion, be allowed to stand as a proper instrument for the opening of the first phase of consultation between the social partners under the procedure included in Article 138."
"I hope the social partners will make that clear."
"Also, by the time the Commission got around to producing the communication, it was being bombarded with notifications from Member States that they would begin to use the opt-out in their health-care sectors in response to the SIMAP and Jaeger rulings."
"No doubt some Member States were being opportunistic in this respect, but the Commission had had three years to react to SIMAP; its inaction could therefore lead to the neutering of a central piece of EU health and safety law."
"In our view, a blanket spread in the use of the opt-out is not the answer to SIMAP and Jaeger."
"We want speedy and specific action from the Commission in response to those judgments and then time to sensibly revise other provisions in the original directive."
"As to how we solve those difficulties, we could look to social partner agreements or re-rostering arrangements that have been put in place in certain parts of the EU to deal with the implications of those cases."
"Or we could look at the type of definition we adopted to cover the case of relief drivers and overnight ferry tripsin dealing with working time for drivers."
"As well as working time and rest time the notion of periods of availability was included there."
"More generally, people like Mr Bushill-Matthews are constantly telling me that the opt-out is essential to give companies the flexibility they need to operate."
"It is strange then, in my view, that until recently only one Member State used this opt-out: the others were managing just fine and would still be managing in their health-care sectors if not for the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments."
"The truth is that the directive is flexible."
"More relaxed arrangements apply to a whole range of occupations and activities and the reference periods are generous."
"I for one would also be quite happy to look at whether annualisation of working time could be made a more realistic option in all Member States."
"Overall, the Socialist Group takes the view that an opt-out from a health and safety directive is a dangerous nonsense."
"The possibility was created for purely political reasons ten years ago and it was a bad idea from the start."
"A general opt-out is bad for the welfare of workers, bad for a proper work-life balance, damaging to efforts to encourage women to return to the labour market and, as the statistics show, not at all helpful in the drive to boost productivity."
"It is not the direction a Union committed to transforming itself into the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world should even think of taking."
"So I, for one, will not repent and I will certainly not join Mr Bushill-Matthews on Wednesday."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission brought forward the consultation document."
"It would have been useful, however, to have brought it forward before Mr Cercas drew up the report, but I am very pleased that we were able to table oral amendments."
"Nevertheless this is not the ideal way of working and I would like to register that point."
"I tabled a number of amendments, a lot of them with the PPE-DE Group, and some of my own."
"The main point – and I am very pleased the Commissioner touched on this – is that the individual opt-out should be kept, but that it should be truly voluntary and measures should be taken to tackle any abuse."
"But as Mr Bushill-Matthews said, that abuse is not as widespread in the UK as the rapporteur leads us to believe."
"Indeed, as Mr Bushill-Matthews and the rapporteur have repeatedly said, the authors of the research – Barnard, Deakin and Hobbs – stated that the abuse was widespread."
"Those people have distanced themselves from what you have written in your report and indeed would distance themselves from your statement today."
"To answer Mr Hughes' point, one of the reasons for maintaining the opt-out is that in the UK we do not have collective agreements."
"That is one of the main reasons we use the opt-out."
"Other Member States use derogations because they have collective agreements."
"Decisions can be made between both sides of industry: trade unions and employers will get together and decide what they want to do on the Working Time Directive."
"But because we do not have that – at least not to any great extent – we need the flexibility for our businesses to be able to cope."
"Wages are not a competence of the EU, nor should they be."
"We should not be discussing pay."
"But workers in the UK are on low wages, even though we have a national minimum wage."
"They quite often add to their take-home pay by doing overtime."
"If we get rid of the opt-out, there will be many cases of workers not being able to do overtime and therefore not getting a reasonable pay level."
"We are not the only country that uses it either: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg are all either using it or going to use it in the health or catering industries."
"Another problem is the length of reference period."
"Tourism and agriculture have a particular problem because of different working patterns and because of the times of year that they work."
"The Commission must also look at the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments."
"It is very important that we do that on health and come forward with proposals."
"I hope enough MEPs will join us tomorrow when we vote, in particular those Labour MEPs who voted against us in committee and against the UK Labour Government."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as we know, this 1993 directive, which lays down minimum conditions governing the organisation of working time, with a view to ensuring a high level of health and safety for workers, should have been transposed into national law by 1996, establishing the possibility of limited derogation."
"The truth of the matter is that various Member States have used and abused these derogations and have not complied with the provisions therein, especially the upper limit of working time in sectors such as health, and the hotel and catering industries."
"Once again, now that the seven-year deadline has elapsed, the Commission has regrettably given no clear signal as to how the problems that have come to light are to be solved."
"Hence my endorsement of most of the proposals contained in the Cercas report, in particular the provision of an amended directive resolving existing problems and ensuring a higher level of health and safety protection for workers. I also welcome the comparison study on the repercussions of long working hours on the family and on health, and the effect on both sexes."
"The Court of Justice has ruled in a number of cases, and has included time spent on call as working time, thereby confirming the fundamental principle that time not entirely available to workers due to work commitments must be regarded as working time."
"I congratulate Mr Cercas on the work he has carried out and, as he states in his report, derogations in the form of individual opt-out clauses must be scrapped and we must work towards reducing the pressures and eliminating the abuses that undermine family life."
"My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left, has tabled proposals that would enable us to extend these rights a little further."
"We have called for a revision of the directive, initially reducing the maximum working week from 48 to 42 hours; and for a gradual reduction in the working week to 36 hours, over the course of the next seven years."
"We hope that this would lead to further reductions in working time and a redistribution of work in the Member States, which are effective ways of reconciling family and professional life, of promoting equal rights for women and of combating unemployment."
"Lastly, I deplore the fact that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats persists in disparaging the report approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which only serves to show that they are perfectly happy to perpetuate an unacceptable state of affairs that undermines effective health and safety protection of workers."
"You can therefore be sure that we shall be voting against these proposals, as we did in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although we have kept afloat in somewhat choppy waters, I do think it quite worthy of comment that the debate is being dominated by a number of speakers from the United Kingdom."
"This is something with which we are not wholly unfamiliar and to which I shall return shortly."
"I want to start by thanking our rapporteur for having drafted an outstanding report."
"Everyone knows how narrow the vote was in our committee, and that it could have had a different result, so the Commission is aware of the differing views that exist in this House."
"We, though, have to look at each of them very carefully."
"This own-initiative report was nevertheless a necessary one."
"We actually wanted to talk about amendments to the directive, of which, as I see it, there is without a doubt a great need."
"I shall also be putting forward arguments as to why this is the case."
"To be sure, the Commission has taken its time, and this is where I endorse Mr Hughes’ comments on the communication with which we have been presented."
"The material available to us and the study as published are enlightening, but they are not normative."
"Those who have dealt with this for some time actually knew what this was about."
"Yet again, as I see it, the actual blame for this rests with the Member States rather than with the Commission."
"A number of Member States are engaging in delaying tactics to gain the temporary support of the others in a while, such as the accession countries, which also may well be advocates of weakening necessary regulation."
"There are, of course also, and not least the employers, and, above all, there is all the heavy lobbying that is going on at the moment."
"As recently as last Thursday lunchtime, I was phoned up by the British social security minister, who asked me what I, for God’s sake, thought I was doing by signing up to a few pertinent amendments."
"I really do think that is going a bit far."
"I am pleased that he wanted to approach me, but I am doing no deals by the by, especially as that would mean bypassing the problems that exist."
"Let me start with the general individual opt-out."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we want, at European level, social minimum rules, especially on highly topical matters where even the ILO – in 1919, I think – said that 48 hours is enough?"
"Do we want a minimum regime?"
"Do we want these rules to be a means of protecting safety and health, or do we want to move towards a situation that is slowly starting to take shape and which I would describe as social policy competition among Member States?"
"That, at the moment, is what this is all about."
"Let me give you one example."
"At the moment – and the Dutch Council of Ministers is also represented here – discussions are going on in the Netherlands about adjusting Dutch legislation on working hours along the lines of the European minimum regime."
"That is to say, in the Netherlands too, it is proposed that the 60 hours should no longer be a matter for consultation, but should be a norm."
"That is certainly going a long way."
"I know that this debate is going on in other countries as well, and I do not think that we can leave it to the social partners."
"On this issue, their advice may be sought, but such advice must not be determinative in the way that several amendments on this point propose."
"I will deal very briefly with workers on call, a problem that we should try to resolve."
"Although I am happy with the Commission’s proposals, there is a great deal left to be done; not only as regards doctors, but also as regards firefighters – and I could say the same of a number of other services."
"This is an issue that is generating a lot of heat in certain Member States."
"As far as I am concerned, we have to be prompt and unambiguous in our dealings with each of them."
"I urge the Irish and the Dutch to give their full attention to this thorny problem, which, within the life of this Parliament, we will probably no longer be dealing with in the form of an amended directive."
"Mr President, I have always considered this directive to be an infringement of workers' rights to work the hours they wish, believing that it is an inalienable right of the individual to chose one's own balance between work and leisure time."
"The legislation was ill-conceived and did not take into consideration the difficulties experienced by small businessmen and by many professions."
"It is essential that the opt-out be retained, in particular for certain occupations."
"In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service could not run without the willingness of dedicated doctors and nursing staff to work long hours."
"In this regard it is imperative to remove the farcical rule that says that a doctor is working when he is asleep in bed purely because, technically, he is on call – but then, common sense is not a capability that this Parliament often utilises."
"The current opt-out is open to all Member States."
"The fact that France, Germany and the Netherlands are now following the UK's example in deploying it in relation to the medical professions serves to demonstrate that the line the UK has always taken is the practical one."
"With enlargement around the corner, some consideration must be given as to how this directive will affect the newcomers' individual labour markets."
"In my own experience when visiting Malta last year, the leading topic for all political parties was the Working Time Directive."
"The majority of people in Malta work in excess of 48 hours per week and need to do so for their own benefit and for the island's economy."
"All Member States need the flexibility to organise their own working time."
"The EU should recognise this and return this responsibility to national governments."
"– If I may put Mr Titford’s mind at rest, the Dutch Government is not following the United Kingdom’s example; it is in fact dealing with another problem, one with which we are also concerning ourselves today."
"On the one hand, it is very irritating that this House is virtually turning into a sort of House of Commons, in that we are now giving our attention solely to problems that are in fact not even specific to the UK, but are specifically English."
"That, of course, becomes very tiresome, especially for those participants in the debate who do not originate from that country."
"There is also the second problematic aspect, namely the legal cases referred to earlier: the Jaeger case and others."
"It ought to have been apparent that the combination of the interpretation of these legal acts and the existence of the opt-out would create difficulties and to the objectives of the directive being undermined."
"It waited a long time and gave what were in fact wholly inadequate answers as to what the solution might be."
"Not to mention such other things as, for example, the people who then think they too can use this for their own purposes by, contrary to what the directive intended, creating more difficulties."
"That can happen at any time and it is at that point that the whole thing starts to unravel."
"This is where I differ from many others in my belief that we have to be quick."
"The fact is that we have to give priority to dealing with the points that are relevant to hospitals, the fire service and a few more of the sort of things that are relevant not only to the United Kingdom; then we will be able to talk about the opt-out."
"That is, at the moment, still inadequately expressed in our report and it is certainly inadequately expressed in what the Commission is saying."
"It is still doing no more than creating options, which seems to indicate that we have a very long process ahead of us, but, at the time, all the Member States resolved to avail themselves of the opt-out, so you never know what is going to happen."
"In conclusion, I myself think an opt-out is always a sign of failure, of your inability to completely sort matters out, which is also the underlying problem here."
"I still think that we have to be looking for alternatives to the opt-out, but you cannot say that you cannot get rid of it unless you offer alternatives."
"If you have no alternative, you cannot say that the opt-out is wrong."
"You have to say, ‘the opt-out is wrong, but here are the alternatives to it’."
"That is what we actually have to work towards with this report."
"We will certainly have to aspire to it in the course of further consultation."
"First, though, we have to close the loophole in the directive as quickly as possible, or in the place where at least the Member States think it is."
"Then we will, in any case, have all the Member States behind us – with the exception of the United Kingdom, but including, I am sure, the Member States in Eastern Europe."
"We can then take a look at the last part of the second opt-out."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a number of remarks by previous speakers relating to firms’ need for leeway and room to manoeuvre, and to their productivity."
"What we are talking about here is not rules on 35-hour or 38-hour weeks, but the option that exists in certain Member States of a week of 55 or more hours."
"I have to say that I regard this opting-out arrangement as absolutely absurd."
"Figures like that belong in the nineteenth century; I am convinced that the productivity of our businesses is not dependent on them and that they will not make us the most modern and the most efficient economic region in Europe."
"What matters most of all to businesses is the options available for machinery’s runtimes and operating times, rather than any unnecessary extension of working time."
"Businesses care about modern forms of labour organisation."
"In fact, Germany is a good example of how the social partners can be involved in the shared development of modern types of employment, organisation of work and working times."
"I might add that it is this that has enabled us to lead the world in the export field."
"Let it also be said that the figures, data and times currently under discussion do not seem to take account of the possibility of workers having such things as children and families."
"Who, after all, is capable of being away from home for 48, 55 or more hours in a week?"
"I might remind you that the Working Times Directive was meant, as one of its objectives, to be an instrument for reconciling work and family life."
"Mr Pronk said something very good about the opt-out, namely that it has actually failed."
"Had it been a derogation with a limited lifespan, nothing could have been said against it."
"Now, though, in the meantime, there are several countries that want to adopt this British model, and it is unfortunate that these include Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and most of the accession countries that will be joining us on 1 May."
"I doubt that the Commissioner will often have come across so much public approval as there has been as a result of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in connection with hospital doctors."
"It is, for this reason, vital that we counteract every tendency to hand these things back to the national level."
"It is in this area that European social policy is under scrutiny, as are guaranteed European standards, for if we make it possible for these matters to be handed back to the national level, you can be sure that the same thing will happen in many other cases in the life of the next Parliament."
"In order to nip that sort of thing in the bud, we want the precise legal framework, which you have promised us."
"We are happy to go along with that, but let there be no turning back!"
"Mr President, it is approximately a hundred years since the labour movement in Europe demanded statutory working time."
"Eight hours’ work, eight hours’ leisure time and eight hours’ sleep were what were then demanded."
"Gradually, that programme was implemented."
"It was important in many ways, because it meant that companies stopped competing on the basis of working time."
"They had to compete in other areas instead."
"It also meant that workers were protected and that society was given a fixed framework for work, schooling, leisure and other activities."
"I am really shocked that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, together with several other political groups, seem to want to break with this tradition and, instead, go back to the situation that existed a hundred years ago when a voluntary ethos prevailed in the labour market."
"I note that there is no talk of voluntary agreements between trade unions and employers’ organisations."
"Instead, the talk is of voluntary agreements between individual employees and individual employers."
"That is a retrograde step that is incomprehensible."
"I do not understand how people can argue in that way or put forward a proposal along those lines."
"It is deeply irresponsible and will lead to strife and conflict in the labour markets."
"In a labour market so exposed to competition, it will lead to a situation in which people are forced to take jobs on the conditions that apply."
"Call it voluntary or involuntary, but the fact is that, in a labour market exposed to competition, people may expect to have a pre-determined market value."
"They have to take what is on offer."
"So much for matters being voluntary."
"As many have said, family life is also affected."
"Parents are forced to work hours that make it difficult to combine work and family life and take care of their children."
"I also want to add that all of us, as consumers, are affected."
"This has not been emphasised so much, but we are in danger, for example, of being injured when we are operated on by exhausted surgeons or of being run over when we encounter lorry drivers that are half asleep. We are all victims of stress and of pressure at work."
"It would be much better for all parties if we could agree to put an end to these opt-outs obtained by the United Kingdom at the time when the directive was adopted."
"In actual fact, they were contrary to the rule concerning competition under equal conditions."
"Now, employers in other countries are saying, ‘If the United Kingdom can have opt-outs, we too want opt-outs.’ This will lead to the exception becoming the rule."
"That is not something we can live with. We must therefore call a halt and instead go down the opposite route."
"We must remove the United Kingdom’s opt-out and find other ways of solving these flexibility problems, for we cannot cope successfully without labour legislation that is applicable across the board."
"Mr President, I welcome this report and I welcome the Commission's public consultation on it."
"For those who are interested, the details are on the website."
"If we are honest we all know the problems that long hours of work bring for health and safety, productivity and social relationships, both for the individual and within the family."
"A number of Member States, for example, are very concerned about children being left without appropriate adult care at times while their parents and carers are at work."
"We know that the 'long hours' culture, for whatever reason, brings strain, stress and potential breakdown."
"I find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with Mr Hughes this evening, and certainly with most of what Mr Pronk said, about the 'on call' issue being resolvable, between social partners, in various sectors and in other ways."
"The issue about who owns your time, who controls it, who says where you have to be at what point, is a key question when deciding whether or not you are actually at work."
"As for the dedication of doctors, yes, there is enormous dedication there but I do not feel safe at the hands of a doctor who has been on call for 72 hours and is swaying with tiredness while he is trying to make a decision how to treat me."
"That is a personal experience."
"We are told that many people want to work longer hours because they really love their jobs – just as we all do. Good."
"But we also recognise that there is more to life than paid work."
"We are seeing again in certain countries a decline in voluntary work, for example, with all the repercussions that has for wider society."
"We are also told that we need additional flexibility so that people can do overtime to earn a living wage."
"If this has to be done on a regular basis, I contend that there is a problem with the basic wage paid, rather than the right to continue compulsory overtime."
"We all know about the pressures exerted by teams to make sure you turn up for that overtime, whether you want to or not."
"A lot of this debate sounds to me at times rather like gender discrimination: people claim it does not exist because they have never experienced it."
"Part of this is the question whether or not people have a real choice, say in the UK with its opt-out, as to whether or not they work longer hours."
"We know of the enormous pressure exerted on people by employers, by methods of working, by just-in-time production, by a whole set of things such as the macho work culture that says you are not dedicated to your job unless you are in at 8 a.m. in the morning and still there at 10 p.m. at night."
"I am sure that a number of the staff in this Parliament will recognise that feeling."
"The issue of flexibility is about who makes that decision."
"I would be happier with a lot of the UK's arguments if I felt there really was a concerted effort by the UK Government to apply the rules."
"But I do not see any evidence of this and it is not what I am hearing at meeting after meeting either."
"Mr President, the Commission has prepared a draft amendment of a directive relating to the EU labour market."
"The purpose of the original directive was, out of health and safety considerations, to safeguard employees against unduly long working days by setting a maximum working time of 48 hours per week."
"The directive nonetheless makes it possible for the employee, by means of his signature, to permit this maximum of 48 hours per week to be worked only as an average over a whole year."
"Employers are accorded flexibility at the expense of employees’ welfare."
"This has, for example, led to millions of Britons increasing their working time to more than 48 hours per week since the directive was introduced."
"It is a sick way in which to organise labour market legislation."
"The directive supports the principle of individual agreements that is contrary to the collective agreement model that exists in Denmark."
"Among Danes, there is considerable backing for the national model in which, for example, working time and wage conditions are established through free negotiations between independent trade unions and employer associations."
"Employees use ballots to agree upon the conditions under which they wish to work."
"The directive on working time is an example of the EU’s needing to keep clear of labour market policy and leave this to the Member States."
"The proximity principle must be taken seriously."
"Unfortunately, we are now in a situation in which the EU has already legislated in this area."
"The report on revising the directive proposes closing those gaps in it that employers have misused to exploit the unfair individual agreements."
"In practice, employers have, upon employing people, in many cases put pressure on them to accept longer working hours."
"This individualisation is unacceptable as a basis for labour market agreements."
"To conclude, therefore, we are voting in favour of the rapporteur’s report and against the majority of the many amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, we are dealing with a report which I believe to be of profound social, legal and political importance."
"This is because the completion of the internal market must lead to an improvement in working conditions, because the Community will support and complement the Member States’ actions in the fields of health and safety protection of workers, as laid down in Article 137 of the EC Treaty, and because all workers have the right to a restriction of maximum working time, to daily and weekly periods of rest, and an annual period of paid holiday, as well as to work in conditions which respect their health, their safety and their dignity, as laid down in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The issue is very simple, therefore, on a theoretical level."
"The first aspect is the reference periods for the application of Article 6 (maximum weekly working time): four months, as laid down in Article 16 of the Directive, or, where appropriate, the possibility of extension in the cases laid down in Article 17: up to six and twelve months if implemented by means of collective agreements or agreements between social partners."
"The second aspect is the power not to apply Article 6 if the worker is in agreement, the system of opting-out, as has been said here already."
"Clearly, a consequence of extending the reference periods would be to increase the flexibility available to companies."
"The only limit would be the eleven hours of rest daily or the twenty-four hours of rest weekly, but the directive would be losing its purpose and only regulating the maximum four-monthly, six-monthly or annual working time, depending on the particular case."
"With regard to opting-out, the potential for abuse is obvious, particularly in a situation of legal equality but not economic equality between the protagonists in working life."
"Directive 93/104/EC is intended to guarantee a higher level of health and safety protection for workers, as reiterated in Directive 2000/34/EC."
"We should therefore seek effective solutions to the cases and activities which require them, such as those involved in the judgments mentioned here, Simap or Jäger, but with objective criteria and conditions, to be used generally and in a non-abusive fashion; and under no circumstances turning the exception into the general rule."
"I therefore believe that before the vote we should seek agreements which combine legal guarantees for workers with creating more flexibility, in the spirit of Directive 93/104/EC."
"Mr President, a number of references were made to us, the British Labour MEPs."
"We clearly recognise the importance of this issue for our political group and for working people, particularly the issue of work/life balance and health and safety."
"That has been established and eloquently spoken about by a number of speakers."
"We do not want to see a long-hours culture; we want to see higher productivity."
"We want to see working people have the kind of work that allows them the leisure they deserve."
"We fully support the repeated statements by our government stating that the opt-out should not be abused and that the exercise of the opt-out must be truly voluntary to be legal under UK law."
"We need clarification of the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments."
"As British Labour MEPs, we also believe that it is inappropriate for infringement proceedings to be taken against the UK Government."
"We have tabled Amendment 1, which deletes the recommendation that the UK Government should be subject to infringement proceedings."
"However, we believe in the principle of working time and want to see progress, particularly in the health sector."
"Mr President, the proposals by the European Commission on working time obey the demands of the employers for flexible working time."
"They increase the level of exploitation of the working class and maximise the profits of big business."
"According to these proposals, workers will be at the immediate disposal of employers whenever, when and for as long as the employer wants, without overtime pay, a fact which the European Court of Justice itself has condemned."
"Thus they abolish basic rights of the workers, such as a set working day, eight hours or seven hours, five days a week."
"Collective working agreements are being cast aside and fixed term contracts are being extended."
"The right to insurance and normal leave is being violated, while greater flexibility in employment relations is being promoted."
"Any positive arrangements are gainsaid by the planned derogations and the application of the 'opting-out' clause imposed by the United Kingdom and also used by other countries."
"In it, the workers are dragged under the pressure of securing a job."
"It is a form of modern paid slavery, which forces a large percentage of the workforce to work an average of between 48 and 70 hours a week, with deteriorating health and safety conditions and very serious repercussions on the mental and physical health of workers."
"We support the reduction in working time, the introduction of a genuine 35-hour week of seven set working hours a day, five days a week, an increase in wages and full insurance and employment rights which will apply universally to all workers and all enterprises."
"We are fighting together with the workers to overturn the current anti-labour framework and flexible forms of employment."
"Mr President, I would like to stress the importance of the text on which we are going to vote on the revision of the directive on the organisation of working time, which, as Mr Pronk stressed, Commissioner, ought to have taken place by 23 November 2003."
"It is because we have waited for too long that we find ourselves in this situation."
"Recently, President Prodi presented to us a document entitled ‘Delivering Lisbon’."
"We cannot deny that, to make Europe the most dynamic economic power in the world, we need to have policies that perform to help businesses adapt to new production conditions and to ever-increasing economic competition whilst taking into account the safety and health of workers."
"This is why, in order to adapt to the realities of the market, we need to evolve in a relatively flexible framework."
"Given this, organisation of working time is dependent on a number of factors and on the characteristics of the sector of activity concerned and of the profession in question."
"It is on that basis, for example, that we have already legislated for mobile workers in the transport sector, but we have recognised and accepted the concept of flexibility for people driving goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. We also have a certain number of problems as regards homeworkers and also those working in situations that involve caring for others, because private and professional life are often intermingled in this area."
"That is the first point."
"The second point is that, in addition to these differences according to sectors, we must draw attention to the specific characteristics of national industrial relations systems."
"Some Member States call on collective or workforce agreements to establish the average working time, whilst others resort to individual derogations which make it possible for workers in, for example, supervisory positions, not to be subjected to restrictions in working time."
"I do, of course, agree with the fact that the European Union is duty bound to lay down minimum conditions governing the organisation of working time in order to guarantee a high level of health and safety protection for workers."
"Should it not at the same time, though, give enterprises the option of reacting contrary to general practice when faced with different constraints?"
"This is why it seems to me that the rapporteur’s opinion would have to be qualified by accepting, for example, as you initially proposed, Commissioner, the gradual abolition of the opt out, provided for in Article 18 of the Directive, in return for the introduction, in the future draft revision of the directive, of a derogation at Article 6 to allow periods of inactivity partially to be taken into account."
"This would probably be a transitional solution that would make it possible to have minimal social rules whilst, at the same time, taking into account the constraints of each sector."
"Mr President, the basis of the whole working time directive is now in the process of being eroded."
"Pressure is being exerted from two sides."
"This comes firstly in relation to the individual opt-out."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Lynne are very enthusiastic about these individual opt-outs."
"I think, however, that we are obliged now to ask them why, if individual opt-outs are so fantastic, this provision should not be extended to apply to all legislation concerning health and safety in the workplace."
"Why stop here?"
"Why not go further and include noise, asbestos and other areas if it is such a splendid principle?"
"There is also a prevailing misunderstanding that it is the individual opt-out that makes it possible to work long hours."
"I should like to invite both Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Lynne to get out and about in Europe and visit a few workplaces and to come to Denmark where they will see that it is, in actual fact, possible to work very long hours in various industries in Denmark and, at the same time, to comply with the directive, for it is very flexible."
"Nor, at the same time, must we of course forget that we are concerned here with health and safety in the workplace."
"It is not just something that the Social Democrats have lighted upon in order to be officious and over-zealous or in order to limit individual flexibility."
"We also know that the statistics are clear in their implications."
"We know that there is a clear connection between long working hours and accidents at work."
"Moreover, it is generally known that the number of sick days is increasing and that long working hours do not in actual fact mean higher productivity."
"Nor can we ignore the fact that it is women who will be placed in a difficult position if we simply extend working time, the natural consequence being that a number of women will perhaps withdraw completely from the labour market."
"I am certain that the right-hand side of the Chamber too will appreciate that this would be very unfortunate for the European economy."
"The second pressure on the working time directive stems directly from the fact that the Commission has neglected to say what it intends to do as a consequence of the Jaeger and SIMAP Judgments."
"These rigid judgments have sent shock waves through the national and regional health authorities which simply cannot imagine how they are to make ends meet if on-call hours are to be fully charged for."
"I would go so far as to say to the Commission that, if it does not do something soon and produce a proposal, it will itself contribute to the image of the EU as something removed from the real world and unable to come up with flexible solutions."
"We badly need a revision of the directive that abolishes the individual opt-out but that constantly provides for flexibility where there is a need for this, for example in the health sector."
"I would also ask the right wing today to take note of the fact that no one is asking for a very rigid directive."
"We are all asking for flexibility, but we must not of course destroy the principles behind having legislation in this area."
"Finally, I should like to ask for the revised directive also clearly to indicate that it can be implemented with the help of collective agreements."
"I say this not just to harp on about time-honoured Danish practices, but also because this method of implementation puts a stop to the individual ways of doing things and, at the same time, provides for a very high-level implementation of the directive."
"That is why this is a sound way of proceeding, and that is why I should like to ask the Commission specifically to state in the directive that the directive can be implemented by means of collective agreements."
"Mr President, the exercise that we are currently carrying out to revise a 1993 directive on the organisation of working time is worthwhile."
"It should not, however, have diverged either needlessly or too far from the objective pursued, that is to say the possible amendment of the directive in order to guarantee a better level of health and safety protection for workers."
"The opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is, unfortunately, another typical example of that very process, since it made a brilliant job of missing the point of the report."
"I had tabled a series of amendments aimed at removing from the text of this opinion the obvious falsehoods, according to which working hours are apparently being extended all over the place in the European Union and long working hours being imposed in our Member States, with negative effects on our health, well-being and appetite for life."
"The opinion then concludes by heaping criticism on the would-be culture of long working hours for high level professionals and others, managers in particular."
"These generalisations and falsehoods do not serve our objective, designed to promote a better level of health and safety protection for workers."
"For some here, a massive reduction in working time is the universal remedy for all problems."
"That being said, I agree that the Lisbon Agenda, which sets the goal of a 60% employment rate for women by 2010, will not be respected without prior progress in reconciling professional life and family responsibilities."
"I also agree that couples need to be better at dividing domestic tasks and educational responsibilities and, on this subject, there should be a response on the part of men, because women are still forced to take on, to a disproportionate degree, the double burden of professional work, on the one hand, and of family responsibilities on the other."
"I regret that my attempts to qualify the statements of some Members and to re-establish the truth did not find favour with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and, above all, I regret that the rapporteur repeated certain falsehoods, in particular that which would have us believe that working hours continue to be extended in the European Union when, in the majority of Member States, the opposite is true."
"My group has tabled a host of amendments designed to re-establish truth and reason on this sensitive issue and aimed, in particular, at those populists who would have our European citizens believe that they can always work a lot less to earn a lot more than their colleagues in other parts of the world."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, who has prepared a very constructive report."
"Sometimes when I listen to the speeches, I get the feeling that health and safety aspects as they relate to the private individual – which, strictly speaking, is what the legislation is really about – are not the main point."
"I am, to be honest, frightened when I hear the British representatives of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"They say that, in view of the fact that certain jobs have such low wages, we must allow employees to work longer hours so as to compensate for these low wages."
"What is this other than the model that exists in the United States where people sometimes need two or three jobs in order to be at all able to take care of their families?"
"Is that what we agreed to in the Lisbon Process?"
"Certainly, we must have competitiveness and growth, but we must also have challenging social objectives and the opportunity to combine family life and working life."
"These principles, about which we have expressed our opinions, are directly contrary to flexibility of that kind."
"The problem is that the exception has become the rule in the United Kingdom."
"It is never the intention that an exception should become the rule, but it has become so in the UK."
"If the opt-out is extended, there is a danger of the Member States competing by means of longer working time in order to attract production."
"Is that the kind of Europe we want: one in which we compete in terms of social legislation?"
"No, I do not want a Europe like that."
"I think, however, that we must have flexibility, just as Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said."
"I do not, however, see the individual opt-out as a possibility."
"Think how dependent the individual employees are on their companies when they are to agree upon wages and working time."
"The word ‘voluntary’ does not apply, no matter what people say."
"It is much better to involve the two sides of industry."
"There are differences between various industries and, sometimes, certain industries may require special arrangements in order to achieve flexibility and, at the same time, maintain the principles of health and safety."
"I therefore recommend collective agreements through which this flexibility can be achieved."
"I am not in favour of renationalisation, because it would have the same effect."
"It would mean countries competing with each other by attracting capital available to them because of their not prioritising health and safety."
"We want to use our European model to stimulate competitiveness but, at the same time, have challenging social objectives and the opportunity of combining working life and parenthood."
"Let us comply with this model, in which case we must remove the individual opt-out, at the same time as preserving flexibility and a high level of safety."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at noon on Wednesday."
"The next item is the report (A5-0013/2004) by Colette Flesch, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2003 (2003/2007(INI))."
"Mr President, debates on this report in the Committee on Development and Cooperation took place in a constructive climate, and I would like to thank Members for the amendments that they tabled and that it was possible to incorporate into this report, thus improving the motion for a resolution put to you."
"The striking fact of 2003 was certainly that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly could return to a normal rhythm of work following the cancellation of the November 2002 session due to circumstances of which you are aware. On this issue, the result of the mission carried out by the ACP Co-President and four ACP parliamentarians in Harare should be particularly welcomed."
"They managed to persuade the Zimbabwean Government to agree to the head of its delegation in the Assembly no longer being someone who is covered by the Council’s restrictive measures."
"The ACP Co-President’s personal commitment to ensuring that only the head of the Zimbabwean delegation can take the floor during the session in Rome should also be welcomed."
"Aside from this important aspect, six points deserve to be mentioned as regards the work of the Assembly in 2003."
"The entry into force of the new Rules of Procedure allowed the debates to be better structured."
"The more informal organisation of Question Time with the Commission, at the sixth session in Rome, proved its worth and led to a livelier debate."
"It was possible to organise and carry out four joint missions in 2003."
"The Women’s Forum was a success both at the 5th session in Brazzaville and at the 6th session in Rome."
"It was possible to significantly improve and deepen cooperation between the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the United Nations."
"Finally, two important reports were adopted, one on children’s rights, and those of child soldiers in particular, and the other on the use of the European Development Fund and the discussions initiated on its budgetisation."
"For the future, Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation basically proposes to invite the Assembly and its Bureau to continue to organise Question Time to make it livelier and more informal; to re-balance the agenda of the sessions and to give more speaking time to Members of the Assembly; to ensure better continuity between sessions by strengthening the facilities of the Standing Committees; to improve the availability of documents, in particular via greater use of the Internet; to develop the role of the Assembly in the implementation of the political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement; to continue its work on human rights through greater involvement of civil society; to make practical arrangements for sending to Zimbabwe a joint delegation, freely chosen, provided that it can move around freely and meet anyone it wishes; to develop the role of the Assembly as a forum for dialogue with the World Trade Organisation; and, finally to take into consideration the desire of Members of the Assembly that the sessions in Europe take place under good conditions, outside of the workplaces of the European Parliament."
"To summarise, Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation gives a positive view of 2003."
"The difficulties of the previous year, which culminated in the cancellation of the session of November 2002, have been overcome thanks to efforts on both sides, in particular from the Co-Presidents and the Bureau of the Assembly."
"The latter was also able to resume a normal rhythm of work."
"Improvements have been made to the organisation of its work, allowing it to make its voice heard more clearly and to actively participate in the political dialogue provided for in the Cotonou Agreement."
"I hope, Mr President, that our Assembly will be able to adopt the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
". Mr President, I should like first of all to express my satisfaction on this very informative report concerning the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which is very useful not only for us, but also for the interested agencies which somehow create relations between Europe and these countries."
"As the members of the Assembly know and as noted in Mrs Flesch's report, my colleague Poul Nielson is actively involved in the work of this Assembly and the Commission services are trying in any way they can to support it with documents and information, while the experts in the standing committees are also now preparing the Assembly reports."
"Thus, I think that the Commission's genuine interest is clear, as is its close and efficient cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"I should like to mention three points."
"The first is that we absolutely welcome the setting up of these three standing committees following the approval of the new rules of procedure in 2003."
"Thanks to preparatory cooperation between these committees, the reports present a high degree of accuracy and the debates in plenary are much clearer, specific and detailed."
"Secondly, I believe that the setting up of the Women's Forum is very important. This forum has provided the possibility for women's opinions to be heard and the possibility for mutual support."
"Thus, there is the possibility for the Assembly's proposals to be enriched with issues which relate to equality of the two sexes and the broader participation of women."
"Finally, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a very important forum for political dialogue between MEPs and MPs from the ACP countries and, consequently, it is the Commission's duty to support this entire effort."
"I should like to take advantage of the seventh plenary Assembly in Addis Ababa to inform you, even though you already know, that two of our colleagues, Pοul Nielson and Pascal Lamy, will be speaking, and I should like to express my best wishes for a successful Assembly."
"Mr President, the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly contains some important considerations."
"It is good to see that the degree and quality of cooperation between the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the United Nations reached unprecedented levels."
"I think its is especially worthwhile that enhanced cooperation with the UN is visible in the matter of child soldiers, as is evident from the report."
"This is an area where the battle cannot be ended before it is completely won."
"Even one child soldier is a gross injustice to humanity and its future."
"There are an estimated 300 000 child soldiers under the age of 18 involved in some 40 conflicts throughout the world."
"Using children as soldiers is a violation of their human rights and deprives them of their childhood and the chance for education and building a better future as a result."
"Being a soldier always causes serious psychological and often also physical damage in children."
"The use of child soldiers has increased with, for example, the development of weapons technology, as children can be made to use ever lighter and smaller weapons."
"The reason for the increase in the use of child soldiers is also due to the nature of modern warfare: most of today’s armed conflicts are civil wars."
"In the time of the First World War just 10% of the war’s casualties were civilians."
"Now the corresponding figure is 90%."
"Civil wars are waged between different ethic groups, which in practice means civilian populations."
"In this way children become targets and easily recruited additional troops."
"Children obey orders more readily than adults."
"Children have had to witness atrocities and carry them out themselves under coercion."
"Many guerrilla movements even prefer child soldiers to fully-grown combatants."
"Furthermore, children are prepared to take risks that adults would refuse to."
"One example is Iran, where children were used as messengers in minefields."
"The International Save the Children Alliance was heard when the UN Security Council met in mid-January 2003 to discuss the plight of children in armed conflicts."
"The debate was preceded by the third report by the UN Secretary-General on children and armed conflicts."
"For the first time in an official report those responsible for using child soldiers were named."
"This is a significant step forward because it allows international pressure to be put on those who grossly violate children’s rights."
"This otherwise excellent report is still in need of some small stylistic improvements."
"The Question Time in Rome was certainly animated, as points 6 and 26 state and which is all too commendable, but as it is actually mentioned twice, one gets the impression that this is an altogether unusual exception to the rule and that the basic nature of our work is lifeless and anaemic."
"Mr President, I can assure the last speaker that we are neither lifeless nor anaemic in the work that we undertake in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"The references which the excellent rapporteur makes are to the fact that we now have a parliamentary status and a very different way of working but, most important, the ACP representation is of elected Members of Parliament and not of ambassadors, which used to be the case in the past."
"I am sure if the previous speaker were to look at the evidence she would see that was the case."
"It is because we have this parliamentary status under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement that we have a new and dynamic maturity."
"The parliamentary assembly is a very special institution: it is the democratic arm of ACP-EU cooperation and provides a voice for the people in the 93 countries which are represented there."
"It is our task to build credible and workable partnerships through dialogue and consultation between our respective parliaments."
"In our last Joint Assembly we worked on the EPA trade negotiations, human rights, governance, the European Development Fund and environmental concerns."
"Our entire effort is to ensure that we deliver the promise and vision of Cotonou."
"Our work should reflect that unique subscription between the EU and 78 ACP countries to those values which are enshrined in the agreement."
"Those values are central to our work here in Parliament and to our work with developing countries, and that is democracy, the rule of law and, above all, the eradication of poverty."
"We are conscious of the difference of opportunity that exists between our ACP colleagues and ourselves."
"We have access to staff and technology to assist us with our work, and far greater opportunities to cooperate and work together, as we are now in our preparations for Addis Ababa at the end of this week."
"In addition, we have far more of a tradition of parliamentary scrutiny."
"I am delighted that Commissioner Nielson has on a number of occasions expressed his support for the Joint Assembly and for financial resources to be made available for us to be more effective in our work and for the participation of ACP Parliaments to be greater, because, after all, it is their legitimacy and accountability as parliamentarians that is at the heart of our work."
"I am encouraged by the growing confidence of ACP parliamentarians, and that has been demonstrated, as Mrs Flesch says, by the extensive participation now from both sides in the debates we are having."
"We comment on it because it is growing and developing as confidence increases."
"In the past it was the European parliamentarians who dominated every debate and that, I am glad to say, is no longer the case."
"They are absolutely hungry for information in order that they can be more effective in their parliaments."
"I know that some countries – such as Senegal – are making a priority of parliamentary training and capacity-building in their national indicative programmes."
"But we need to do more to encourage more JPA parliaments to have this facility."
"We are now preparing for the seventh session of the JPA in Addis Ababa this weekend and I am sure that we will continue to work in an increasingly impressive and focused way in 2003."
"– Mrs Flesch, I should like to congratulate you mainly on the tone of the positive, yet critical, remarks in your explanation."
"I am finding it a little harder to come to terms with certain euphoric elements that I will highlight in the text itself."
"As Mrs Kinnock pointed out at great length, the new Rules of Procedure of the ACS-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly have created structures allowing for a real, fruitful dialogue."
"It appears to me a little premature to herald it as a world model at this stage."
"There is no doubt that in future, it can become a world model in the field of development cooperation and a place in which people with equal rights can have an open and transparent dialogue, about democracy and the protection of human rights, thus enabling us to enter into binding agreements with each other."
"We are not that far yet."
"There are structures in place and both sides must now make effective use of them."
"This will require an increase in resources on the ACP side and quite possibly, a change in mentality on both, because the EU partner will also change following the accession of ten new countries."
"I wonder whether the sound results which we have already achieved in the joint working party, and which are reflected, among others, in the report on child soldiers, can be repeated shortly in our general assembly, where the tone of discussion has picked up a great deal, even though I still sometimes miss the ACP's equal participation."
"Our forum should develop into an effective North-South Parliament with a real impact on the orientation of our attitudes, for example with regard to world trade."
"Not only do we want trade, we also want trade."
"I think that we will have to determine our policy in tandem with the ACP beforehand and that we should not always agree among the rich before we head to a conference in Cancun or wherever."
"The UN's Millennium Declaration lists major issues in which we would like to make real improvement, for example by halving global poverty and with regard to good governance, health, education and an end to the oppression of women, these should all be items on the agenda, the progress of which we can measure in the framework of the ACP-EU meetings."
"We must become real partners in the development of North and South, and I should like to emphasise that consultation is necessary at all times if we are to be spared the disastrous effects of such incidents as those in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, the cooperation system that links the European Union to the ACP countries is marked by a dual evolution in opposite directions."
"On the one hand, the original institutions implemented by the Lomé Conventions and confirmed by the Cotonou Convention, notably the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, have manifestly endured and are livelier than ever, and the report by Mrs Flesch clearly shows the innovative developments in the Joint Assembly in 2003."
"At the same time, however, the objectives and the substance of the cooperation, which these institutions are there to implement, are tending to weaken, degenerate, be trivialised, break apart and dissolve, to the point where, soon – if we let this carry on – they will consist only of financial aid with an upper limit and of standard free trade agreements that could be more a source of difficulty for the ACP countries than real instruments to aid their development."
"As the rapporteur stresses, the creation in 2003 of three standing committees, in particular a Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade responsible for looking at the extremely delicate issue of negotiating future partnership agreements, reinforces the continuity of the Parliamentary Assembly and allows the quality of its work to be improved."
"The system of co-rapporteurs is original, and the work of the committee will lead to stronger, more finely tuned, better prepared and less routine resolutions, which will lead to much more in-depth debates than was possible in the plenary."
"If, however, the institutional framework is enhanced and fine-tuned, we need to ask ourselves about the future of the cooperation instruments themselves."
"If future economic partnership agreements merely apply the principle of equality of competitors, is there not a risk that they will create insurmountable accounting problems for ACP countries by making them lose out on a large part of their customs revenue, which is an important, and sometimes an essential, part of their budget?"
"Moreover, is there not a risk that putting Community merchandise and local products in direct competition with each other without sufficient safeguards will weaken or even suffocate a number of sectors of activity in the ACP countries?"
"If we want to do our bit to avoid these wayward developments, then this unique North-South parliamentary forum that is the Joint Assembly, must ensure that major negotiation of partnership agreements is carried out with the necessary ambition and energy, in particular in the area of agriculture, which is the platform for development."
"The ACP countries will, however, only have a sufficiently strong agriculture if it is adequately protected as a budding industry as it gets off the ground."
"The Cotonou framework, that of regional economic zones, can be seen as the most appropriate framework to promote the establishment of homogeneous regional common markets with a common external tariff."
"It is by working in this direction, Mr President, that ACP and European countries will no longer find themselves on different playing fields in future negotiations regarding agriculture and world trade."
"Mr President, allow me firstly to say that the report is constructive and provides a correct description of the work in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"The work has acquired a better structure with the three committees, something that has improved the preparatory work prior to the plenary."
"Question time has also improved."
"It may of course be further improved if the answers to the questions reach MEPs in good time, so that the Commission does not merely read out the answers but provides scope for debate."
"I personally should like to emphasise the constructive cooperation between the ACP-EU Assembly and the UN when it comes both to child soldiers and children’s vulnerability in war and to the debate concerning the International Criminal Court."
"These are two major and important political issues of precisely the kind that our Assembly should engage with, for they are about finding sound forms of cooperation in which both sides learn from each other and support the policy we consider to be important in the international arena."
"The United States has removed its financial support from those countries that do not back the US’s demands that all Americans in general must be exempted from being brought before the International Criminal Court for serious war crimes."
"This measure can and must be supported both politically and financially by the ACP-EU, especially by the EU."
"It is gratifying to note that, of the Latin American and West Indian countries, it is only Belize that has given in to the US’s action and, of the African countries, only Nigeria, whose President ratified an agreement with the United States that was contrary to the Nigerian constitution and in defiance of the Nigerian Parliament."
"It is gratifying that most other countries have resisted the pressure from the United States."
"The ACP-EU Assembly plays an important political and economic role in major, crucial issues in the international arena."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0015/2004) by Hans Modrow, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries with focus on public utilities: the need to assess all the options (COM(2003) 326 – 2003/2158(INI))"
"and"
"the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on European Community cooperation with third countries: the Commission’s approach to future support for the development of the business sector (COM(2003) 267 – 2003/2158(INI)."
". – Mr President, this report is based on two Commission communications, both of which are evidence of the efforts the Commission is making to take action in the areas to which they refer, whilst not drawing a veil over the highly contradictory way in which the process is moving now that it is underway."
"It follows that the underlying principle – of cautious and balanced actions – is the right one."
"The Commission has various options in mind for the reform process, and the report makes reference to them."
"For the rapporteur, the most important thing is still that every orientation and every reform measure must be aimed at combating poverty, consistently and without ideological blinkers."
"Containing poverty, and eventually overcoming it, will be the greatest challenge facing the human race in the twenty-first century."
"The progress made so far is, however, modest at best, and new setbacks are constantly hindering or even nullifying it."
"It is for that reason that the report, like the Commission communication, discusses a wide variety of options, although there is no mistaking the different emphases and priorities adopted by the Commission and the rapporteur."
"Although services of general interest are the subject of controversy in the Member States of the European Union, they may, in those countries, be regarded as relatively stable, but problems are nevertheless ever-present."
"That is far more the case in the developing countries and will remain so for longer, for they often totter on the brink of a catastrophe."
"The European Union’s efforts should, above all, be devoted to supporting and motivating them."
"Whilst the Commission, and also several of my fellow-Members of this House, are strongly in favour of privatisation, all the experience we have had, including in the EU’s Member States, leads me to urge that, along with a responsible role for the public sector and the State, the focus should be on cooperative solutions and also the involvement of the private sector in these states."
"In the private business sector, priority should be given to the promotion and development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lay the foundation for more jobs and self-supporting economic development in developing countries."
"I cannot, in principle, endorse Mr Deva’s amendments."
"Were they to be adopted, the report would lose its critical view of things and would not be equal to the nuanced handling of the reform process that is necessary."
"Nor, too, are they in line with the primary tendency of the report as adopted by the committee."
"Finally, they do not go as far as the Commission in terms of willingness to enter into dialogue, and are incompatible with the character of the reform process."
"As rapporteur, I have endeavoured to propose and achieve workable solutions."
"Far from sticking rigidly to principles and to ideological points of view, everything should be subordinated to the great goal of the war on poverty."
". Mr President, the Commission welcomes the report by Mr Modrow and the support which it gives to the application of the two communications."
"It is clear that the Commission, with these two communications, is trying to highlight the importance of the business sector to development."
"The development of businesses and the existence of a dynamic private sector are basic factors in economic development and are the main source of employment in developing countries, especially if account is taken of the unofficial sector of the economy."
"We outlined the experience which the Commission has as regards the support of the private sector, the benefits which derive from action at Community level and the need to harmonise the various means."
"Thus, we can determine sectors which reflect the actions undertaken by the Commission, on the one hand, and those which are rightly left to others to implement, on the other."
"As far as state-owned enterprises are concerned, our intention is to contribute to their reform in developing countries."
"It is clear that there are huge losses and inefficiency in state-owned enterprises but, of course, this reform needs to be integrated into the framework of plans to restore macro-economic and financial balances and promote development."
"We avoided adopting easy or simplified ideological approaches."
"Finally, we have not put an end to the discussion on ownership, by which I mean if they are state-owned or private enterprises or partnerships between the public and private sectors."
"Our objective is to expose all the arguments and analyse them so that, once we have objectively got all the interpretations, we can make a final choice which reflects the needs of each country and each sector."
"I would remind you that the Commission has always had a constant position on these programmes, which always took account of the social repercussions of programmes to liberate the economy and it is interesting that, over the years, even the Bretton Woods institutions have adopted the same stand."
"We recognise the huge importance of domestic investors, as well as the investments which European small- and medium-sized enterprises can make, especially those which have experience and knowledge."
"We highlight the need to lay down suitable regulatory frameworks and supervisory mechanisms; these are issues of vital importance on which the Commission wishes to put its experience and the high level of expertise which it has at the disposal of the developing countries."
"As I mentioned, we place great emphasis on the need to attract investors and create a favourable environment."
"This strategy has as its objective the development of the credit sector in developing countries, the promotion, as an efficient means of funding, of small enterprises and micro-credit institutions which play a vital role in granting small loans to the unofficial sector of the economy, which mainly includes enterprises run by women."
"The two communications are complementary and have been drafted on the criterion and with the ultimate objective of further reducing poverty."
"I hope that, with the debate in Parliament and your resolution on it, we shall make a better contribution to the understanding of the need to invigorate business development in these countries and help the necessary reform of state-owned enterprises."
". Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Modrow, for taking the initiative to produce a report on this important subject."
"I am pleased to be associated with the report as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy. I am particularly pleased that the Committee on Development and Cooperation decided to integrate fully the recommendations which I made on behalf of the Industry Committee."
"I would like to highlight what I believe are some of the key elements in the reform of state-owned and private enterprises in developing countries."
"Later in the week, corporate governance is on the agenda in this House, following the recent Parmalat case in Italy."
"We are all aware also of the Enron scandal in the United States."
"In other words, the issues of the efficient running of enterprises are as pertinent in western, developed market economies as they are in developing countries."
"Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that a thriving and efficient private sector can play a major role in developing the economy of third countries and in combating poverty."
"I fully support the idea of EU assistance to the business sector in developing countries through intermediaries."
"I share the Commission's view that reforms of state-owned enterprises must take account of the capacity and resources of the countries involved."
"Many of the enterprises in question are essential to development in the fields of energy, water, transport and infrastructure."
"Reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries should not be confined to privatisation measures."
"An overriding goal should be to ensure affordable access to services of general interest, such as water supply, drainage, energy supply, education and health services."
"The EU should encourage reform strategies which involve domestic investors and devote particular attention to decentralised solutions involving small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In conclusion, I believe that businesses in developing countries should be assisted, particularly in the fields of good governance, institution building and consultancy."
"Our own SME sector should be actively engaged in this process."
"Mr President, I applaud the development of the rapporteur's ideas in recent years on this subject."
"I enjoyed working with him in the Committee on Development and Cooperation on this report."
"There is no single holistic approach to the management of public utilities that fits all developing countries."
"Evidence from post-independent developing countries in the past 50 years shows that state-owned enterprises have, in the majority of cases, failed to efficiently and cost-effectively provide water, waste management, municipal services, road transport, aviation services, mining, reforestation and energy supplies, thereby making them a considerable burden on the state budget, hindering economic growth and impoverishing the poorest."
"Poverty, diseases and lost economic opportunities have increased because of the state management of public utilities by bureaucrats whose first priority is job security and not economic efficiency: just look at the failed Soviet system."
"It is imperative to get the private sector involved in the provision of public services in developing countries in order to increase cost efficiency as well as economic growth."
"The private sector alone can generate sustainable employment and is the driving force of every modern economy."
"Public utilities in developing countries should be privatised through open international procedures that are transparent, quick and not onerous, and able to meet sustainable development and public interest criteria."
"Ideally, the award of a tender should be the sole task of an independent, foreign financial institution, acting alone, according to international norms and reporting conditions, and one that has no conflict of interest in that country or in that project."
"I have studied this process for many years and have sadly come to a very sad and bitter conclusion: many foreign direct investors are put off by tedious and laborious tender procedures, consultants' reports, evaluation committees and committees to evaluate other evaluations – devices constructed by officials of developing countries and consultants to international bodies to earn money either through fees or corruption."
"These procedures are an open door to the impoverishment of countries through delay, vacillation and corruption."
"The more decision-makers there are in the loop, the more corruption there is."
"Such corruption takes various forms."
"The first form is that of accelerating a decision and overlooking a better bid by making payments to high government officials, such as are to be found in East Asian countries."
"The other form of less detectable corruption to be found in South Asian countries and Africa is making payments to block the success of another more favourable bid by a competitor."
"In the former case, despite the corruption and the more inferior services now provided, the job gets done and some form of utility is provided, while in the latter nothing ever gets done and the economy suffers."
"The former is endemic in the North and East Asian countries, while the latter is epidemic in South Asia and Africa."
"When large transnational companies are encouraged to invest, through foreign direct investment, in developing countries, they should also be empowered to make offset investments. By offset investments I mean that they should be able to put a part of that investment into social capacity-building, into schools, hospitals, training colleges and youth centres, so that there is a public element in the privatisation of a public utility whereby everybody around the utility benefits."
"This is the way forward, with transparency and openness."
"Mr President, I want to refer to the part of the report which concerns the reform of state-owned enterprises."
"I welcome the Commission's communication and I agree with the Commissioner that we need reform of state-owned enterprises."
"When resources are tight, we need to ensure that they are used effectively."
"I also agree that we have to be sensitive to the needs of the countries involved and not adopt dogmatic solutions."
"If you look at our own history, public services have played a vital role in our economic development: they helped to end poverty and disease, and, by adopting the principle of universal access to public services, we managed to help eradicate poverty, raise living standards and create more equal societies."
"When we are looking at public services in the developing world, we must also focus on the eradication of poverty as a top priority of our reform of public services and state enterprises."
"There is one other key ingredient we should not miss out on and that is the principle of public accountability."
"That accountability should include scrutiny by elected representatives, independent regulation and the involvement of civil society and NGOs."
"We have some models of good practice in our own countries to show how public services can be held accountable."
"If we have more accountability built into the way we look at reform in these countries, I am sure we will have the kind of public services which deliver for people, make sure resources are used effectively and help us to pursue our own development goals of eradicating poverty and raising living standards."
"Mr President, I will first of all give my enthusiastic support to the report by my colleague Mr Modrow, in which, to their credit, the two Commission Communications open up the debate on the position, role and responsibilities of State-owned and private enterprises in developing countries."
"According to Mr Modrow, the report has the virtue of pointing out the contradictions, and sometimes even the inconsistencies, in the European policy."
"The Union is not actually impartial on the issue of strengthening or not strengthening State-owned sectors in countries with which it has close relations."
"Unfortunately, it too often advocates a policy of reducing public costs and deficits in response to the structural adjustment measures dear to international financial institutions, a policy which, in its wording, admittedly seeks to reduce poverty but which in reality can end up being to the total detriment of the peoples concerned."
"In this way, the incentives and pressures exerted on these countries with a view to privatising their economies has a price, and this is a high price to be paid by the men and women in these countries, a high price for the employees concerned, there as here."
"There is a chronic lack of connection between economic and financial objectives, and the need to satisfy, above all else, the needs and fundamental rights of these peoples."
"In this framework, the often too exclusive call on the private sector is at best a deception and at worst a seizure of economic, social and political power, which slips from the control of the peoples in these countries."
"We are aware of the drastic social consequences of this."
"If this is not the case, why then does the Commission always refuse to carry out a transparent, public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment, on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in Europe itself?"
"Yet, such an assessment would render more credible its call for the European Union’s experience on this matter to be considered."
"If combining a strong and modern State-owned sector and private enterprises could be desirable to meet needs, in particular in the services area, it is nonetheless a fact that the call for public-private partnerships at present actually does more to weaken public enterprises than to create an overall dynamic."
"Faced with the jungle of competition, the safeguards – when there are any – that are meant to maintain, strengthen and modernise services of State-owned enterprises are not enough."
"Without employees being involved in decisions and the destiny of the enterprise, without consulting the peoples and without a genuine code of practice which restricts multinationals involved in developing countries, recourse to private investments amounts to financial takeovers by large corporations, without there being any improvement to the service and often to the detriment of the national interests of these countries."
"The ever more dominant role of these transnational companies in the world clearly benefits the financial, speculative and stock market system more than the people of the South."
"I am, furthermore, surprised that the Commission is furthering privatisation as a means to fight corruption."
"In this regard, a great deal of experience in Europe and throughout the world far from verifies these assertions."
"The EU should strengthen its aid to the developing countries according to the criteria of whether enterprises are modernising by moving towards democratisation in decision-making processes, with more transparency in the operation of public service enterprises."
"Finally, and I will conclude on this point, the fundamental rights of every person to health and education must remain in the public sphere, just as water, transport, health and energy should remain outside of the GATS."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Modrow report is right to highlight a number of painful areas in the privatisation mania that has swept many developing countries."
"The nationalisation episode in the decolonisation era was followed by an episode of wild privatisations of undertakings, only for these often to become impoverished."
"Invariably, it was the political elite that pocketed the profits and placed these in foreign bank accounts during both eras."
"Invariably, too, Western multinationals acted as corrupted undertakings in order to lay their hands, for a song, on vital national industries such as mining and raw materials."
"When I visit Africa, I am often embarrassed on their behalf about their unethical behaviour, by the way, for example, in which the Zambian copper sector, with the closure of the mines, has dragged along with it an entire social fabric, an economic fabric which has shattered an entire country."
"I realise that the development of a country requires investments."
"However, can the European Union not play a more positive role so as to help create the conditions to ensure that the reforms in state-owned undertakings can progress in a more favourable sense for the sake of development?"
"I am not calling for dogmatism but for true partnership."
"A poor country is often not equal to the financial power of a multinational whose budget is many times greater than that of that country itself."
"If even we are not able to enforce the ethical codes of conduct for undertakings, how can we expect those poor countries to do so?"
"I join the rapporteur in calling for more attention and more resources to make the transition of small undertakings in the informal sector to the formal economy possible, and also for more resources for women, who are often active in this informal sector."
"They must have the first claim on aid, because their undertakings are probably the most direct way in which the fight against poverty in their country can be tackled."
"– Mr President, support for the development of industry in developing countries is intended to improve those countries' trading position."
"Consequently, the Commission's striving towards a predictable legal framework and a decrease in corruption receives my wholehearted support."
"With regard to the reform of state-owned undertakings, the Commission and the Modrow report are less convincing."
"First of all, the scope of both the Commission's policy framework and range of duties becomes too unwieldy."
"The Commission states that all other options must be examined before a developing country chooses to reform a state-owned undertaking."
"However, the Commission itself admits that the considerations to decide in favour of reform are political decisions."
"It is therefore unrealistic to make an objective consideration of the various options a requirement."
"Secondly, there is social policy."
"According to the Commission's communication and the rapporteur, the requirement of social measures must run parallel to reforms."
"This sounds charitable, but is inappropriate."
"After all, the European Community has no powers in the field of employment policy and social policy in the developing countries."
"These fall outside the remit of technical support and European development cooperation."
"Thirdly, in relation to the Member States' policies; there is hardly any reference in either the Commission communication or the Modrow report to the Member States' development cooperation in this field."
"The sustainable development relation between a developing country and a Member State could be the perfect framework in order to, for example, offer support in the event of redundancies."
"Finally, the relation between state-owned undertakings and poverty reduction; the Commission wishes to use poverty reduction as an assessment criterion for granting support to state-owned undertakings."
"This is not in keeping with its neutral position on private versus State ownership."
"The criterion should either apply just as much to private undertakings, or should not apply at all."
"In conclusion, support to undertakings in developing countries has my blessing, but the line of approach in the case of state-owned undertakings raises essential questions."
"– Mr President, this report is, in my view, a modest sign of a favourable development."
"One of the major problems in the developing world was – and still is to a great extent – the absence of a truly free market economy."
"In practice, socialistic and collectivistic experiments have generally exacerbated the problems rather than offered a solution to poverty."
"There appears to be a gradually growing consensus that governments alone will not bring universal happiness, and we have allowed free initiative to play a role."
"This is a positive development, and one that can only be applauded."
"As the report states, there are different ways of reforming state-owned undertakings."
"Nobody can be opposed to gradual change."
"We should only add a word of caution with regard to obstacles as a result of all kinds of intermediate levels of government intervention which people might try to incorporate."
"It is, at any rate, positive that there is a willingness to provide small- and medium-size companies a role, both and in the European Union."
"In my view, it is of the utmost importance for there to be a thorough and timely evaluation of the course of affairs, with no taboos, such as corruption, excessive bureaucracy, administrative inefficiency or even sheer incompetence."
"Moreover, this should not only apply to local governments, but also to NGOs and similar organisations, because, where dysfunction is concerned, these are only rarely called to task."
"Mr President, I wish to welcome the Communication from the Commission on the reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries."
"I wish, however, at the same time to regret the generally negative attitude to free enterprise and private ownership that emerges in the draft report."
"The high living standards and prosperity achieved by the western world, Japan and Australia are not the results of monopoly and protectionism but of the free market economy’s and private enterprise’s many dynamic forces that promote development and prosperity."
"In Europe, this state of affairs has been particularly clear."
"Half our continent has tried another method involving centralised control and large state monopolies."
"The inefficiency and collapse of monopoly socialism in Europe has been the experience of many European peoples and has provided them with a bitter lesson."
"It is a lesson that we ought, indeed have an obligation to, pass on to countries that wish to construct democratic welfare societies."
"The developing countries must be given the same opportunity to develop and create an economic model involving free competition and an open market economy."
"It is not the EU’s task to try to prevent a development towards competition that will bring prosperity in its wake."
"It is not too much in the way of a market economy that has been the big problem in the developing countries."
"On the contrary, the problem has been too little in the way of free economies and too much in the way of monopolies, something that has led to mismanagement, corruption and stagnation."
"I fully share the view concerning people’s need for clean water, efficient drainage, elementary health care and medical treatment, basic education and access to energy."
"It is not, however, the form of ownership in itself that is the most important thing, but a high degree of flexibility and efficiency in delivering these services."
"Competition is very important in this area."
"The developing countries naturally need regulations that provide a legal framework, and perhaps this is an area in which the EU can be of great help to the developing countries."
"Current political solutions in many developing countries are, unfortunately, often ineffective and expensive and only reach a limited proportion of the population."
"Those developing countries that have succeeded in taking the step from poverty to wealth and prosperity have all given priority to competition and efficiency, not centralised state control and the building of monopolies."
"Mr President, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Modrow for the pertinence of his report since the idea is clearly to subordinate everything to the fight against poverty."
"It must be said, however, that one of the two Commission Communications – the one entitled ‘reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries with focus on public utilities: the need to assess all the options’ – made for more than thought-provoking, but at the same time welcome, reading for me."
"Indeed, we read that numerous liberalisations and privatisations that were carried out quickly in developing countries, under the pressure of structural adjustment plans that are often imposed, have had disastrous consequences in terms of job losses and the deterioration, and increase in price, of the services concerned."
"We would like the Commission to show similar clarity and objectivity when dealing with services of general interest within the European Union itself."
"As is called for in the draft report, an initial step in this direction would be for the Commission to finally agree to carry out a transparent, public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment, on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in Europe."
"This would be just as beneficial internally as it would be in terms of better understanding the state of affairs in the southern countries."
"As I say, our objective is clearly to combat poverty and ensure that this is not just all talk."
"When we look more closely at the various examples quoted in the Communication, we can see that among the positive experiences are cases in which State-owned enterprises have remained State-owned but in which mismanagement and corruption have been combated, the enterprise has gained renewed dynamism and effectiveness in its management and, above all, a regulatory and political framework has been implemented, which has clear objectives that are ambitious in terms of development, accessibility and quality of service and that are, in particular, financed by tariff adjustment."
"These different elements do not amount to a commercialisation of the State-owned enterprise according to the Commission’s definition but, instead, constitute, in my view, factors for good management of public utilities, which we also need to establish at European level, perhaps through a framework directive."
"A final point is that those in favour of the general liberalisation of utilities though the GATS claim that opening up public utilities in developing countries can only benefit them."
"A more pragmatic analysis should favour a different economic development strategy: one that is centred on the local economic and social actors and small- and micro-enterprises – with account being taken, in particular, of women and basic public utilities – and one that, above all, does not hand such enterprises over to the reckless appetites of the multinationals."
"Excuse me at this point, however, for I think we are talking about ethics."
"Mr President, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, Mr Modrow, when talking about support for the development of the business sector in cooperation policies with third countries and, in particular, developing countries, it is perhaps useful to remember what the Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, stated in his book He said that one of the main obstacles to economic development, the missing ingredient, in countries that would in fact enjoy considerable wealth, is the absence of property laws that are clearly defined and, therefore, protected by the certainty needed to give them genuine economic value."
"It is therefore clear that the most valuable contribution that the European institutions can make – and I would say, in general, the most important contribution that developed countries can make – is to guarantee legal infrastructure that protects legal certainty and to support and guide processes towards democratisation and the recognition of the principles of the rule of law."
"The Commission document only briefly refers to this issue, which I consider to be key, and the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation does, I am sorry to say, drop this reference and concentrates on the tragic consequences of the policies promoted by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
"You see, I do not believe that it is right, even in such situations, to attribute liability to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for certain bankruptcies;"
"I am thinking about the Argentinian affair, where it is ever clearer that the failure, the decline of the State itself, is not to be attributed to the Monetary Fund or the World Bank but to the level of corruption and the level of statism present in that economy."
"It is said that we do not want to be ideological, but I fear that that is what we are in actual fact being."
"It is good to consider all the options; I believe, however, that the political option that we must propose is privatisation of enterprises with a view to seeking efficiency and investment."
"We want services to be available to the people, and to be available to an extent, and with a degree of quality, that satisfies needs that are not satisfied today."
"I believe that asking corrupt and inefficient public utilities to provide this service is wrong."
"The privatisation option – both in Europe and also in developing countries – is the politically desirable option."
"Mr President, in addition to analysing the EU’s policy to date, these communications are intended to lay the basis for the Commission’s strategies to promote enterprise in developing countries and to prepare the Commission’s position on the reform of State-owned enterprises."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the main focus must be on combating poverty and safeguarding the availability of basic services, and that the priority is support for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In recent decades Structural Adjustment Programmes have been used to try and respond to the call for economic development."
"These have involved the opening up of markets and various types of arrangements, including privatisation."
"This, however, has not always improved the situation; on the contrary, it has contributed substantially to the spread of poverty in developing countries."
"The Commission quite rightly states that that there are various options for reforming State-owned enterprises, such as reform of a public enterprise without altering its ownership structure, or partial privatisation."
"It is absolutely vital to take account of the parameters when selecting different types of reform."
"With privatisation, particular attention needs to be devoted to competition law and its implementation."
"The various options for reform must be weighed up, and here it is essential to involve civil society, particularly users’ and consumers’ organisations, cooperatives and trade unions, in decision-making and in monitoring the measures taken."
"At all events, the stated overriding objective of the EU’s development cooperation – combating poverty – must be taken into account."
"The Commission communication on the approach to future support for the development of the business sector in third countriesalso contains some good basic ideas."
"It is excellent that the Commission should put forward an overall strategy for the business sector."
"The basic aim of that strategy must simply be that there should be investment in the developing countries."
"People must be able to expect it."
"It cannot be based on the bottomless well principle."
"It is important to have tangible support for SMEs and cooperatives by means of advice in the fields of services, training, business modernisation, and promotion of micro-enterprises, particularly by ensuring there is available funding."
"It is nevertheless essential to remember that enterprises and cooperatives in the developing countries also need customers that are going to spend their money, and the market with the greatest purchasing power is us, the EU."
"For that reason, the channels of fair and sustainable trade must be made to work in such a way that European consumers are able to support enterprises and producers in developing countries by means of their own purchasing decisions."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."

"The next item is the Commission statement on Asian bird flu."
". Mr President, avian influenza has affected poultry populations in nine countries in Asia so far, namely Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, including the special administrative region of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam."
"According to an FAO-WHO-OIE expert panel held on 3 and 4 February in Rome, the current epidemic is still evolving and not yet under control."
"As of today, the disease has taken 18 human lives in Vietnam and Thailand, but a new virus, fully transmissible to humans and capable of spreading from human to human, has not yet emerged."
"In total Asia has around 40% of the world's poultry population and accounts for 25% of world trade in poultry."
"There are 6664 million birds in the affected areas."
"Already the situation is affecting the world's grain and meat markets."
"This is a devastating disease in poultry causing very high mortality – up to 95% in 24 hours."
"Many millions of birds have already died of the disease, or have been destroyed in the fight to halt its spread."
"In its sanitary and its economic dimension, not forgetting the animal welfare aspects, this outbreak of avian influenza is unprecedented and, although there is at present no indication of a developing human pandemic, this risk cannot be excluded according to the WHO."
"The disease impact is likely to be most felt by smallholders and owners of backyard flocks which form their main food supply."
"It may be more difficult to prevent the disease in these flocks than in larger commercial units."
"This has the potential to accelerate trends towards the industrialisation of poultry operations in the affected countries and therefore could have some negative social and environmental consequences."
"Clearly, the situation affects the European Community at many levels and the Commission, as well as the Member States, has taken decisive action."
"The Commission has immediately taken safeguard measures to ensure adequate protection against possible disease introduction in the territory of the Community via imports of live birds and poultry products from the countries concerned to protect both animal and public health."
"The Commission has made appropriate arrangements to send an animal health and two public health experts to Vietnam to assist in combating the disease in collaboration with the WHO."
"In addition, Member States have also sent experts to various other countries."
"We have been, and we will continue, monitoring the situation carefully via our delegations, the WHO, FAO, OIE, as well as governmental and other non-governmental information sources."
"The Member States have contingency plans in place according to Community legislation, approved by the Commission to be implemented in case of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry."
"The Commission services are at present scrutinising the plans submitted by acceding countries so that they can become operational on the date of accession."
"In the public health domain, assessment of risk to humans is carried out on a continuous basis in cooperation with the WHO and experts from the Member States."
"Rapid exchange of information and mutual consultation on guidelines and measures taken or planned by the Member States is ensured via the early-warning and response system of the European Community."
"Further measures and guidelines and consultation procedures could be taken by the Commission should the need arise."
"Moreover, the Commission intends to publish a working paper on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning, which sets out a series of steps to be taken by Member States and the European Community to address the threat of an avian influenza pandemic."
"The Commission is collaborating closely with the affected countries to identify areas where help is needed and where it can provide the greatest benefit."
"Not only the Directorate for Health and Consumer Protection, but also those for Development, EuropeAid and our Humanitarian Aid Office, are actively collaborating with local governments and non-governmental organisations."
"The EC delegations in the region are actively involved in this process and are coordinating with Member State embassies."
"Right now the Commission is preparing a major Community contribution to support Vietnam's efforts against avian influenza by the financing of up to EUR 1 million worth of protective and laboratory equipment under two ongoing EC assistance programmes under the auspices of DG EuropeAid."
"This will be the largest contribution to date by any donor to Vietnam."
"An agreement is due to be signed with the WHO, which should be finalised by the middle of this week."
"As time is an important factor, the Commission services at all levels are in continuous dialogue with the World Health Organisation, the FAO and World Organisation for Animal Health, and local authorities to share our experience and expertise in disease control as rapidly and with as little red tape as possible."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our staff for this extra effort."
"The Commission hopes that all these measures and activities will be successful in containing and ultimately eradicating the disease and that we can restore normal practices in our trade and other dealings with the countries affected sooner rather than later."
"The Commission will continue to follow the issue closely and support affected countries in collaboration and coordination with the relevant international organisations and the Member States, and it will adjust Community measures in proportion to the risks posed by the disease situation."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his remarks and I think we can all join him in hoping that what he has outlined will be successful."
"I would like to make three points."
"First, in relation to the European Union's own services, one imagines that those operating on our behalf in south-east Asia are mainly from the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin: our team of European Union health and food inspectors."
"Could the Commissioner tell the House how many people are involved in this work?"
"He briefly mentioned that."
"One of the things that worries the MEPs who have visited the Food and Veterinary Office is that it is very understaffed."
"In fact, I believe there are only 90 inspectors for the entire world."
"What worries me is that, if this pandemic in Asia is tying up a lot of the efforts of such inspectors, where is the work not being done?"
"One of the things we were talking about in the Committee recently was the importation of chicken meat from Brazil because of the danger that this was impregnated with nitrofurans."
"Now if we are looking at south-east Asia, can the Commissioner reassure me that somebody is still looking at what is happening in Brazil?"
"My second point is about the human health dimension, because although this obviously has an animal health issue at its starting point, the human health dimension is very important."
"Is Mr Byrne satisfied that the European Union already has the capacity to monitor effectively any signs that an animal epidemic, or a major human pandemic, has started to occur here, given the likelihood of concealment?"
"We have come across the element of concealment already in the countries where this has arisen."
"There is a temptation, I am sure, for concealment to happen elsewhere in the world also."
"Will he give some thought to setting up a rapid response team dedicated to planning for the worst in the European Union?"
"He has outlined something of this, but not perhaps talked about that precise team."
"The next report we are debating is very relevant – Mr Bowis' report on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"Unfortunately, that centre has not yet been set up. Would it be possible for an advance guard of the new Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to set up a planning team with which the European Parliament can have a dialogue?"
"Thirdly, Mr Byrne is also responsible for food safety at home and for legislation regarding food labelling."
"Given that we do not know exactly what the route of transmission is – if there is a route to humans – and that consumers are wary of food of unknown origin at such a time, would the Commission consider providing consumers with extra information via the labelling of the country of origin of the poultry meat component of composite foods which account for a very large section of the European Union market?"
"I note that Mr Byrne said that the Commission had banned the import of poultry meat and poultry products."
"Oh really?"
"Many consumers will tell you that it is impossible to tell where the poultry meat comes from in the composite foods we buy throughout the European Union."
"This is some of the information which I believe in this context should be given to the consumer."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Byrne, I am sure that the Commission has done its best;"
"I leave it to you to decide whether that, in a report, is always what we want to read."
"I also wonder whether what we do is always enough, and whether we really are thinking in terms of what is called preventative consumer protection."
"In saying this, Commissioner Byrne, it is not you alone that I have in mind, but all of us, as well as the governments and your fellow-Commissioners."
"I will come to that in a moment."
"As soon as we heard the first reports of avian influenza, we immediately stopped imports from Thailand into the European Union."
"Not much imagination would have been needed to announce on the same day that the whole of Asia would be sealed off, which would have been sensible."
"It is, perhaps, not very smart to use the domino approach by starting with Thailand and then moving on to Vietnam and then China."
"It would have made sense in view of what we know about how business is done in these countries and how birds and other animals, are traded and sold within them."
"What bothers me is the permanent state of -action."
"We are always -acting."
"Along comes avian influenza, we react to it, and then, for whatever reason, nothing happens for a long time."
"We discover that poultry meat contains dioxin – and we react."
"We discover the presence of prohibited, toxic, and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in shrimps and other products – and we react."
"We react, though, always and only on the spur of the moment, and promptly forget all about it."
"That is so naive, so boundlessly naive, for we know that the conditions under which animals are kept in the countries under discussion, and the standards of hygiene in Asian countries, but in Brazil as well, are dire in comparison with our own."
"As this is something we keep asking about in this House, I really would like to know what happens when the Commissioners discuss this around their table."
"When we ask Commissioner Lamy to give priority, in discussions on the World Trade Organisation, to consumer protection and hygiene policy as matters to be negotiated with third countries, I know that the most we can expect by way of response is a warm smile."
"We can content ourselves with that, but if we do not change our own system too, we will keep on ending up in situations like this one, of having to react to a pandemic which frightens our people and – I say this quite seriously – will of course have an effect on the economy."
"As Mrs Jackson said, most chicken mince ends up in burgers or in Chinese ready meals of one sort or another."
"People are unsettled; they will stop buying these products for a period of time, and that, to a large extent, will of course have an effect on our economy."
"The reasons for all this are very simple, and are to be found not only in the hygiene conditions, but also – and let me make this quite clear – in our having been too soft."
"As you will recall, Commissioner Byrne, I called upon you some time ago, when we were discussing dioxin and other products, to announce a ban on imports from China and other countries, simply for disciplinary or educational effect."
"Then we are always kind and say that these countries must have our support."
"That is a mistake."
"We will have something to say later on about the European Centre on Communicable Diseases."
"You made reference to serious steps, that is, to serious measures and courses of action;"
"I am sure they will all be marvellous, but only after a few years have passed."
"Right now, they are no use to us whatever; right now, the only thing that is any use is to announce that we will protect the people of the European Union, for it is for them that we are working in this House."
"Let us protect them!"
"Are we certain that the viruses that transmit avian influenza among birds and poultry cannot be passed on to human beings?"
"Have we done enough research?"
"That brings me to my next point, and – Mr President – it will be my last."
"When we are discussing the European Union’s Budget and the financial perspective, I always hear a lot said about regional policy, and a lot about aid policy and other matters."
"Do I even once hear anything said about how we are stringently requiring the Member States to ensure that enough research is being done into ways of protecting human beings from disease?"
"In that context, never; nor is it one of the European Union’s priorities."
"I would be grateful to you, Commissioner Byrne, if you could ensure that the financial perspective will include, as one of its priorities, an obligation on the Member States to spend money on research into vaccines capable of protecting people against the diseases that may come our way in the future."
"– Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner for the statement he has made."
"Whilst he, the past few years, has become well-versed in the field of epidemics and animal diseases, the big question is: What have we learnt from them?"
"One of the Commission's most important conclusions with regard to the fight against FMD was that the external borders have to be protected."
"What has been done about this conclusion?"
"When I enter, let us say, Amsterdam or Dublin, I can still see a major difference in comparison with, to take one example, the United States of America."
"In my view, control procedures have hardly changed over the past few years."
"I could be wrong, but I should like to hear from the Commissioner what specific measures have been taken."
"Why is it that I read in the paper that at Schiphol in Amsterdam, disinfectant mats have been put in place, while this is not being done anywhere else in Europe?"
"Why is it that entirely different measures are being taken in Belgium?"
"What official recommendations does the Commission give the Member States and how is this advice being acted upon?"
"Imports from Thailand and other countries have been suspended."
"This weekend, there were rumours in the Dutch press that chicken meat from those countries would enter the European Union after all via a side entrance, namely via the new acceding countries."
"Is this true or not?"
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already spoken about the need for further research, vaccines and testing methods, among other things. The point is that this Parliament has given the Commission the opportunity of using this extra money twice in the past two years."
"I am not talking about the resources in Category 3 for research, but extra resources in Category 1a of the agricultural budget."
"The Commission has chosen not to spend them."
"Why not, despite the fact that the self-same Commissioner has declared in this plenary that that would be the case?"
"The Commission has failed to meet a request from the budgetary authority, and I should like to know why that is?"
"Crisis management: the Commission has already stated that there is an emergency plan."
"I gather that there are indeed certain plans afoot, but what is the situation as regards human health?"
"The flu medicine that could help the public is now available to a limited extent."
"Has the Commission consulted the Member States on how it will be used in the different countries if there are inadequate supplies of this medicine in certain other countries?"
"Finally, a word about the OIE."
"Trade depends on trust and many aspects cannot be monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin alone, which is dependent on the information that countries pass on to the OIE."
"It has now transpired that Indonesia, Vietnam and possibly China, have probably waited many months before informing the OIE."
"What does the Commission intend to do in this context in order to enhance the provision of information, and to ensure that trading can take place under fair conditions, with no risk of our suddenly being faced with illegal imports of products of this kind?"
"– Mr President, I am quite happy to agree with the Commissioner that his staff deserve thanks."
"You said, Commissioner, that work is being done right now, on the ground, to combat the epidemic."
"Good though that is, were you on the spot straightaway when the epidemic started?"
"Were you informed of it then, or only later on when the press picked up the story, and when there was general uproar among us?"
"You said, Commissioner, that small businesses have been affected, and that this could provide the impetus for industrialisation."
"I take the view that it is precisely the moves towards industrialisation that have taken place in these countries that have created the conditions for this pandemic, for they have brought indigenous and adapted breeds into contact with genetically developed breeds that may have adapted to industrialisation but have genetic defects and lack resistance to this disease."
"So, if you favour on-the-spot controls in this case, as we do, they must form part of a constant analytical process if these problems are to be addressed."
"It is not the small-time poultry farmers who export to the European Union, but the large industrial plants, and their standards of hygiene must be equal to our own."
"That will not, however, be achieved by having controls at borders or by tightening up the ones that are already in place – and always in a visible way, as the sort of reaction that Mrs Roth-Behrendt described; what we need instead is special external protection."
"What this means is that prevention does not start at the border; rather, we must impose our standards, and monitor adherence to them, in the countries that supply us, enabling us to guarantee preventative observation and action to reorient production in these countries."
"Thank you very much."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to us that the current epizootic disease of avian influenza in Thailand and South-East Asia again raises acutely the question of these new pandemics, with the risks of repeated health crises, as we have seen in the recent past, which have destabilised farmers and also threatened consumers."
"We are told today that the whole of South-East Asia is affected, with 19 human victims – 14 in Vietnam and five in Thailand – and 50 million birds slaughtered on the Asian continent."
"One case has been reported in the United States."
"We would like to know, Commissioner, what is the likelihood of contamination and to what extent it is possible to say that the virus that has appeared in the US is or is not the same one as has appeared in Asia."
"I would like to mention a number of precedents: bovine spongiform encephalitis, to which my colleague Mr Martinez repeatedly tried to draw the Commission’s attention over five years before it burst upon the world in the shape of the famous mad cow affair; foot and mouth disease in the UK and dioxin-contaminated chicken in Belgium."
"Last year there were cases of avian influenza in the Netherlands, not to mention the swine fever that recurs in our countries."
"I am glad that we have understood the full extent of the problem right away this time."
"As my fellow Members have said, however, we also need to deal with the causes."
"While the causes of these diseases are sometimes concealed to avoid damaging the industry or turning away the consumer, we do – at least in the previous cases – have a pretty good idea what they are."
"We know it was mainly the quest for high yields and high-density farming on the one hand, as the previous speaker said, and, on the other, generalised free trade and the systematic opening of borders."
"This theory, which used to be stigmatised as the ‘free fox in the free henhouse’, fits the situation perfectly, the fox here rather symbolising free trade."
"Not only has it eaten the chicken but, what is far worse, it has contaminated it."
"True, the Commission has proposed an embargo on imports of Thai chicken until August 2004, but that seems to us inadequate given the scale the phenomenon is assuming."
"Remember, Commissioner, that the Commission hauled France before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg for refusing to lift the embargo on British beef when there was no guarantee that the British meat was harmless and BSE was still wreaking havoc in the United Kingdom and Ireland."
"France, which produces 2 million tonnes of poultry a year, 35 to 45% of it for export, could return for a time – and not only France but others too – to traditional markets from which it was ousted by competition from Brazil, which practices dumping prices and where, it also appears, production conditions are atrocious."
"So much so, incidentally, that Europe’s number one poultry producer, Doux, has relocated to Brazil to take advantage of cheap labour and plentiful raw materials at low prices."
"Systematic free trade not only destabilises our producers and our poultry farmers, it also forces us, as part of the WTO, to accept ridiculous clauses that make you wonder what they have got to do with a free economy and a free market."
"I am thinking of the one that was signed at the GATT in 1994 stipulating that Europe commits itself to importing 5% of its poultry meat consumption, or one million tonnes in 2002."
"For the present there has been no transmission of avian influenza between humans, but if there is a risk of a world pandemic and if the H5N1 virus were to combine with a human virus like the flu virus to create a new, highly contagious fatal strain, then I think, Commissioner, that the EUR 1 million credit you have just announced could prove tragically inadequate."
"Commissioner Byrne, thank you for the explanation, which can almost be seen as an extremely accurate description of the situation."
"My speech is, I am sorry to say, based on press information, information which – at least as regards Italy – is awakening considerable concerns since, for example, dead peregrine falcons and migratory ducks, two species of a very resistant nature, have been discovered."
"I would now like to make two simple and precise comments."
"The first concerns the health aspect."
"We are not being caught completely unawares by the H5N1 strain, because it was identified back in 1997 and it reappeared as H7N1 between 1999 and 2001."
"Now, because the strain is continually mutating, we would ask the Commission what it intends to do as regards prevention, because – as some Members rightly stated before me – we always spring into action after the emergency arises."
"Some Member States are equipped with their own national laboratories, but the European Centre for Infectious Diseases must set up a group to monitor the ways in which the health situation is monitored in the Member States."
"The second aspect concerns the Commission’s work."
"As Commissioner Lamy announced, there is an extremely serious option, within the talks to revive the WTO, aimed at increasing the number of countries involved in the EBA initiative."
"So then, what are the guarantees offered to our consumers as regards the globalisation of markets?"
"Does the Commission not believe that, on this subject, a think-tank should be set up, within the actual context of the WTO, concerning the relationship between globalisation and health problems?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, once again we face a new public health threat."
"This illness shows that communicable diseases go beyond the framework of the Member States and impose the need for immediate measures which guarantee prevention and protect the health of European citizens."
"On 1 February 2004, the World Health Organisation pointed out the danger of the flu virus spreading from human to human."
"So far 19 people have died, 23 have been contaminated and the virus has emerged in ten Asian countries."
"Not only is the virus highly communicable, but the delay yet again in providing the relevant information has helped it to spread."
"The European Commission perhaps underestimated the danger, considering that the virus cannot be transmitted from human to human."
"However, we know that flu viruses are genetically unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted."
"So this specific epidemic may change quickly and continually."
"Without question, I welcome the measures taken to ban imports of meat and poultry for six months and imports of live birds as domestic animals from Asian countries."
"But we must not stop at that, Commissioner."
"As you well know, the virus is also carried by wild birds as their flocks move."
"We need the expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, so that suitable guidelines can be issued and the importance of preventive vaccination, where possible, can be highlighted."
"History has taught us that, in cases where a disease has economic repercussions on the agricultural sector and may also harm human health, the risk to man must not be underestimated; it must take priority if we really want to maintain consumer confidence."
"I do not feel that this is what has happened so far with the measures announced."
"Finally, Commissioner, we must be certain that livestock breeders in the areas affected are in a position to obtain suitable means to incinerate animals attacked by the disease without any risk of its spreading."
"– Commissioner Byrne, thank you for your factual explanation, but still, I have to say that I wonder what it is we are actually doing exactly."
"Indeed, like the Liberals, we cannot fail to observe that we do not only have one external border, but fifteen different external borders where assorted attempts are being made at controlling the possible import of avian influenza."
"We have witnessed a similar scenario in the case of FMD, and we must take measures in order to prevent a similar situation from occurring again."
"I need to get something else off my chest."
"If our elderly are at risk of contracting flu, vaccines are available on a massive scale."
"In this case too, we know that vaccines are necessary, but nothing, or far too little, is being done about it."
"The only country that is working on vaccines is Italy."
"I think that the European Union should make a concerted effort to develop vaccines so that we can combat this disease in a humane manner."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was almost a year ago exactly that this House discussed SARS."
"Now, as then, many Members are saying that globalisation and the European internal market, which are essentially good things, can work well only if we also take action to protect people’s health."
"This is where Europe needs to take joint action, for viruses and bacteria do not, after all, stop at borders."
"Let me pick up Mr Mulder’s example."
"Düsseldorf’s airport is very, very close to the Dutch border, and so it is from Düsseldorf that many Dutch people fly when they go on holiday, and a lot of people from the part of North Rhine-Westphalia around Düsseldorf fly from Schiphol."
"People will not understand why safety measures at Schiphol have to be quite different from those in Düsseldorf."
"In any case, viruses do not make a stop at the borders, which are themselves established in different ways by nation-states, and so I believe this is where we need more measures taken at European level."
"A year ago, I backed Commissioner Byrne when he was trying to get more competences to combat this sort of threat included in the European constitution."
"Admittedly, he does often overshoot the mark, and when he did, I told him so, but, in this case, he really is right, and we should be behind him."
"Although the Convention did not achieve what we actually wanted, progress has been made, and that is another reason to press for a European constitution, which will better enable us to combat these dangers."
"I would like to conclude by taking up Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s point about research."
"We do indeed have to do more for medical research, and when we do, we must not think only in terms of products that are capable of being used in the short term."
"The protection of people’s health is a research objective too, one that it is worth pushing, one on which it is worth spending money if there are no firms willing to do it in the short term."
"Dangers can present themselves without warning, and so we have to be prepared, even if industry has made no effort by the time the danger arises."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I welcome your statement here this morning, but I understand that you went to Thailand and were told that it was not avian flu but chicken cholera."
"It was only when you returned that you later found that it was actually avian flu."
"I welcome the ban you have imposed on Thai chicken meat but you have not banned cooked meat or canned meat, and this accounts for about 75% of our imports from Thailand."
"The Thai authorities have been found wanting in international compliance."
"They have hidden the Thai flu for maybe two months."
"If they protect their market from a deadly disease, surely they will protect it against minor infringements of EU standards."
"Will they run the same risk with cooked meats?"
"Will we see nitrofuran residues and hormones entering the EU in this cooked meat?"
"Is the public health of the EU overridden by the trade interests of EU exporters?"
"I believe Thailand should be completely delisted from all poultry meat exports until that country can prove it has the infrastructure and the integrity to apply EU standards all the time."
"Can we also have a labelling of country of origin for principal ingredients in processed food, because this is where most of this Thai cooked meat comes in?"
"How can we be sure that meat cooked in Thailand has reached the correct temperature?"
"There is perhaps a slight risk – how do we know?"
"Cooked chicken may come into the UK frozen, then thaw and be eaten with no further treatment from the time the Thais cooked it."
"Is this a risk to our consumers?"
"The tariff for Thai cooked chicken meat is one seventh of that on frozen fresh chicken."
"Why is this so, Commissioner?"
"This seems to be a loophole."
"Finally, has the disease moved to the United States of America?"
"– Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for his introduction."
"There are actually only a few questions of importance not only to the consumer, but also to the sector itself."
"The very first question we have to ask is whether Europe finally determined what it is that we do not want to let in."
"I sometimes feel sorry for the Commissioner, because he can only implement what has been agreed in the Member States."
"The order did not become valid until 6 February."
"This means that the system governing the Commission’s relations with the Member States – after all, you cannot always do everything – probably still leaves something to be desired."
"Moreover, I wonder what the situation is as regards meat, because the order stipulates 1 January as the date on which imports are no longer permitted."
"What about meat that has been imported from those countries prior to that date?"
"My next question is as follows."
"I gather that there is now also a problem in the United States."
"Admittedly, it is not the real avian influenza as we know it in Asia, but it appears to be related."
"What do we do with those countries?"
"What do the consumers want?"
"They want the guarantee that they receive safe products."
"They also want sound information, which states that, since you normally do not eat raw meat, chicken meat in a different composition or other method of preparation can do no harm."
"Let us make sure we can provide this collective information."
"A number of Members have already mentioned vaccines."
"I see this as an area in which Europe should develop far more resources and scope in order to act as one."
"Mr President, Northern Ireland has a very vibrant poultry industry, which is expressing grave concern."
"While what has happened in Asia is unfortunate, we have to protect the European market, because it is an extremely large market for the poultry industry."
"I am concerned about the length of time it took the authorities in Asia to notify us of the outbreak."
"This is a very worrying aspect."
"I have to ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the depth of our scrutiny of the chicken Asia is producing and exporting to Europe."
"There is cause for grave concern."
"Our producers produce chicken and broiler chicken meat of an extremely high standard for the consumers in Europe."
"But the standard of chicken, not only from the Far East but also from other parts of the world, is seriously questionable."
"We can sit back on our laurels and wait and see."
"Before this ban is lifted again, Commissioner, I would like your assurance that you will do everything to ensure that our veterinary inspection in the Far East where the outbreaks took place is of the highest quality, and we accept no excuses."
"I would also raise the point of the import of chicken feathers."
"This might not look like a problem, but I am told that it is the most serious way of exporting Asian bird flu to Europe."
"You have to take that on board too when you deal with the chicken meat."
"– Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation, but there is a Dutch proverb that says: wherever an ass falls, there he will never fall again, or, in other words, ‘once bitten, twice shy’."
"It is certainly not my intention to draw a comparison between our Commissioner and that animal, but it is absolutely true that the Commission is often late in responding to certain epidemics of animal diseases."
"We saw this in the case of FMD and we are witnessing it again now."
"The Commissioner visited Thailand in early January and stated there, during his visit, that he was pleased about how the problem was being dealt with and that there was certainly no risk of avian influenza."
"Meanwhile, one month on, we are in the middle of a worldwide crisis."
"We in the CDA delegation in this House demand from the Commissioner that the line of approach similar to the one we have in the Netherlands, the so-called Veerman approach, should be extended Europe-wide: a ban on the imports of all poultry, so including cooked meat, from South-East Asia, a ban on the imports of ornamental birds, tighter control on flights from Asia and disinfectant mats on all international airports with direct or indirect connections to Asia."
"That is at the moment the only way of warding off this crisis."
"In addition, I should like the Commissioner to shed light on the rumour that FMD has broken out in 26 towns in Vietnam."
"We can now fight the problem in good time and, if that is the case, we can ensure that, this time round, adequate measures are taken and we should not wait until the disaster has spread in South-East Asia again before we take action."
"We are in favour of supporting the Asian countries in the fight against avian influenza, but we in Europe should not be injecting funds into this while a number of countries ride roughshod over the quarantine measures."
"Finally, the Commission should start a worldwide debate on the fight against animal diseases."
"Similarly, preventive vaccination should gradually become a subject of discussion worldwide, from the point of view of both public and animal health."
"Mr President, I welcome our Commissioner, Mr Byrne."
"I am deeply concerned about some of the issues that have been raised in this meeting today."
"Is this a matter of public health or public safety, or is it just a trade issue?"
"I strongly believe that this is a matter of public health."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner how long it took him to decide to ban chicken from coming into the European Union?"
"Is chicken that is still in transit coming into the European Union, or has that also been stopped?"
"We heard from Mr Parish that there is a problem of cooked and chilled meats coming in."
"Why has it not been decided to ban all meats coming in?"
"It is said that the flu virus is killed at 70 degrees – given an absolutely perfect situation – but we do not know how these products are cooked."
"Can you, Commissioner, guarantee the safety of children in my constituency?"
"For example, schools in Bedford are using Thai chicken to prepare meals for the pupils."
"Can we totally guarantee their safety?"
"I have three direct questions for you, Commissioner."
"What are you doing to ensure the safety of meat coming into this country?"
"How many qualified inspectors do we have today on our borders, checking the safety and quality of products coming into the European Union?"
"You were asked what you were going to do about labelling."
"Can we guarantee the consumer that labelling will show the country of origin of production?"
"It is particularly important that you look at this, Commissioner."
"This is not just about trade, it is about health."
"Mr Nicholson mentioned feathers."
"Have you stopped the import of feathers as of today?"
"Mr President, we are all mindful of the impact on the world’s population of the atypical pneumonia that raged for much of last year."
"The ongoing helplessness of the specialists in the face of this epidemic led to a further sense of insecurity and resulted in a high number of casualties and also a climate of instability in society because it emphasised the deadly risk to anyone contracting the disease."
"Because I believe that life and health are the most precious assets we have, I must express my concern at this new epidemic: a form of flu whose virus comes from chickens and for which no cure has yet been found."
"According to studies published recently by the scientific community, only one thing is certain: this disease is highly contagious."
"What can be done to counter it?"
"Use vaccines?"
"How effective are they?"
"Draw boundaries around neighbourhoods, cities and countries and cut them off from the outside world?"
"This is what happened 80 years ago and we all know what the outcome was."
"How safe are imports of this meat across the world?"
"We all need more complete information at least so that the population at large is not gripped by panic."
"We have a duty to ensure that our actions contribute to making health policies accountable, as regards this new disease too, in the face of which we feel powerless."
"We must find out whether other animals in our food chain are equally at risk, because a few days ago pigs were said to be amongst the animals most vulnerable to this type of virus."
"To allay these legitimate concerns, all the necessary means must be made available to prevent and treat this epidemic."
"Mr President, the European Union must raise concerns about the unhealthy practices that have developed alongside the industrialisation and mass transportation of livestock in parts of Asia."
"Animal disease now travels far and fast in types of farming and food distribution."
"That makes it very difficult to control."
"In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw materials where they are cheapest, and the European poultry industry has struggled to compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil, where labour costs are very much lower."
"The UK alone imported 36 649 tonnes of poultry meat from Thailand in the first ten months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year."
"But in the light of this flu virus we must maintain the strictest food safety standards here in the European Union, ensuring that all imports meet those very same high standards."
"Modern food systems mean that animal diseases travel far and travel quickly."
"The outbreak of avian flu in the Netherlands last year illustrated how hard the disease can be to contain."
"Does the Commission believe that all health authorities in the European Union would spot avian flu and be able to react decisively enough if it arrived on this continent?"
". Mr President, I have been asked a number of questions and I will endeavour to answer as many as possible."
"First, Mrs Jackson asks whether I am satisfied with the inspection services that we have, particularly in relation to our work in Asia."
"In relation to the FVO, I should say that I have not sent the FVO to Thailand in respect of this particular outbreak."
"The experts who are there, who have been offered by me, have been supplying their services through the World Health Organisation and are in place working with the OIE , in Vietnam particularly."
"The FVO will be involved in this exercise only when it is believed there is something profitable to be gained from it, that is in circumstances where there is the possibility of lifting the ban."
"I have made it clear on a number of occasions publicly that it is not my intention to lift this ban on the importation of Thai chicken until such time as there is an independent evaluation of the situation there, in view of the history that a number of you have referred to."
"The evaluation will be made as a result of a visit from the inspectors of the FVO and following a report from them as to the situation."
"Mrs Jackson also asked me whether, in view of the likelihood of concealment, we are getting good information and whether we have a proper rapid response team in place."
"As I indicated in my earlier remarks, there is in existence an early warning response system."
"This system is in place, working from Luxembourg, and has been in operation for some time."
"You will remember when I reported to Parliament last year on the SARS issue, I also pointed to the work of this committee."
"There is a Communicable Diseases Network which also works in conjunction with the relevant authorities in the Member States."
"I am absolutely satisfied that the system of rapid response that we have in relation to animal and human diseases is very effective."
"You will remember the very quick response of the Commission and my services to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease some years ago, when the Commission responded within a matter of hours and all the relevant authorities and Member States knew within a matter of hours that there had been this outbreak in the United Kingdom."
"The same is true of public health because we have this system in place."
"Mention was also made of the next item on Parliament's agenda: the legislation establishing the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"I can assure Parliament that the evidence is there that the Commission and other institutions of the European Union are working well to respond quickly to these kinds of issues and to give proper information to the public and, indeed, to respond well and appropriately to outbreaks of this kind."
"On the question of food labelling, there is Community law in place relating to labelling."
"It may need upgrading and I am looking at that."
"The legislation in place requires country of origin labelling and certification and stamps from countries such as Thailand."
"So, if cooked chicken from Thailand comes pre-packed it has a stamp on it which indicates that and the label also states the country of origin which, as I indicated in this case, is Thailand."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me if we are doing enough in respect of avian flu and, in particular, blocking food products from Asia."
"It is important to emphasise that we do not trade in any poultry products with any country in Asia other than Thailand, so the responses given relate to that country."
"Of course we are concerned about the outbreak of animal and bird diseases in other parts of the world and we make sure that we respond properly to those issues."
"As a number of people mentioned during this debate, we must not lose sight of the fact that we have had these outbreaks of avian influenza in the European Union also."
"We had an outbreak in Italy two or three years ago; we had an outbreak in the Netherlands last year; there have been outbreaks in Belgium and Germany too."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt also asked me what I am doing about imports from China."
"It is public knowledge that we banned imports from China some years ago; there was a lot of publicity about that at the time."
"There are a number of food products we do not import from China, including poultry."
"On the question of research into vaccinations, this is being done – DG Research does have a research programme on food safety."
"On this same subject which Mrs Roth-Behrendt and others referred to, an informal meeting of the health ministers of the EU and accession countries will be taking place in Brussels on Thursday evening."
"One of the items on the agenda is the question of the stockpiling of vaccines in respect of diseases of this kind, of which flu is obviously one."
"We had a discussion in Parliament last year on appropriate responses to the bioterrorism issue, such as stockpiling vaccines against smallpox."
"There is ongoing work in relation to that also."
"However, I must emphasise, as Mr Liese has said, that the competences available to us at European Union level in respect of public health issues are quite limited."
"An attempt was made to extend these competences in the European Convention and we made some progress."
"I still have hopes that we might ultimately make more progress on this before the finalisation of the Constitution."
"Mr Mulder asked me about the inspection systems."
"In his opinion inspections are not carried out at the same level for products coming in from outside the European Union."
"Under Commission Decision 2002/995/EC, all personal imports of meat in the luggage of passengers from Asia have been banned with the exception of small amounts of specialist food products, such as baby food."
"Under these rules, poultry meat and meat products carried by passengers cannot be introduced into the EU without conforming to the same health requirements as commercial imports."
"As I said earlier, no commercial imports of poultry meat are allowed from any Asian country where the disease is present."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf then asked me whether I reacted quickly or only when the press publicised this issue."
"As has been indicated by a number of other speakers, I was in Asia when this outbreak became public."
"I had been in Vietnam, from where we do not import any poultry meat, so the issue does not arise there."
"But I had also been in Thailand."
"It is public knowledge that in the early part of the week when I was there, there was some lack of transparency, if could express it in that way."
"I was concerned during the couple of days I was there at the mounting circumstantial evidence tending in the other direction."
"Following pressing questions from me, it was made clear to me two or three days later that in fact avian flu was present, both in the human and bird populations."
"I am satisfied that my presence in Thailand helped to improve transparency in relation to this issue."
"As soon as the presence of avian flu was confirmed to me on 23 January, I put a ban in place within a matter of hours."
"The ban went in place on that Friday at 12 o'clock, Brussels time."
"Any suggestion that the Commission reacted slowly is incorrect."
"I cannot imagine any greater degree of surveillance or monitoring than the Commissioner being there himself, asking questions, not being satisfied with the answers, pressing further, getting the truth and acting within hours."
"Mr Gollnisch asked me about the risk of contamination of the United States virus."
"It is believed, but not yet confirmed, that this virus is a low pathogenic virus and therefore would not require the same degree of response as for the Asian influenza from Thailand."
"However, that is not confirmed, we are still looking at it and our response will depend on our information."
"I assure him that the lifting of the ban will only take place after independent evaluation of the circumstances."
"Mr Fiori asked me about pet birds and other birds."
"A ban has been put in place in respect of the importation of pet birds."
"He asked me about coordinating groups."
"There is a regulatory committee of the EU, which includes Member States' experts, who deal with that."
"He asked me about links between globalisation and diseases."
"The OIE in Paris continues evaluating the situation."
"The Commission is a member of that, Member States are involved."
"They are meeting later this month in relation to this issue."
"The SPS Agreement is also a relevant contributor to the protection of animal and public health in relation to the WTO issues."
"Mr de Roo asked me about borders."
"Once again, I refer back to the lack of competences that we have in relation to borders and communicable diseases, but I hope more progress will be made on this."
"I refer him also to my earlier answer that the health ministers are meeting later this week to deal with many of the issues that he raised about the public health aspect and in particular vaccinations."
"Mr Parish said that it was only when I returned that I discovered there was a problem and that I reacted well."
"As I indicated earlier, that was not the case;"
"I reacted while I was there and the Commission responded well to this issue."
"We have not banned cooked meats for the reasons that have been stated."
"I am advised that cooked meats above 60 degrees – and we put in a safety margin of another 10 degrees – are safe for human consumption."
"The inspectors in the European Union, and in the Member States themselves, know what is necessary and carry out appropriate inspections to ensure that there are no breaches of Community law in relation to this issue."
"He also referred to labelling and I refer him to my earlier answer."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked me whether we followed the Member States' lead in this."
"The actual chronology of events is that on 23 January the Commission put in place the ban in circumstances I have already outlined;"
"Member States responded with the regulatory committee confirming that ban on 6 February; and a further ban was put in place in respect of feathers – Mr Nicholson asked me about that – on 28 January."
"Mr Sturdy asked me how long it took for the ban to be put in place."
"I have already answered that question."
"There were a number of questions in relation to the number of inspectors at the border posts."
"This is a Member State competence."
"The Member States themselves make sure that they have enough officials to ensure that the importation is properly inspected."
"The Food and Veterinary Office inspectors monitor this when they carry out their inspections."
"They report, and the reports are public."
"There are no reports of any concerns in relation to this."
"On labelling, I refer you to my earlier answer."
"Concerning feathers, again I refer you to my earlier answer: that ban has been in place since 28 January."
"Mrs Cardoso made reference to the vulnerability of pigs and I would confirm that this is a concern and is being watched very closely."
"There have been reports of some infection found in the noses of some pigs in Vietnam, but it has not extended any further and there has been no evidence of mutation of the flu virus."
"This is, however, being watched very closely because of the similarity between the immune system of pigs and of humans."
"Therefore, as she rightly points out, it is of considerable concern."
"Mr Wyn asked me whether the health authorities are doing everything that they can to stop the spread of this disease."
"I am impressed by the work undertaken by my own staff."
"I have had detailed consultations and briefings and I am satisfied that their own work, their interaction with the WHO, the FAO and the OIE, and also their interaction with the experts in the Member States, indicate to me that this issue is being taken very seriously, that the officials, at both national and international level, understand the seriousness of this and that they are doing everything in their power to ensure that the disease is not spread."
"One of the difficulties being faced in some poorer areas is that the stamping-out of the disease is best achieved by killing the birds in question."
"This is of course a matter of concern in poor countries, because unless the authorities involved face up to the question of compensation there is a risk that a disease of this kind may be hidden."
"That may be a contributing factor to the earlier lack of full transparency about this issue in that part of the world."
"This has to be faced and we have to emphasise it in our relations with the authorities in Member States."
"These kinds of diseases cannot be hidden, their presence will come out, will be known, and the consequences ultimately will be worse for those countries who engage in that exercise, because they undermine the confidence of the authorities engaged in food safety, like ours in the European Union."
"The stringent measures necessary before the ban is lifted in Thailand, with the requirement that there will be independent evaluation, will be particularly necessary in this instance because of the lack of transparency at an earlier stage."
"We must be assured that our own authorities are satisfied, which is why no lifting of the ban in Thailand will take place until the FVO has carried out an inspection on the ground and reported back that things are satisfactory."
"– Mr President, on a point of order, I have asked the Commissioner about the rumour of the FMD outbreak in 26 towns in Vietnam that are also plagued by avian influenza."
"I have not had an answer to this question from the Commissioner."
"I should like to know whether the Commissioner has any information on this."
". Mr President, we are watching the situation in Vietnam very carefully and in particular the spread of this disease there."
"There may be a risk that the outbreak of the disease there is more serious and more widespread than in Thailand."
"I believe that to be the case."
"I must emphasise that we do not import any poultry from Vietnam, so there is no risk to public health."
"There is no risk to animal health from direct importation from Vietnam and therefore our concern in this relates to ensuring the containment of the spread of the disease in Asia itself as a matter of general interest, but it is not related to any further risk as a result of any importation of birds, because we do not engage in that kind of trade with Vietnam."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has been very elaborate in his answer, but he has avoided answering one essential question."
"Under heading 1a in the 2003 and 2004 budgets this Parliament and the Council have twice provided for extra funds to be set aside for research into better vaccines and testing methods."
"The Commission was at liberty to decline that wish of Parliament."
"In the light of present developments, is the Commission prepared to investigate the possibility of using funds from heading 1a for research into vaccines and testing methods and inform this House as soon as possible of the outcome of these deliberations?"
"It is urgent that we do something, and the Commission should not ignore the resolutions of this Parliament in this respect, nor the budget itself."
". I know that Mr Mulder is interested in this matter and that he has had direct contact with my cabinet about it as recently as in the last few days."
"The items he mentions as requiring financing are being financed."
"The question is: under what heading will they be dealt with?"
"If it is believed to be necessary to transfer from one budget heading to another and that this is the best way of dealing with it, then this can be done."
"This matter is under review."
"However, it is important to emphasise that the items he mentions as requiring financing are not being under-financed."
"They are being financed."
"Whatever refinement may be necessary in the future can be dealt with at that time."
"– Mr President, I do not want to respond to what the Commissioner has said here, but simply to know when the minutes of yesterday’s sitting will be adopted since I know they are not yet available."
"Will it be at the start of this afternoon’s sitting or at some other time?"
"– It will be at the start of this afternoon’s sitting, at 3 p.m."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0038/2004) by Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
". I am pleased to be here to discuss the Commission’s proposal for a regulation to establish a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in August 2003."
"Allow me first to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work and support on this important and urgent proposal."
"The SARS emergency in the early spring of 2003 served as a sharp reminder of the need to accelerate the further development of our capacity to deal with health threats."
"The current epidemic of avian influenza in Asia – that we have just discussed – with its potential risk to public health, reinforces the need for prompt and effective action."
"The existing Community network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases is a solid basis on which we can build – to enhance cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and international organisations, in particular the World Health Organisation."
"We need to have the means at our disposal to respond to emerging health threats based on the best scientific advice, in the shortest possible time."
"Establishment of the centre marks the shift from ad hoc cooperation to structured coordination through a focal point, giving clear scientific leadership."
"In some recent cases, in response to WHO requests for help, we have seen teams from different Member States investigating the same phenomena with slightly different methodologies, sending samples to different laboratories, with each of them reporting separately."
"This divergence would end with the creation of a scientifically reputable centre with the authority to act at Community level on matters such as surveillance, networking of expert laboratories or mobilising outbreak investigation teams."
"The Commission’s text takes into account budgetary rigour and respects the Member States’ responsibilities on public health."
"At first, the centre's core task will be to deal with communicable diseases from whatever source – deliberate or adventitious."
"The question of extending its mandate subsequently should be addressed on the basis of experience."
"I very much hope that we can reach a speedy agreement between the institutions – during first reading – to enable the centre to become operational as soon as possible."
". Mr President, when I present reports to this Parliament I like to add by way of a signature a quotation and in this case I have used the Arabian proverb: 'He who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything'."
"The statement and the debate we have just been listening to show the hopes and the fears of our constituents and their concern that we do better in this area in the future."
"In the case of avian flu, with the transmission from hens to ducks to pigs to humans – resulting in the deaths of 19 humans – mutation is a possibility."
"When we look back at the SARS experience and when we look around at the constant threat of bioterrorism, we see the need for this centre to coordinate better, as the Commissioner has said, and we see the need for urgency in bringing this measure forward."
"We are dealing with health emergencies that are within the competence of the European Union."
"We are also dealing with other health areas and starting, as the Commissioner has said, with communicable diseases, not least those with drug-resistant strains, which threaten our communities."
"This report provides for a later review in three years' time, which will look at the scope of the measure and the experience gained and see how best we can move forward in terms of other health monitoring."
"The centre does not resemble the American Central Direction Center, but is rather a network of networks."
"It is neither bureaucratic, nor is it costly."
"In due course, we may need to look at its costs to see if we are adequately funding it, but for now it is certainly not costly."
"It will work closely with national networks and no national network need feel threatened by this because they will fully be a part of it."
"It will also work with international agencies, particularly the WHO, which is so fundamental in these areas."
"In our discussions we have had two key issues before us."
"One was the scope, where we found a happy and acceptable solution, and the other was the board, where there was some controversy."
"I am one of those who has always argued for small boards for these authorities and agencies, as I did for the Food Safety Authority, but in this case there is a fundamental reason why we need to have every Member State represented on the board and that is because every Member State may be asked to contribute to the work of the centre."
"That is sensible."
"I am grateful also that we have been able to ensure that we have parliamentary representation on the board."
"It is urgent that this set-up should be in place by 2005 and for that reason we have to do this in a single reading, given the complexities of the parliamentary year ahead."
"It has been a complex process of consultation with colleagues and with the Council that has led to a complex set of mainly technical and linguistic amendments."
"We now have two blocks of amendments; the first are those that I commend to this House, and the second those that are superseded by the first."
"There are then two further amendments tabled by the ELDR Group and I have to say to the House that, whatever one thinks of those amendments, were they to be accepted it would jeopardise the possibility of having this measure brought forward by 2005."
"I therefore have to ask the House to reject those two amendments."
"This report has only been possible because of the collaboration with my colleagues in my Group and across the groups, and I am deeply grateful to them, to the shadow rapporteurs, to the Group, the committee and the parliamentary secretariats."
"Our discussions and debates have also played a role, including those with the Commission and the Council, which have often been forceful, yet always positive."
"I am grateful both to the former Italian presidency and the current Irish presidency for the work we have been able to do together."
"This proposal will enhance our Community and national ability to look after public health throughout the European Union."
"It will enable us to work with other countries beyond the European Union to prevent, control and defeat the health threats that we face today."
"I commend this measure to the House."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to offer my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Obviously I am going to say how urgent we believe it is for this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be set up."
"This is also apparent from the discussions we have just had this morning and those we had last year at a time when the health threats were severe."
"We need to put a system in place that will enable us to respond both effectively and swiftly because, as everyone knows, diseases know no borders."
"Not to mention that the risks of propagation are all the greater for exchanges between people and movements to the four corners of the globe being increasingly frequent."
"Finally, the potential threat of bioterrorism means we need to be particularly vigilant."
"Having said that, we must not worry the public, but rather prevent risk and put in place every possible means of detection and rapid response."
"Such an approach therefore requires very close coordination between the Member States and concerted action to pool resources, competences and knowledge."
"With this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control we are establishing a Europe of immune defence."
"I therefore hope that this Centre will be able to provide objective and easy to understand information about health risks for the public at large and in particular that it will be operational as soon as possible."
"We must not delay but work to see that it is set up."
"In this regard, everyone must show a sense of responsibility, at all costs avoiding – and this is perhaps where I differ slightly from the rapporteur – potential conflicts arising from interests associated with national representation, for example."
"This centre is not in fact intended to replace the national authorities but to help them to network, obviously, with the competent Community agencies like the European Food Safety Authority, the European Drugs Agency and, of course, all the national authorities."
"As regards the choice of headquarters, I hope it will be as operational as possible and that we will avoid fruitless arguments."
"None of this, though, will do any good unless we apply our European research efforts to all these health questions."
"As we are always saying in this Chamber – my fellow Member Mrs Roth-Behrendt said it just now – we would like the Member States to listen to us at last."
"Mr President, Commissioner, recent developments in the health sector have shown that one Member State alone, even if it has all the necessary means, cannot efficiently address all the threats."
"The transmission of epidemics is facilitated by movements of populations, environmental and social changes, globalisation and war."
"The Community, alongside its obligations which derive from the Treaties, must also respond to citizens' concerns."
"That is why the creation of a centre which will focus on prompt diagnosis and on evaluating and publicising existing and re-emerging risks to public health in a fast, flexible and efficient manner is long overdue."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will coordinate and reinforce the work of the European Commission, the Member States and the Network for Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases."
"It will operate in cooperation with all the existing services involved in public health, such as the World Health Organisation and the European Food Safety Authority."
"On behalf of my group, Mr President, and following recent developments – I refer to the previous debate which we had on bird flu – I should like to emphasise that we agree with the rapporteur's proposal to close the matter at first reading and for the centre to open in 2005, even if we are not entirely satisfied with the Council's positions."
"However, I should like to thank the rapporteur for accepting my proposals to extend the scope of the regulation to other serious health threats and not just communicable diseases."
"I should also like to thank him because he accepted the need for the repercussions of recent epidemics on both physical and mental health to be recorded and handled appropriately."
"For funding, Commissioner, it is vital that the Centre have its own line in the budget and appropriations which will allow it to respond to its difficult mission."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur once again."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, as others have already said, a little under a year ago in this very place, when the SARS epidemic was at its height, we called for the creation of a European centre to deal with modern day epidemics; so far as its tasks were concerned, at any rate, it would be modelled on the Atlanta CDC."
"Obviously this was something that needed to be done at European level, first and foremost because no fewer than 19 new emergent and fatal viruses have appeared since 1976, viruses that know no frontiers and move as fast as an aeroplane: Aids, the Ebola virus, the West Nile virus, SARS, to name but a few."
"It is something that needs to be done at European level, too, because this is where Europe’s health must be defended whenever that can and must be done better here than at the other levels, be it local authorities, regions or states."
"And that is clearly the case now, when we are having to combat these viruses that are transmissible to man."
"The epidemic of atypical pneumonia has confirmed the courage of those researchers and doctors who have risked their lives to alert the international community, and even if Europe has escaped relatively unscathed in this case, we must remain vigilant."
"SARS has not been wiped out and, as many have said this morning, other viruses are lying in wait for a new mutation that will make the leap to man, like bird flu."
"That is why common sense, the relevance of the proposals made by our rapporteur, Mr Bowis – whom I also want to thank warmly here – and the quality of the compromise reached with the Irish Presidency require that tomorrow we applaud the rapid creation of this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"As I was saying, this organisation will have many precise and vital tasks: the ability to respond swiftly to a viral epidemic or one deliberately caused by a bioterrorist attack, information to the public on all the risks of contamination, greater international cooperation, chiefly with the WHO of course."
"This centre will also – and I am not the first to say or reiterate it today – (and why not?) have to create a European network of laboratories and contribute to the search for vaccines for these diseases that are still resistant to antibiotics."
"The marketing of an antiviral vaccine or antiviral drugs is always a race against the clock and sometimes takes decades."
"That is why it is essential that we continue to invest as much in screening tests, I should say, as in inactivation technologies."
"In this connection, I note Commissioner Byrne’s commitment – as he said just now – to push the limits of the Treaty as far as he can in the matter."
"Meanwhile, in the short term, in 2005 that is, the Europe of the 25 will have its Disease Prevention and Control Centre, and we must look beyond that very strong signal to the sign of a Europe of health that is advancing."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by complimenting Mr Bowis on the professionalism, determination and timeliness with which he concluded the drafting of this important report."
"I also congratulate the rapporteur on his immense efforts in negotiations with the Council to reach an agreement at first reading."
"I believe, in fact, that it is of the utmost importance that the Centre is operational as soon as possible in order to guarantee the health monitoring and the rapid alert system which must be provided by the Union in order adequately to tackle the challenges brought about by its imminent enlargement and by a globalised world which is increasingly unprotected against the spread of diseases still unknown to us: SARS in 2003 and the very recent bird flu are specific examples."
"I therefore consider that 1 January 2005 has to be the ultimate deadline for the launch of this Centre."
"Another point that I would like to stress is the initial and refresher training for all health personnel in the Member States of the Union, and the Centre should be responsible for this."
"Ready for the entrance of ten new countries, the Union should aim to provide all health systems with the instruments, means and knowledge to create an effective synergy between all Member States and, in that way, to guarantee the coherence of the Union’s action proposed by the Centre."
"I will conclude by mentioning that the ability to respond adequately to an international health threat depends, to a large extent, on pre-emptively adopting preparatory plans for rapid action, coordinated at European level."
"The Centre should provide this essential service."
"Mr President, today is an important milestone because, after many years of debate and findings on the need to reinforce the Union's ability to take prompt, coordinated action on public health threats, we are finally discussing the setting up of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"Over the last twenty years, there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases, or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses, or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, to give but one example."
"All these crises in the public health sector, such as SARS and bird flu recently, have highlighted the weaknesses and gaps in existing structures."
"I hope that the Centre, with its small but adequate scientific operating structure, will be able to plug these gaps efficiently."
"However, if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient, it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the Member States."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur because not only did he accept the amendments which I proposed but, subsequently, in conjunction with them, two very important issues were approved and accepted which had not been included in the initial proposal."
"The first concerns the development of the strategy of vaccinations, which are an extremely important weapon in combating the threat from infections diseases."
"The second relates to the identification of topical public health issues and the promotion of the relevant, applied research, in order to reinforce our preventive capabilities and promote the efficiency of the coordinated action taken."
"Mr President, I hope that we will also overcome these final hesitations and that the Centre will soon be up and running, even in its present, restricted form."
"– Thank you, Mr President; ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to avoid repeating what has already been said, and also to avoid taking a diversion into discussing communicable diseases such as influenza, viruses and so on."
"Mr Bowis started his speech by saying that ‘he who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything’."
"In that case, this morning, I feel very rich, for I have everything."
"I have hope, and that is everything."
"I have little more than that."
"I hope that the centre we are discussing today will very soon become operational."
"Mrs Grossetête gave a very clear description of what this centre will have to be able to do in order to be effective."
"In essence, it will have to square the circle."
"With relatively few people, based a long way away in the north of the European Union, in Sweden, it will have to maintain intensive contact with all the Member States; it will have to motivate their health ministries, spend money and build up information networks, at the same time as maintaining contact with the Commission and with Parliament."
"Although this involves squaring a circle, I do have hope, and so, like Mr Bowis, I have everything."
"I cannot do other than agree wholeheartedly with Mrs Grossetête when she says that it is important that we do our work quickly, that it is important that we get things up and running."
"It follows, though, that the people who work there will have to be highly independent, work in very unconventional ways and possess imagination and the ability to work on their own initiative."
"By no means everyone can do these things."
"Looking at a number of other authorities that we have set up over the past few years, I have to say that their success is not exactly self-evident."
"Now there is the possibility of us coming to a different conclusion."
"As my fellow-Members have spoken about this Centre in great detail, I have to say what I would have liked to have seen."
"Hope, in my mind, is associated with aspiration."
"Of course communicable diseases are important, and of course the fight against them is important in terms of protecting the citizens of this European Union of ours, but let us be clear-sighted about the fact that most people in the European Union do not die of communicable diseases; they die of cancer, of heart attacks, and of strokes."
"How is it that it is a matter of chance whether you survive a heart attack, depending on whether you live in Berlin or in Madrid, or somewhere else?"
"How is it that best practice in the treatment of cancer cases is not as yet established and communicated in the European Union?"
"I regard that as an intolerable state of affairs."
"I wish we had been more ambitious and had said that the least we need is to link up best practice within the European Union in order to fight the real diseases that we have to cope with at the moment."
"Networking would have been within the competence of the European Union, and we could have afforded it."
"We did not manage it the first time round, but I hope we will, at the second attempt, ensure that people’s recovery from serious illness is not a matter of chance and does not depend on whether they live in the North, the South, the heart of Germany or on its plains, or in some other part of the European Union."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, my colleague, John Bowis, never lets us down."
"He not only nourishes our souls with the aphorism he chooses in each of his reports, but he also ensures that the report is clear, detailed and balanced."
"Such is the case this time too."
"The agency for communicable diseases will be an immensely important body in the Union as infectious diseases have proved to be a major safety risk."
"With the enormous publicity they attract, they must be a significant factor in the insecurity the public feel."
"Bird flu has been a conspicuous topic of discussion recently, and AIDS is still unbeaten, to say nothing of older communicable diseases such as tuberculosis."
"Furthermore, the threat of bioterrorism is unfortunately a real one, as the anthrax letters we saw in 2001 showed."
"Under the Treaties the EU has a clear obligation here, and there are functional reasons that reinforce it: joint action in the preservation of public health and prevention of disease is more effective."
"For that reason, the aim to start the work of the agency promptly next year is absolutely the right one, and the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is firmly in favour of this aim."
"The regulation under discussion thus intends to establish the agency promised for Sweden in the package agreed at the European Council in December."
"I would hope the farce over the multiannual aspect of the decision on the package will later on mean there will be an amendment to the decision-making process; although the decision to establish the new agency is obviously governed by the requirement of consensus in the Council, such a detail as its geographical location should be decided by a majority."
"As far as the balance of competences of the Union and the Member States is concerned, only the former system has importance."
"The latter only gives rise to national chauvinism, and that should be curbed where possible by revising the decision-making structures."
"Mr President, the creation of a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has never been so important."
"The recent SARS outbreak, the current threat of a biological terrorist attack and even the current Asian bird flu crisis illustrate the threat from disease in the global village that we live in today."
"The threat to Europe's health from the rapid spread of disease is real and present."
"Every year 1.4 billion passengers fly on an international trip."
"Every one of them could pose a threat to global health security."
"If they were found to be carrying a new strain of influenza or SARS they could within a few hours unwittingly put the lives of millions at risk."
"Global warming threatens even Britain with diseases such as malaria, while diseases such as TB are already returning."
"The correct response is not to turn our backs on the benefits of globalisation – we should not give up the opportunities presented by increases in trade and travel because of biological threats any more than for reasons of terrorism – but we need coordinated action."
"In today's world no one country can afford to go it alone."
"That is why Labour MEPs so firmly back these proposals for a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"When it comes to tackling disease, Europe works."
"The European Commission was able to ban chicken imports from countries affected by the new strain of bird flu with immediate effect."
"Without the EU, it would have required an enormous effort to coordinate the actions of all 15 – and soon 25 – Member States."
"We need to strengthen that coordination and not weaken it through isolation."
"So I am pleased that Tory MEPs will also back this plan today."
"However, I wonder how they can square that with their own hostility to Europe and their policy of attacking the EU at every turn."
"The centre will contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the prevention and monitoring of human diseases in the EU."
"Its technical work and research capabilities will be an asset, as will the work with the WHO."
"I agree that accessibility to information for the public is vital, and that is why the centre should have its own website to communicate its work and to publish its opinions."
"This is one of the EU's success stories, and we should be celebrating its creation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo the thanks expressed to the rapporteur, Mr Bowis."
"He really did have a very difficult brief, for initially it was not clear at all that our proposal would meet with general approval; the German Federal Government, for example, was very sceptical at first."
"Mrs Stihler may like to note that it was, in this respect, more Eurosceptic than the British Conservatives."
"Mr Bowis has managed to handle such a controversial topic in such a way that we are on the verge of reaching agreement, and that it really is possible to bring this matter to a conclusion at first reading and before enlargement."
"I think it was and is inconsistent for the European Union to have very strong competences when it comes to dealing with the diseases of animals, and to be able to take direct action, but that the same is not the case as regards the combating of diseases that affect human beings, and that, when human health is endangered, the first thing said is the magic word ‘subsidiarity’. I am all in favour of subsidiarity;"
"I am not in favour of a European super-authority, nor of total harmonisation of health care provision, but this is where European action is right, as we saw from the many examples given in this morning’s debate on avian influenza."
"Whilst we have to use the Member States’ competences, this is something we have to bring together at the European level."
"I think it right that we should take a pragmatic approach, by starting with communicable diseases – which are the most urgent problem at the moment – and then see where we go from there."
"I also think what Mr Trakatellis said was very important, namely that joint debate and the development of vaccination policies must be priorities."
"My final comment is addressed to the Council, represented here not by ministers but by officials."
"Many Members of this House have made reference to bio-terrorism."
"Over three months ago, I addressed a question on this issue to the Council, which it should, in the normal course of events, have answered after six weeks."
"I am still awaiting a reply."
"Bio-terrorism is too important an issue for us to allow ourselves such delays."
". Mr President, this interesting debate highlights the urgency and importance of this proposal."
"The political pressure to have the centre set up and running as soon as possible reflects the needs and concerns of European citizens."
"For the Europe of today, where millions of people cross national borders every day, we need to be in a position to take rapid, coordinated action at EU level to best protect the health of our citizens."
"This is precisely what the centre aims to achieve."
"By pooling our scientific expertise and reinforcing our rapid alert systems, the ECDC will allow better preparation and swifter and more effective responses to disease outbreaks."
"In summing up this morning's debate, I would like to focus on three central issues in the proposal which have been key areas of concern: the mission and the tasks of the centre; the possible extension of its sphere of operation; and the composition of the management board."
"There is broad agreement between the institutions on the initial scope of the centre."
"We all agree that it should start with communicable diseases and be able to respond to cases of unexpected outbreaks of unknown origin."
"The Council and Parliament share the view that there needs to be an external evaluation to assess the feasibility of extending the scope based on the performance and impact of the centre, as resources permit."
"Clearly, the budget for the centre will dictate its expansion, and beyond 2006 this has to be decided within the new financial perspectives."
"To enable the centre to start, and for it to make an impact, the Commission is prepared to accept this approach, but it means that when the question of the need to extend its remit arises we should – and would – expect Parliament and the Council to address such a proposal rapidly, under the codecision procedure."
"As regards the organisational aspects of the centre, the proposal provides for responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre to be granted to the director."
"The advisory forum is the place for the director to seek advice from his or her peers – and the forum would ensure the shared ownership of this venture with the Member States."
"The Commission can accept the extension of the membership of the advisory forum to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations and academics."
"It will be an advantage for the director to have broader views when developing the operation of the centre."
"The management board should steer policy and make decisions."
"The Commission’s proposal balances this dual responsibility in a way which we consider to be the most efficient and transparent."
"This approach is based on the principles defined in the Commission communication on the governance of European Agencies."
"In a resolution adopted last month, Parliament welcomed this communication, recognising the need to limit the size of the boards of the agencies."
"The Commission wants to follow a consistent approach on this matter, as currently each agency seems to follow a different path."
"I now note that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a board for the ECDC to consist of one representative per Member State, three from the Commission and two from Parliament."
"The Commission considers that a board of 30 members is unwieldy and may hamper the decision-making process."
"Although, given the competences involved and being exercised here, I agree with the rapporteur that a good case can be made for one member per Member State being on the board."
"The Commission notes, however, the terms of the compromise supported by Council and Parliament and is therefore willing, despite our concerns, to go along with this compromise, given the importance that it attaches to the rapid establishment of the centre."
"The Commission notes that the evaluation provided for in Article 31 of the regulation will cover the working practises of the centre, including the composition and functioning of the management board."
"A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament(1)."
"In short, this states that the Commission accepts all amendments that are part of the compromise package as set out by the rapporteur."
"I also join with the rapporteur in urging that amendments the package should not – and cannot – be accepted by the Commission."
"I conclude by thanking the rapporteur and Parliament."
"When I formulated this idea in my mind some years ago, I not only got the support that I would expect from my own services, but also very strong support from Parliament."
"We should be proud of ourselves today."
"By voting tomorrow on this issue we are reacting in a timely way in circumstances where we see communicable diseases on a global basis."
"We have discussed it in the last debate here in Parliament."
"We can proudly say to our citizens that we are responding well and quickly to their needs in relation to issues associated with communicable disease."
"Sometimes we can be unduly pessimistic and critical of ourselves."
"This is one occasion where we can stand up and say that we have done our work well and quickly, we have responded to the needs, and we can look our citizens in the eye and tell them that we have done our work well."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0022/2004) by Mr Garot, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the own-initiative report on agricultural incomes is to help us review the implementation of the European agricultural model based on multifunctionality and the competitiveness of farms."
"Incomes are in fact the barometer of the viability of farms."
"Without sufficient incomes, farmers disappear and production moves away from the most fragile areas."
"But if farmers are eliminated and concentration accelerates, we risk moving away from the European model we advocate, which involves the presence of farmers on all territories."
"The analysis of incomes is therefore of obvious interest."
"The relevant findings for the period 1995 to 2002 are as follows."
"Firstly, the average agricultural income in the Europe of the 15 rose by 7% with large national variations, for example +32% in Portugal and –30% in the United Kingdom."
"Secondly, public support accounts for more than 50% of this figure, but its distribution is debatable."
"Twenty percent of farms receive 73% of aids for 59% of areas and 25% of employment."
"Thirdly, producer prices fell by 1.1% while consumer prices rose 11%."
"Fourthly, the slight improvement in this average income comes from the fact that the cake is shared between fewer and fewer farmers since the number of people working in this sector fell by 15.7% over the same period."
"We must therefore ask ourselves whether the phenomenon can be allowed to continue without jeopardising our European model of agriculture."
"This question is all the more serious because the application of multifunctionality is going to result in higher production costs even though public support is set to decline for farmers of the 15 Member States between now and 2013, chiefly because of the rise in Community support for agriculture in the ten new countries."
"The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation."
"We need to give some thought to the direction of future changes to the CAP to make it consistent with the two objectives of multifunctionality and competitiveness which we have set for farms."
"From this point of view, the market must tend to reward the act of agricultural production."
"As for public support, it must increasingly go to pay for the non-market services that agriculture performs for society."
"The most recent CAP reform includes positive steps forward in this direction, especially with the conditionality and modulation of aids."
"With decoupling, though, the CAP is establishing historically acquired rights that will have the effect of preventing remuneration for multifunctionality for all farms on all territories."
"It is therefore absolutely essential to get away from these historical rights, something that will be possible gradually if modulation is substantially increased."
"On the matter of market-generated income, I recommend restoring priority to pricing and market policy, taking the view that progress in product quality, necessary as it is, is only the passport giving access to those markets."
"Several directions will therefore have to be opened up or reaffirmed so that the market can play its part without prices collapsing and taking incomes with them."
"I will quote them: ‘flexible, production-based regulation of supply; the introduction of production-based safety nets;"
"From this report, Members will all understand that there is still a tremendous amount to be done if the CAP is to achieve its objectives."
"Our European agricultural model was legitimate in its conception."
"It must become so in reality again."
"That is why I regret the Commissioner’s absence from this debate all the more."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mr Garot for his own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union."
"Speaking personally, I want to thank him especially for his frank and constructive cooperation in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The Member States are currently engaged in implementing as part of their national policies the Luxembourg Conclusions on reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Our starting point is that, in accordance with the Brussels Conclusions, the agricultural budget was capped."
"The funds available must from now on be shared out among farmers in the EU of 25 rather than only in the EU of 15, and moreover, must in future be more discriminatingly applied than was previously the case, so that funds from the first pillar – direct payments, in other words – are to be moved to the second pillar, to rural development."
"This is something that all of us in this House have always demanded."
"Mr Garot’s report represents an outstanding assessment of the situation in that it analyses, in the light of enlargement, the factors on which agricultural incomes are currently dependent."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that there are fundamental objectives to be achieved by means of the common agricultural policy."
"They are as follows: firstly, to guarantee a fair level of income for those who work in agriculture."
"Secondly, by stabilising incomes, it must maintain agricultural activity throughout the whole area of the European Union."
"It is for that reason that we believe, firstly, that the retention of the level of public subsidies for agriculture is justified, in particular to reward the multifunctional services it renders to society and to ensure that farmers remain present in all regions, as is provided for in the first pillar."
"Secondly, we believe there is justification for the Community Budget guaranteeing employment, especially in less-favoured rural areas, and for farms to be rewarded for adaptation to society’s new demands, which is what we understand by the second pillar."
"In the hope of turning these principles into reality, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, a number of amendments, to which – as I mentioned at the start of my speech – we have been able to secure the rapporteur’s agreement."
"For example, our specific proposals include the introduction of a system of disaster payments, which is already the practice in other great agricultural nations."
"We specifically demand that a large proportion of the funds available remain, insofar as possible, in the hands of farmers."
"It necessarily follows that we are in favour of the norm laid down in the Luxembourg Conclusions – in other words, the single farm payment – being applied when they are implemented at national level."
"Our final demand is that no major distortions of competition within European agriculture should be allowed to result in the event of the exemption under Article 58 being chosen."
"Let me conclude by saying that we have to bear in mind that competitiveness and multifunctionality must, again and again, be subjected to scrutiny and assessed, and that due regard must be paid to development."
"Without an adequate income, no farmer will be able to perform his tasks in producing food and in caring for the Garden of Eden that we still – thank heaven! – have here in Europe, in a professional manner and in line with good practice."
"We must therefore take the funds available in the agriculture budget and apply them, in a Europe of 25 Member States, in such a way that the competitiveness of working farmers in the market is supported."
"We must never lose sight of the need to guarantee young farmers a start and to offer them good prospects."
"These, more than ever, are the challenges we must take up."
"The common agricultural policy adopted in June 2003 opens up interesting ways of doing this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Garot on his excellent report; much of what has already been said I do not need to repeat."
"Discussion of farmers’ incomes is long overdue; the fact is that they are far too low."
"The various underlying causes I will illustrate by reference to the example of Germany."
"One of the most important is that farmers are still unable to command on the market the prices that they need for their products and which would be quite justified."
"The causes of this state of affairs can be traced back to the fierce competition between the six or seven food concerns that dominate the market, a turf war fought out to the detriment of farmers."
"These concerns see farmers as nothing more than suppliers of cheap raw materials. I might add that the same is true of many dairies."
"To that can be added the fact that consumers, that is, most people, do not know anything about this and, indeed to some extent, do not want to."
"The fact is that high-quality food, for example that produced in accordance with high standards of protection for the environment and for animals, comes at a price; it is not to be had for free."
"Even the , the German Farmers’ Union, which represents the interests of most German farmers, has had its hand in this, for – in my opinion – it has for far too long not merely blocked or delayed important reforms, but has positively prevented some of them."
"Its unending lamentations, which have been its stock-in-trade for decades, about how badly-off farmers have now virtually made the public deaf to farmers’ legitimate demands and needs."
"Let me add that many farmers tell me these things at events once the ’s functionaries have gone."
"The reforms adopted over the past year are thus all the more important to farmers; they should have been adopted years ago."
"The decoupling of payments from production was long overdue."
"Here, in this House, we have done our bit; it is now for the Member States to properly implement these conclusions and to do away once and for all with the unfair treatment of different types of farming, such as, for example, dairy cattle and arable farming."
"Let me quote you some figures."
"Up to now, 20% of the farms with 59% of the land and 25% of the jobs have been getting 73% of the direct grants, and, let it be noted, relatively little was to be seen or heard of those who are now so loudly indignant about the injustice that is allegedly going to result from the agricultural reform."
"We Social Democrats support compensatory payments for farmers because they have to be rewarded appropriately for the services that they perform in the general interest within a multifunctional system and which the prices paid do not cover."
"This must, however, be done in accordance with transparent, open, and comprehensible rules."
"None of us can evade the question of what high-quality foodstuffs are actually worth to us."
"For the engine in our cars we buy only the best and most expensive petrol, but when it comes to the body, which is our own engine, without which we cannot exist and which is meant to work for at least 100 years without spluttering, most of us are completely indifferent to what we put into it."
"All that matters is that there should be a lot of it and that it should be cheap."
"That is not on."
"Even though this may be wishful thinking at present, we do believe that it would be for the best if farmers were to be able to have a good living from the prices paid for their produce."
"That is what we Social Democrats are working for."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Garot for a valuable contribution to the debate on farmers’ incomes."
"Mr Garot is a committed politician on agricultural matters. He is well informed and takes a positive view of agriculture."
"I have to say that, as a Swede, I am rather envious."
"We could have done with a few Social Democrats of that kind in the Swedish Government."
"It would have been very useful for us."
"Allow me to address a number of points I think are important."
"Mr Garot states that agriculture should be carried on throughout the whole area of the EU."
"That is very important to remember, especially when the parts of the EU concerned are those such as I myself come from, that is to say Sweden or Finland."
"He also addresses another very important matter, namely the difference between cost development and price development."
"A discrepancy arises that can be resolved with the help of rationalisation, but not to an unlimited degree."
"It must be ensured that this discrepancy does not become too large."
"We have seen how it has increased in my own country following the latter’s accession to the EU."
"It is now far too large, and production is in decline."
"We have defended the agricultural reform. That has been decided upon."
"It is not, however, good for it to be implemented at different speeds in different countries."
"This is important, something that is also pointed out in the report."
"When the agricultural reform is implemented at different speeds, there is a danger of making further changes to competitiveness or of creating an uneven playing field in the different countries where competitiveness is concerned."
"It is now a matter of extreme urgency to do as much as is humanly possible in terms of environmental aid and aid for rural development."
"As Mr Garot says in his report, there is a danger of this being undermined if the Member States are to cofinance it."
"This is an area I am concerned about."
"I must, however, address a number of aspects of this report that I do not think are as good."
"It is rather anti-reform, if I may say so."
"The desire is to keep as many people as possible in agriculture."
"I do not believe that this is realistic in the long term."
"I do not believe it is realistic to retain far-reaching market regulation or prices set by politicians, nor to have a regulated supply of the type we have involving quotas."
"We must seek to reduce border protection in order to cope with world trade."
"Now that we are carrying out this disengagement, it would have been better if we could have done it completely from the beginning and, in fact, throughout the EU in the one go."
"As a result of these considerations, I and many others in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will unfortunately abstain from voting."
"We cannot vote in favour of this report but, in view of all the plus points I mentioned at the beginning, we cannot vote against it, either."
"We shall no doubt abstain from voting in the final vote, because it is only a single vote."
"– Mr President, underlying the whole report is the fundamental idea that people in the European Community – and in all its regions, widely divergent in their structure though they are – have a job and hence an entitlement to an income commensurate with what they produce."
"If I am right in my understanding of what the rapporteur said, then it is only if that is the case that one can talk of there being such a thing as social European Union."
"The report rightly points out that yields vary widely across the European Union, even though Europe’s climate and other natural conditions are favourable to almost all crops."
"The principal causes of the changes in costs over recent years are well-known."
"My expectation of future reforms is that the Commission will take more account of their ability to influence the cost structure."
"I also expect openings to be created for more investments, and I hope that a greater diversity of programmes will result in simplification and clarity of vision."
"As in other reports, reference is made to the fact that direct payments to farmers, being factored in as sources of income, cannot simply be cut out without the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, and I believe, with regret, that there are those who want that to happen."
"More and more people in Europe’s rural areas are doing more than one job, and so every euro that is not spent on structural planning and development in rural areas – I am talking in terms of billions – is always associated with the loss of income and jobs."
"This makes it important to assess whether the work and the way the European agricultural model is applied tend towards appropriate rewards for European farmers, and what is meant by that."
"About this, the rapporteur is rather reticent, the reason being that there is a lack of data."
"My expectation, though, is that, as the market organisation develops further, we will be able to answer the question of what an appropriate income for farmers actually is."
"In Germany, farmers’ incomes have dropped dramatically, by 6.1% and 19.8% in the last two financial years."
"That amounts to an overall economic crash."
"This bleak state of affairs has come about for two reasons; one is flooding and drought, but – as has already been said in this debate – it has far more to do with the price war in food retailing, in which farmers are generally on the losing side."
"How are the location of production, and hence employment and income, affected by the decoupling of payments and their being linked to environmental requirements – an attempt at riding two horses, in giving the market a greater role in determining farmers’ incomes while rewarding with public funds services that are no longer in demand?"
"Will it ensure extensive agricultural land use?"
"Far from it; it is far more to be feared that it will lead to the onset of predatory competition and that we will be facing structural changes that will leave local areas worse off."
"That is something I do not want."
"– Mr President, Mr Garot has produced a good report, and it is to his credit that he has brought the price of produce back to the centre of the debate."
"Decoupling has facilitated the removal of the twofold price distortions brought about by payments, which tended to keep prices down and thus gave customers the opportunity to get their hands on cheap raw materials, in that the linking of grants to production – which was itself unequally distributed – meant that between 75% and 80% of this State aid was claimed by between 20% and 25% of farms."
"Now, even though decoupling is in place – and it was the right step to take – it does not automatically follow that different power relations have come into being; rather, what matters is that prices should be actively negotiated."
"This is not just about the distributing chains, but also about the cooperatives, some of them managed by farmers, which pursue their price and market policies in decision-making bodies, and it is about better payments for raw materials – agricultural raw materials."
"You have also made it clear that we now have to talk about modulation and about different ways of distributing these funds."
"Modulation must link the practice of some large and rationalised farming enterprises receiving from the state a premium amounting to EUR 100 000 per worker, to the number of employees and also to the type of production. From this, quality criteria must be developed, in order that state funds do not contribute to the accumulation of assets and give the wrong stimuli to production, but instead, enable the continuation of rural production methods in Europe."
"Mr President, I join in congratulating Mr Garot on his report."
"The recent hearing on farm income must surely have alerted all of us to the challenges facing EU farmers."
"It is easy to understand their frustration as they see their purchasing power eroded and their general quality of life under attack on many fronts."
"Mr Garot succeeds in his report in focusing our minds on the basics of the common agricultural policy and what it is all about."
"We have a treaty basis for ensuring that farmers and their families are guaranteed a decent standard of living."
"We also have an obligation to maintain the European model of agriculture, which is based on family farm units and keeping a vibrant rural community."
"Those who seek to undermine the common agricultural policy sometimes forget these basics."
"They forget that there is a socio-economic dimension to farming and that it is not just a business like any other sector."
"Mr Garot presents these facts very clearly."
"The fact that between 1995 and 2002 farm incomes in the European Union rose by an average of 7% highlights the very large disparities between countries, between crops and between producers."
"It also hides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 15.7% in the number of farms within the European Union."
"Here, surely, lies one of the most serious challenges facing the continuity of European agriculture."
"Frequently farms have been able to revert to short-term measures such as foregoing necessary capital investment on farms."
"There has also been huge growth in part-time farming and off-farm employment."
"When we compare agricultural to industrial or service wages we can see that there is a continuing widening gap."
"In conclusion, this report highlights important challenges that we legislators and policy-makers have to face up to."
"It is now essential that agricultural policy should still be used to protect and improve the incomes of as many householders as possible within the European Union and to guarantee a secure future for our farmers and their families."
"– Mr President, this report is a good initiative and I congratulate its author."
"In fact, it brings us up to date on agricultural incomes just before the application of CAP reform and the enlargement of the European Union."
"It will therefore serve us as a reference document in a few years’ time, when, I hope, we shall be meeting together in this Assembly again to consider the consequences of the reform for our farmers’ incomes."
"Will the accession of ten new countries that are themselves highly agricultural and the alignment of European agricultural prices with world prices bring us a better future?"
"I do not want to be a prophet of doom, but unfortunately I doubt it."
"This report underlines some important facts, in particular the 7% increase in European agricultural incomes over seven years, which hides many disparities between regions and sectors and is rooted in a degradation of the European agricultural model, as the rapporteur pointed out in his address."
"In ten years, one quarter of Europe’s farmers have vanished, farms have become larger and production has intensified."
"Some French small farmers have such low incomes that the French Government gives them access to the ‘integration minimum income’, a system of social support reserved for the most deprived."
"I come from the Vosges, a rural not far from here."
"Between 1988 and 2000, the number of farms there fell by 40% and the number of dairy farms halved."
"At the same time, farm areas increased 65% and the number of cows per farm 30%."
"This concentration in agriculture is damaging to the European family agricultural model, as the Parliamentary report very clearly shows."
"Decoupled aids are not a viable solution for the farmer."
"According to the Nantes INRA study, in 2008 partial decoupling could result in as much as a 32% drop in simulated income for an intensive dairy farmer because the decoupled aids will not compensate for the 20% fall in the price of milk envisaged for 2006-2008."
"The drafting of this report gave an opportunity to consult a number of experts on the subject."
"They all underlined this intrinsic paradox of the latest common agricultural policy reform."
"How indeed can we think of pushing up costs through multifunctionality while at the same time wanting agricultural prices to fall by bringing European prices into line with world prices?"
"What solution is there for farmers trapped between rising production costs and falling prices."
"No expert has been able to tell us that."
"Finally, the report explains a risk that is of particular concern to me, namely the eco-conditionality of aids for small farms, since their income is going to depend increasingly on aids, especially with decoupling."
"A small farmer who failed to comply with one of a very large number of directives, including the Loiseau directive, would have his aids, and therefore his income, cut off."
"The incomes of farmers who are already fragile and who have little capacity to invest will be reduced."
"This report puts its finger on the painful points of the common agricultural policy and its latest reform, and I can only welcome these facts being brought out into the open."
"However, some parts of the report remain ambiguous and I cannot support them."
"I cannot ask the Member States, and I quote: ‘to ensure that partial decoupling is actually applied’, because I have always opposed any form of decoupling, be it partial or total."
"Likewise, I am not in favour of, and I quote: ‘ensuring a readjustment in favour of the second pillar’."
"The first pillar, which allows farmers to maintain a lucrative price for agricultural products, cannot be weakened in order to subsidise the second."
"This Parliamentary report has the merit of clearly presenting some important and sometimes painful realities of the common agricultural policy."
"However, it includes an ambiguous support for key aspects of the CAP reform, against which my group has spoken out, and that is why I will find it very difficult to support it."
"– Mr President – unfortunately I cannot add ‘Commissioner Fischler’, as his seat is empty – ladies and gentlemen, the interest of this own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union lies more in the questions it raises than in the answers it seeks to give."
"Its starting point is beyond dispute."
"We can use whatever fine words we want about the European agricultural model – multifunctional, kind to the environment and animal welfare, guaranteeing food safety, covering all our territories – but if the players are not there to implement it, that is farmers with enough income to do what they have to do, to live from their activities and attract the next generation, then the model will remain a utopia, a mirage, semantics, a lie."
"The problem the report describes is indeed the one we are going to have to face in the years ahead."
"If the average income of the Community farmer – an abstract and therefore artificial statistical concept – has not already collapsed further despite the policy of systematically cutting prices, it has been at the price of very severe restructurings characterised by a dramatic reduction in the number of people working on farms and a very rapid increase in the concentration of farms together with the intensification of production."
"But if we want to maintain the greatest number of farmers on all the territory of the Member States in future, we will no longer be able to have this trilogy of disappearance, concentration and intensiveness."
"Europe can no longer count on those types of adjustment to maintain its agriculture and develop its agricultural model."
"Neither can it count any longer on an increase in the agricultural budget to cover the extra costs that the new standards concerning multifunctionality demanded by society will entail."
"Quite the contrary, that budget is set to decline over the next ten years, with no prospect of a reversal of that trend in sight."
"Unlike the rapporteur, I believe that the June 2003 reform, which was inspired primarily by non-agricultural considerations – the desire to reach a general agreement in the WTO and a desire to make budget savings – offers little prospect of a solution to the problem."
"On the contrary, with decoupling it is more likely to accelerate concentration, intensification and land speculation, all trends which will have the effect of deterring young people from taking up farming and accelerating the monetarisation of the sector."
"If we want to avoid all this, we must redefine the concept of Community preferences and we cannot put off doing so indefinitely."
"When there are emergent countries with structural production conditions that utterly destroy the competitiveness of European agriculture, it is irresponsible to believe that only a policy of product quality or niche products will produce sufficient incomes to enable our farmers to continue occupying all our territories while providing society with the products and production conditions it wants."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Garot on his report."
"He is one of the Members of this House whom I hold in very high esteem."
"However, if I read his report, my criticism in this case is that the Socialist dimension is far too prevailing."
"Too much attention has been paid to the premiums while too little consideration has been given to the competitiveness of agriculture and horticulture."
"It is generally the case that the European debate on incomes in agriculture is too much dominated by the question as to the level of premiums rather than what the market problems are."
"Starting with the premiums, the Netherlands receives far too small a share of the European budget."
"The Netherlands accounts for 7% of agricultural production in the European Union, yet only receives 2.1% of the agricultural budget and 1% of the rural development budget."
"This is out of all proportion."
"Of course, there is a reason for this."
"The negotiations in Berlin in 1999 were conducted by Mr Kok and Mr Zalm, neither of whom had any affinity with agriculture and horticulture."
"That is not only the reason why the Dutch countryside does not receive what it is entitled to; it is also the real reason why the Dutch net contribution to the European Union is so high."
"This excessive contribution is best remedied by giving the Netherlands a substantially higher amount for agriculture and rural development."
"There is also another point that is given too little consideration in the development of agricultural incomes, namely the position of the so-called free products."
"The high European requirements in terms of environment, food safety and animal welfare have a knock-on effect on the cost price of – for example – meat, vegetables and potatoes, and put European agriculture at a worldwide disadvantage in terms of cost price."
"That is the real reason underlying a number of crises, including the current one in pig farming."
"My proposal is that in the case of new European legislative proposals affecting agriculture and horticulture, an income assessment should be done in order to check the true repercussions of this legislation on the workers in the fields."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the general praise for Mr Garot’s wonderful report, which is as timely as it is necessary."
"Mr President, Mr Garot’s rigorous analysis provides data confirming our concern at the danger posed by the reform of the CAP if its negative impact on agricultural incomes is not neutralised."
"I very much regret the seriously misguided and inconsistent way in which certain Members, on the one hand, heap great praise on the report because it is good, but, on the other, say that they are not going to support it."
"Mr President, the fundamental objective of the CAP is to guarantee a fair standard of living for the agricultural population."
"Europe needs multifunctional and viable agriculture, but this means that we must protect the European model, create a system of crisis management, guarantee employment and increase the resources dedicated to the second pillar."
"All of this is proposed by Mr Garot in this wonderful report."
"Especially worthy of note are paragraph 7 – which the Commission should apply – which points out that the costs of production are tending to increase while aid is tending to decrease; paragraph 17, which relates to guaranteeing employment; and paragraphs 24 and 25 relating to the second pillar."
"Finally, Mr President, the Commission must take account of the view expressed by Mr Garot in paragraph 25 on cofinancing, as a demand which may hinder rural development, with a view to making this cofinancing requirement more flexible in the reform in the CAP."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has made a really honourable attempt to embellish the common agricultural policy and its tragic consequences for farmers, but without managing to do anything more than repeat the set of arguments which the Commission has also cited from time to time in order to justify its unjustifiable CAP and its reforms."
"Arguments which have proven to be thoroughly disorientating and hypocritical in the past are being shamelessly used again today, precisely in order to continue the same anti-farming policy."
"What social and multifunctional agriculture is the rapporteur talking about when, during the 1995-2002 reference period, the workforce fell by 15.7%, with a commensurate reduction in agricultural households?"
"Behind it, this number conceals the abandonment of entire areas, especially in the Mediterranean countries, it conceals the increase in unemployment and migration to the towns, with all the consequential problems and with incalculable consequences for environmental protection, for which the European Commission would supposedly do anything."
"He notes that agricultural incomes rose by an average of 7% in the European Union as a whole from 1995 to 2002."
"However, this increase is less than 1% per annum, meaning that it is much less than the average increase in GDP in the European Union over the same period and it concerns an economic sector in whose products the European Union has a deficit."
"In addition, no analysis is made so that we can see which holdings reported an increase in income, how many small and medium-sized farming households had a reduction and how many went bankrupt."
"That is because the technique of averages in a differentiated social stratum such as agriculture is the best means of muddying the waters, of hiding acute class divisions and of concealing important social problems."
"So exactly what social and multifunctional agriculture are we talking about when the differential between agricultural incomes per worker is over 1 to 50 and when 20% of large holdings take up 73% of direct Community aid?"
"The unfair distribution in Community subsidies at the expense of small- and medium-sized farmers has proven over time the capitalist nature of the CAP, the objective of which is to concentrate land and production in a few capitalist farm holdings."
"Of course, wiping out small- and medium-sized farming and concentrating land will be completed by the new reform of the CAP, which is even worse than all the previous reforms."
"Let me quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production, which the rapporteur welcomes, together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of farmers from the market to become businessmen, to quote Mr Fischler."
"Reality is not consistent with the contradictory and prefabricated conclusions of the report."
"It is so gloomy that it leaves no room even for legerdemain or for further misleading farmers."
"The common agricultural policy of extermination will be fought against by the small- and medium-sized farmers in my country and the European Union, who are realising more and more every day that overturning it is the only way they will survive and …"
"Mr President, I welcome the work of the rapporteur in bringing this own-initiative report together."
"It strikes at the heart of the central question facing European agriculture at this crucial juncture, namely, whether the agricultural community can expect to make a fair living from its activities."
"One of the report's most illustrative points is that, while agricultural incomes rose by 7% in the EU between 1995 and 2002, this was at the expense of a 15% decrease in the number of farms."
"That means that small farms have been swallowed up by increasingly large farms and production that has become more intensive."
"With consumers demanding more information on the means by which their food is produced, this trend is one that must be addressed."
"Large farms, selling bulk commodities, with pollution risks and herd health problems represent a future that we must work to avoid."
"Whilst the figures may continue to suggest that incomes are growing, they hide the impact of increasingly intensive farming methods."
"This must be borne in mind each time the European Parliament – and more importantly, the European Commission – consider direct aid via the CAP."
"There is something seriously amiss with a system that continues to pump money into the pockets of some of Europe's largest and wealthiest landowners through lavish subsidies."
"The Duke of Westminster – Britain's richest man – receives EUR 1300 per day in agricultural subsidies, while small Welsh farmers are struggling to get by with as little as EUR 7000 per year."
"– Mr President, nature conservation, farms as family businesses, employment, safe food – these are all objectives to which we are trying to aspire with European agricultural policy."
"In his report, Mr Garot was right to point out that, in the final analysis, all these fine words are not worth the paper they are written on if we do not guarantee a reasonable income for the farmer."
"It is not easy to interpret the statistical income data."
"Mr Garot concludes that over the past few years, agricultural incomes in the Union have risen by 7%."
"I have checked with the researchers who supplied these figures whether this is correct."
"They state that these figures do not take into consideration production levies, interest payable, rent and labour costs."
"If one looks at the actual difference in the farmer's wallet, then between 1995 and 2001, agricultural incomes in the EU did not rise, but fell, by 6%."
"This resolution argues in favour of maintaining price and market policy and associated production control, with good reason."
"In this respect, extending supply does not, by definition, benefit agricultural incomes."
"If the milk quota is extended, the milk price continues to drop and the incomes of dairy farmers are put under pressure unnecessarily."
"The WTO Summit in Cancun has failed."
"With it, a far-reaching liberalisation of trade in agricultural products has been put on hold for the time being."
"Agriculture is not like a bicycle shop where demand from the market can simply be accommodated."
"Protection remains necessary."
"In this respect, developing countries are better served by preferential market access to the EU than unbridled free trade."
"It is unfortunate that a Socialist, of all people, who, by nature, believes in a society that can be moulded to one's will, should accept the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon."
"The rapporteur fears that agricultural support from the EU is losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the WTO."
"I do not share this fear, because as in football, it is not only about technique, but also about strategy."
"Otherwise, the French would never be able to take a game off the Dutch team!"
"I regret that in this resolution, Mr Garot is already working towards another reform: the reform of decoupled support to a form of rural policy."
"However much I applaud rural policy, it cannot replace European agricultural policy."
"Mr Garot is wrong to seize upon European agriculture's multifunctionality as an excuse for a new form of structural policy, one that has to pump money into an area on the basis of acreage instead of production value."
"If we want to sustain the family business and reject untrammelled economies of scale, our policy has to be in keeping with this."
"This entails the capping of high company allowances and a systematic protection of small- and medium-size businesses."
"This, at least, is something that will be of some use to the European farmer."
"Mr President, the agricultural sector of the European Union faces many problems."
"Greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future."
"They are anxious about whether to continue to farm their land or to join the queues of the unemployed in the towns."
"However, we cannot hope for a strong Greece unless we safeguard strong regions."
"And strong regions mean strong farmers."
"We must apply a policy which secures farmers a decent income so that they can be master of their own land; so that they have employment, prospects, a future, a productive horizon for their children."
"Regions without farmers mean a country without a future."
"Guaranteeing agricultural incomes at decent levels is not just an economic issue."
"It is, at the same time, a huge social and moral issue."
"We therefore need to follow an organised agricultural policy which will consistently and constantly lead to the strengthening of the agricultural sector."
"It is necessary, now, without delay, for us to fight bureaucracy, to simplify procedures to integrate new farmers into Community initiatives and to encourage the development of organic products with less paperwork and more support, with cheap certification of organic products and with undivided advisory support for farmers from the agriculturalists and veterinarians of the Ministry of Agriculture."
"We need to give Greek farmers the optimism which they lack today, the belief that their work has a future and that their future is close to their land, with prospects, with a serious income and with dignity."
"– Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, do I take it that you are seeking the floor for a procedural motion?"
"– Mr President, we have had an important debate on agricultural policy, but without Commissioner Fischler."
"His absence has been the subject of criticism, and it is also regrettable."
"The Commission is having a meeting on medium-term financial planning, and fairness requires that I, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, make it plain to the House that we think it important that Commissioner Fischler should be present at that meeting."
"We do, though, regret that the two commitments have overlapped, it is something that we strenuously tried to avoid, but without success."
"It is thus that we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of having to have this debate without Commissioner Fischler."
"– Thank you. Your comment will be passed on."
"The debate on the Garot report will resume at 3 p.m."
"We will now begin the vote, which, as you know, will be interrupted by a formal sitting."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, although I am sure you do not think this regulation is important, I propose to explain to you why it is; it is intended to ensure that the Member States forward reliable data on their financial transactions to Eurostat every quarter."
"This data is to include all forms of debt – in other words, not only all loans, but also general government debt."
"Reliable statistics such as these are meant, among other things, to help the European Central Bank to draw up its quarterly financial accounts for the eurozone."
"As I made clear at first reading in October, this regulation is overdue, not least because these essential items of data, which are now to be forwarded on a quarterly basis, are of decisive importance to the Stability and Growth Pact, on which is founded the stability of the euro – about which you have heard a certain amount said in recent months."
"I had hoped that we could have spared ourselves a second reading, as we had obtained the Italian Presidency’s agreement to some sensible amendments, which met with the overwhelming approval of this House at first reading."
"The regulation could, then, have entered into force before the end of 2003, but that was not to be, mainly because a number of Member States discovered that they had not after all made sufficient preparations for the required data to be transferred so quickly."
"That is in fact hard to comprehend, as one would have thought that the Member States would have an interest in knowing the state of their finances every quarter."
"Nevertheless, we are willing to agree to this more flexible approach to forwarding in order to avoid the further delays that would result if we were to insist on a conciliation procedure."
"That might well have suited those Member States that have difficulty keeping to the Stability Pact and therefore have an interest in drawing a veil over the actual level of their public debt."
"As we do not want to do these Member States a favour, I propose that we adopt the Common Position."
"Thank you Mrs Lulling."
"Thanks to you, the European Parliament is now well informed."
"Under Rule 110a(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which you know by heart, you are entitled to two minutes."
"– In view of the number of votes we still have to take,I think it reasonable to pause now that the initial votes have been taken."
"The remaining votes will be taken at the end of the formal sitting."
"(1)"
". Mr President, I have tabled Amendment No 8, which adds a new paragraph 4c, in the interests of achieving the widest possible consensus of a report that deserves support because it represents a new opening in our policy towards financial markets."
"I wish to change a word that will give more flexibility to the report and make it acceptable to more colleagues."
"I will read the amendment: 'Calls upon the Commission to undertake all necessary steps, including in particular a cost-benefit analysis of the effects on European capital markets, to assess the establishment of a competent European Registration '."
"This word replaces 'authority'."
"The rest remains unchanged."
"This change gives the flexibility desired by certain colleagues and I look forward to their support."
"– Very well, Mr Katiforis."
"Your proposal related therefore to Amendment No 8."
"Firstly, we have two others to put to the vote."
"When we arrive at Amendment No 8, I shall ask, in accordance with the procedure, if any Members are opposed to your oral amendment being taken into account."
"I see that Mr Gollnisch is aching to say something."
"If it is not genuinely about a procedural motion, I shall switch off his microphone immediately."
"– Mr President, if referring to the nature of the rules whereby our Assembly arranges to hear Heads of State speak is not a procedural motion, then I do not know what is."
"In any case, I shall be brief."
"I think that, of the foreign Heads of State received by our Parliament, many – beginning with Mr Bouteflika – have not, to say the least, been the representatives of completely democratic regimes …"
"– Mr Gollnisch, I had warned you."
"I do not see to which rule of procedure you are referring."
"This is not a procedural motion; it is a political remark, and you do not have the floor."
". Updating and harmonising social security systems are crucial issues for the Member States and hence the need to support initiatives that will help them to achieve these aims."
"The Social Protection Committee, which is intended to promote cooperation on social security policies between the Member States, the candidate countries and the Commission is one such initiative and therefore won my vote."
"The committee must monitor the social security situation in the Member States and changes in this situation."
"It must present reports, specifically on situations of poverty and social inclusion – deliver opinions, establish contacts and cooperate with the relevant bodies in this field."
"I would stress that greater priority must be given to Parliament’s role."
"The committee should inform Parliament in an efficient way so that Parliament can follow up this issue and Parliament’s position must be taken into account in all the activities of the Social Protection Committee."
"Lastly, I would emphasise that the gender balance must be respected in the composition of the Committee Delegations."
". This amendment on the Social Protection Committee, which was established by Council decision of 29 June 2000, is of a basically procedural nature."
"It was brought about by the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, on 1 February 2003, in particular by the new legal basis set out in Article 144 thereof, with the Commission and Parliament having taken the opportunity to make some changes to the approach they had adopted previously."
"One of the proposals that the EP has adopted and which I tabled in the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs seeks to ensure that the joint report on social protection pays ‘particular attention to poverty issues and to progress in social inclusion within the EU Member States and in the accession countries’."
"Proposals seeking to incorporate the gender dimension horizontally into the committee’s duties, and to report on problems specifically affecting women were also adopted, particularly on the feminisation of poverty and the changes in family models."
"I therefore believe it is important to establish indicators broken down by gender and to focus on the individual rather than on the household."
". The Treaty of Nice provides for establishing a Social Protection Committee, with consultative status, to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between Member States and between these and the Commission."
"A Social Protection Committee, with a similar status and aims, was established by Council decision of 29 June 2002, and has been operational since that date."
"The purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural: to establish the committee in accordance with the new legal basis."
"Nevertheless, we must welcome the fact that this council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation, of promoting the exchange of good practice and of establishing appropriate contacts with management and labour."
"Equally to be welcomed is the call for an annual report to be drawn up on social protection and for this to be presented to the Council and to Parliament."
"In this regard, we believe that an effective process of informing Parliament must be established to enable it regularly to monitor social protection issues, in particular those related to poverty."
"For these reasons, the report won my vote."
". As you know, the Treaty of Nice provides for establishing a Social Protection Committee, with consultative status, to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between Member States and between these and the Commission."
"A Social Protection Committee, with a similar status and aims, was established by Council decision of 29 June 2002, and has been operational since that date."
"The purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural: to establish the Council in accordance with the new legal basis."
"Nevertheless, we must welcome the fact that this Council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation."
"It will promote the exchange of good practice and establish appropriate contacts with management and labour."
"It will also aim for a more structured engagement with NGOs and to pay particular attention to poverty-related issues."
"I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal to call for a joint annual report to be drawn up and presented to the Council and the European Parliament."
"This report must include a specific chapter containing Parliament’s views on social protection issues."
"An effective process of information shall be established to permit the European Parliament to follow matters up on a regular basis, and the candidate countries must be informed and consulted."
"I voted in favour, of course."
". In recent decades, various environmental disasters have taken place, including the sinking of the , off the coast of Galicia, which has had terrible consequences as regards maritime pollution."
"There is a clear need for international cooperation, because no State is able to combat the consequences of a major maritime pollution accident on its own, and the aim of this cooperation must be to prevent and effectively combat such pollution."
"I must, therefore, support the Community’s conclusion of this Protocol on cooperation concerning combating pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, one of the protocols appended to the Barcelona Convention (a regionally-based initiative, to which 14 Mediterranean countries have signed up)."
"Given its lengthy coastline, Portugal would always have to support any initiative that promotes international cooperation with the aim of preventing and combating maritime pollution."
"There is no problem as regards the initiative’s compatibility with Community legislation, because this is even more stringent than the Protocol, since the Community has stepped up and strengthened its action in the field of preventing and combating maritime pollution."
"One example of this is the set of initiatives that we adopted here during the last part-session."
"– I voted in favour of the report, for it is imperative to conduct a determined and coordinated battle against all forms of pollution in the Mediterranean."
"Every day, the Mediterranean is the target of maritime hooligans who see it as a dustbin."
"Let us not forget that more than six million tons of pollution-producing waste is deliberately discharged into the sea every year."
"Moreover, I support the European measures advanced in the field of maritime safety following the loss of the ."
"Efforts must, however, continue unabated in order to prevent new disasters from occurring, and people, fauna and flora from paying the price."
"This fight against pollution must be accompanied by a genuine preventive policy from further up the line."
"State port control and cooperation between the maritime police of different coastal states need to be strengthened."
"The fight against those who pollute the sea must be more effective and be accompanied by heavy penalties, with all parties involved in the goods transportation chain having to assume their share of responsibility."
"To conclude, I would invite the Member States that have still not ratified this protocol to do so as soon as possible."
". I welcome the measures intended to achieve closer international cooperation in combating maritime pollution."
"The terrible accidents that have taken place in recent decades have shown that no State on its own is able to combat the consequences of a major maritime pollution accident."
"Portugal, like the other Member States of the European Union that are not part of the Mediterranean region, is not party to this regional convention or to any of the eight additional protocols."
"In accordance with Article 29 of the Barcelona Convention, a country must be party to the Convention in order to sign up to any of the Protocols."
"These regional initiatives include the United Nations strategy to implement the Montego Bay Convention (the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and are mirrored by the Lisbon Agreement to protect the Northeast Atlantic."
"Nevertheless, as everyone knows, the Lisbon Agreement has not entered into force because it has not been ratified by Spain and Morocco, as a result of the dispute over the delimitation of borders between these two countries."
". Parliament was asked to deliver an opinion on control measures applicable under the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries, ensuring a comprehensive monitoring and inspection scheme that will enable the resources in the area covered by this international convention to be exploited on a sustainable basis."
"With the Stevenson report now before us, Parliament urges the Commission to be more consistent in managing sustainable fisheries, and calls for a clarification of Community competences in the field of monitoring and inspection."
"The report also calls for more information to be provided on the costs of monitoring and inspection services operating in the Member States."
"The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in North-East Atlantic Fisheries (NEAFC) provides for a mechanism to ensure the monitoring and inspection of fishing grounds."
"The European Union chose to divide this task between the Commission and the Member States."
"In practice, however, this situation has led to problems in implementation, and to some constraints, which are to be expected when responsibilities are divided."
"Without completely rejecting the system chosen by the EU, Parliament must exert pressure to ensure a greater clarification of the competences of each party, the Commission on the one hand and the Member States on the other."
"One such clarification might involve creating a Community Inspection Agency."
"– Mrs Stihler, as this is a report that falls under Rule 110 (b) of the Rules of Procedure, the explanations of vote can in theory only be given in writing."
"Having, however, made the mistake of giving the floor to Mr Fatuzzo, who was in the same position as yourself, I am happy to give it to you."
"Mr President, with regard to the Kindermann report, many of my constituents are concerned about the unnecessary killing of dolphins and porpoises in Europe's seas."
"It is time for us to act swiftly."
"That is why the Kindermann report is so important."
"I am certain that these measures will make a real difference: a general restriction on the length of driftnets in the Baltic Sea from 1 July 2004, a further reduction in driftnet fishing by 1 January 2007; the compulsory use of acoustic deterrent devices and the introduction of a comprehensive system for monitoring the levels of dolphins and porpoises."
"These policies show why it is important to have a common fisheries policy and if these measures become part of that policy, we will then have the full force of the law across the 25 Member States."
"That shows just how important the EU and its enlargement into Eastern Europe are for all of us concerned about the environment."
". The aim of this regulation is to reduce the incidental catching of cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises in fishing nets, which is threatening the conservation of this species."
"There are insufficient data to enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of by-catches of cetaceans in fishing nets and of the impact of these catches on populations."
"There are, however, scientific papers proving that the majority of the fishing nets most commonly used in Europe are responsible for some cetacean by-catches."
"By establishing new measures designed to combat cetacean by-catches, this proposal for a regulation not only provides a response to the scientific papers but also makes a significant contribution to eradicating catches of cetaceans whose conservation would otherwise be threatened."
"Hence my vote in favour."
". I support this proposal for a regulation, which seeks to establish measures to combat the incidental catch of cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises, during fishing activities, with the corresponding amendment to Regulation (EC) 88/98."
"In fact, although the conservation of cetaceans is subject to protection under the 'Habitats' Directive, the measures contained therein have not proven sufficient to guarantee an appropriate level of protection."
"Because the most serious problems appear to be caused by gill-nets and drift nets, I believe it would be appropriate to lay down rules and limits on the use of these fishing techniques, and I therefore endorse the proposals tabled to this end."
"Nevertheless, and despite the findings of some existing scientific papers, I regret the fact that there are no more precise data that would enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of cetacean by-catches, and the European Union must strive to remedy this lack of information as a matter of urgency."
"We must, in fact, obtain reliable data on population units and on the incidental catches of cetaceans in various fishing grounds and at a later date, draw more wide-ranging conservation measures."
". I voted in favour of this Commission proposal, the aim of which is to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in an area north west of Scotland."
"Incorporating environmental requirements into the common fisheries policy also involves adopting measures designed to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems."
"Recent scientific reports have shown that some deep-sea habitats are in need of protection against mechanical erosion caused by fishing gear."
"I therefore support the Commission’s ban on using these drift-nets in the Darwin Mounds."
"Adopting this measure will bring substantial environmental benefits, without having a significant impact on the fisheries sector, because fishermen will be able to continue using drift-nets outside the fishing zone containing the Darwin Mounds, or, within the protected zone, using towed nets that do not come into contact with the seabed."
"The Attwooll report on the protection of the Darwin’s Mounds coral reefs from the effects of trawling has ceased to be so discriminatory and disproportionate in three crucial areas, thanks to the amendments that I tabled with the Committee on Fisheries and that have been adopted."
"The Commission wanted to ban recourse to deep-sea trawlers well beyond the area of distribution of the Darwin’s Mounds."
"The text now refers to the 2002 Advisory Committee on Ecosystems (ACE) report in order to define this area which, in fact, covers two distinct zones ten times less extensive than that defined by the Commission."
"Deep-sea trawlers were accused of systematically destroying the corals."
"It is now laid down that the measures provided for must relate exclusively – and avoiding any combination – to ‘fishinggear likely to cause real damage’."
"Finally, there is a demand for the interested parties and the regional advisory councilsrun by fishing professionals to participate in the decision-making process."
"The issue of the legal and economic uncertainty involved in the application of the Habitats Directive to European waters arises again, however, in connection with the Commission’s new bans on trawling in various sectors around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands."
"In the vision that I had, Mr President, Mr Pannella was condemned to go on strike about a hunger strike, that is to say he was condemned to eat, to eat and get fatter and fatter."
"Then Mr Pannella said to me: ‘Please wake up Mr Fatuzzo, for you it is a dream, you were dreaming, but for me it is a nightmare!’"
"I therefore had to vote in favour of the report so as to protect poor Mr Pannella."
". The outermost regions (ORs) have specific structural and socio-economic conditions, which can result in permanent economic handicaps, including economic dependence on a few products and limited access to markets."
"Their economic activities are based chiefly on tourism, agriculture and fisheries, which is the case of the Autonomous Region of the Azores and of Madeira."
"This own-initiative report, which I believe is broadly to be welcomed, is, therefore, important."
"I agree with the need to ensure that Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty constitutes the legal basis for all measures relating to the ORs, including the fisheries sector."
"I also agree on the importance of the compensation scheme for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products and with increasing the budget of the POSEI programmes."
"Aid must also be maintained for renewing and modernising the local fleet, for increasing the eligibility of new species and for fishermen’s active participation in the common fisheries policy."
"The most pressing requirement for maintaining the fisheries sector in the ORs, however, concerns the management of fishery resources, ensuring that only local fleets can fish in their exclusive economic zone, as the rapporteur advocates, to some extent, in paragraph 12."
"We must obtain detailed information on the state of fish resources in the ORs, particularly of Black Scabbardfish."
". This report is based on the premise that the common fisheries policy (CFP) does not pay due attention to the specific interests of the outermost regions."
"The rapporteur rightly believes that there is, in many ways, a conflict between the CFP on the one hand, which was planned with the interests of continental Europe in mind and which applies to the outermost regions because of their status as an integral part of the Community, and, on the other, the specific needs of the outermost regions which came into being as a result of their specific geographical, economic and social characteristics."
"It should be added that the reform of the CFP has also failed to take due account of the needs of the regions in question."
"In this context, we must establish a number of priorities reflected in various support measures, which warrant our attention."
"First of all, increasing the eligibility of new species of fish from the outermost regions and maintaining aid for the construction of new vessels after 2006."
"Next, increasing, as a matter of urgency, scientific research into fishery resources and finally creating fishing zones reserved exclusively for local fishermen."
"I have voted in favour in order to support this consistent policy, which seeks to meet the needs of the outermost regions."
". I agree with this own-initiative report that raises the issue of the impact of the common fisheries policy (CFP) on the EU’s outermost regions."
"As the rapporteur rightly points out, supported by Article 299(2) TEC, due to factors such as climate, topography, geographical location, small size, remoteness and economic dependence on a small number of products, the outermost regions have very specific structural, social and economic conditions."
"I therefore share the rapporteur’s opinion emphasising that adapting the CFP to the needs of these outermost regions must be done systematically and that defining a coherent and structured policy in this field is much-needed."
"Financial aid must be granted to those regions as a means of compensating for the additional costs incurred in marketing their fishery products and the funds that are provided should be better used."
"I also greatly welcome the idea of establishing a fishing observatory in each outermost region, both to supervise fishing activities and to ensure better protection of fish resources and the environment."
"Mr President, we are talking about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, one of the Members of which is, as you know, the Bahamas."
"In 1965 I found myself in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas; Paradise Island, a fairy tale place for tourists to the Bahamas."
"I was a little younger than I am toady; by the sea I met a young Bahamian who said to me: ‘I hear that you will become a Member of the European Parliament and I will be Co-Presidentof the Joint Parliamentary Assembly’."
"‘So, be sure’, I said to him, ‘to think about pensioners, also the pensioners of the Member States that you will represent, and remember to set up a Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment’."
"This is something that he did, and so I voted in favour."
"We have of course voted against the report on this so-called ACP (African-Caribbean-Pacific) – EU ‘Joint’ Parliamentary Assembly. This is just a pseudo-parliamentary front for unequal relations and, in fact, for the plundering of these regions of the developing world by the European imperialist powers."
". Like the rapporteur, I welcome the adoption and the implementation by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) of its amended Rules of Procedure, intended to streamline its activities."
"Particularly significant is the setting-up of three standing committees, which could help the Assembly to become a genuine parliamentary assembly."
"I believe the attention the JPA has paid to the rights of children and in particular to child soldiers, is to be lauded, as is the positive influence that its report had on this matter in the Council, which resulted in strategic guidelines being adopted on the unacceptable use of children in armed conflicts."
"I must, however, express my frustration at the JPA’s inability to exert any positive influence over the situation in Zimbabwe."
"The JPA must strive to be more effective and efficient in preventing conflicts, become more actively involved in monitoring electoral and democratisation processes and promote the involvement of civil society in the work of the Joint Assembly and its standing committees, particularly when the JPA meets in ACP countries."
"Despite my reservations arising from the conviction that the JPA could be more ambitious in these fields, I share the rapporteur’s view that these developments are broadly to be welcomed."
"I am therefore voting in favour."
"Yesterday, Mr President, I closed my eyes for a moment to think about how I should explain my vote in favour of the Bowis report on disease prevention and control."
"With my eyes closed, I saw that Mr Bowis, in the next legislative period, had become EU Commissioner for Health and, with his usual commitment and professional ability, had succeeded in obtaining a huge financial and organisational undertaking to prevent a good many diseases for EU citizens, thus reducing health expenditure across Europe, as well as disability pensions, without needing to reduce the budget for pensions and so harm pensioners."
"This is why – with the hope that this really happens– I voted in favour of his report."
"We Moderates believe it is one of the European Union’s tasks to prevent the outbreak of serious infectious diseases and, when they do occur, to coordinate the response."
"With freedom of movement within the EU and rapid ways of transmitting infections across its borders, a European Centre could quickly take action to reduce and limit the effects and spread of outbreaks of disease."
"We think it inappropriate to extend the Centre’s competence to include general public health issues."
"We believe that the Commission’s proposals on important points are better than the European Parliament’s proposals, which is why we choose to support the Commission’s proposals."
". I very much support the report by the rapporteur which sets out the need to set up a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control within the territories of the EU."
"This centre will be funded from the EU Budget and will come into existence next year."
"As we are aware there is an EU Communicable Diseases Network which has been in existence since 1999."
"It has acted as a channel for occasional cooperation between Member States when they take measures against epidemics and other health risks."
"An example of this would be the cooperation that was put in place for the different Member States of the EU concerning the fight against SARS last year."
"However, several studies have revealed the long-term limitations of this arrangement."
"We are aware that diseases such as AIDS, Malaria and Meningitis have no frontiers."
"They spread with increasing ease around the world as a result of population movements and the expansion of trade."
"The only concerted action by countries inside and outside the European Union can hope to check these dangers effectively."
"The aim of the new centre is to overcome the problems of the present arrangements and to develop and implement projects more coherently across the territories of what will be the 25 Member States of the EU."
". I congratulate Mr Bowis on his excellent report on the proposal for a Parliament and Council regulation establishing a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which has my support, especially as it is designed to improve communication, coordination and cooperation with the Dedicated Surveillance Networks."
"Establishing a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will enable the EU to draw up a long-term plan for Public Health, to respond quickly to epidemics and to react effectively to any potential outbreak or other incident, without teams in different Member States duplicating work."
". I believe that communicable diseases constitute an extremely serious threat to the health of citizens and therefore support the Commission proposal to increase the means to effectively control such diseases, specifically by creating a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which would bring together epidemiologists, public health experts, microbiologists, logistics specialists and doctors."
"The European Union must strive to improve cooperation and coordination between Member States in monitoring diseases."
"The case of the atypical pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus demonstrated the need for this."
"It is thus crucial to create synergies between national disease control centres, ensuring epidemiological surveillance, creating laboratory networks, issuing scientific advice and having a body that can provide, at European level, an Early Warning and Response System, also providing the necessary technical assistance and information on threats to health and preparing for health emergencies."
"I agree with the suggestion that this centre must have a contingency budget to allow it to address unforeseeable situations."
"This centre must be created around the Community Communicable Diseases Network that comprises designated national bodies responsible for communicable diseases within Member States."
"I voted in favour."
"Mr President, one of the reasons why we abstained in the vote on this motion for a resolution was because we did not find the slightest mention in it of the grave discrimination contained in the Slovenian legislation on compensation – legislation that penalises refugees and their children for the terrible events that took place in the post-war period in these countries."
"Today, 10 February, is the second time that a day of remembrance has been celebrated in our country."
"On behalf, too, of a Member here today, the MEP Mr Gobbo, I would like to mention the flight of 350 000 of our compatriots that were driven out of their countries and, above all, the sacrifice and the tragedy of the more than 10 000 people thrown – in many case when still alive – into caves and ditches in these countries: a tragedy affecting the Istrian, Giuliano-Dalmatian and Fiumano peoples and which is still present in the lived experience and the suffering of these lands; a tragedy that Europe too should remember and commemorate."
"It is another holocaust that calls to mind the tragedies of totalitarianism of the last century."
". We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion for a resolution on the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights because, generally speaking, the resolution proclaims the ΕU to be the 'honest' judge of respect for human rights but says nothing about the blatant violations of human rights within the ΕU: persecution of trade unionists, electronic files, monitoring personal life on the pretext of combating terrorism, infringement of the rights to housing and work and equal access to health care, education and social welfare, taking away physical integrity and life in the workplace for greater profit etc."
"And:"
"- the resolution criticises the Commission on Human Rights for becoming highly politicised, obviously implying that the refusal by the majority of its members to satisfy the demands of the ΕU and the USA to condemn states and precisely serving their ideological and political expediencies (Cuba, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Belarus etc.);"
"- it avoids firing on the USA, where executions and blatant violations of human rights are a daily occurrence;"
"- it proposes a 'fair' trial for Saddam Hussein, while not only does it not propose a trial for Bush, Blair and their accomplices, it also proclaims them as guarantors of justice;"
"- human rights are again being 'exploited' to pave the way for the CFSP, in other words military intervention."
". The question of human rights is one to which we could never be indifferent, yet this does not give us the right to give lessons on human rights."
"It does, however, give us sufficient moral authority to refuse to accept other people’s criteria for determining whether behaviour in the area of human rights is good or bad."
"Our abstention, far from being tantamount to indifference, is intended to show how important the question of human rights is to us and how we do not accept the approval of resolutions that are based on market ideology and related concepts, in which certain countries are mentioned and certain others not, in which there appear to be favourite sons and black sheep... whereas there are no prodigal sons – perish the thought! – in the field of competitiveness and productivity."
"We similarly refuse to accept the smokescreen of compensation, in which the inclusion of some makes up for mere reference to others."
"This explains our vote."
". The British Conservative delegation strongly supports genuine human rights and the need for the UN Commission on Human Rights to take a robust position to overcome abuses in many parts of the world."
"We therefore welcomed many aspects of the resolution, not least the concern expressed at the lack of action over Zimbabwe."
"However, we do not support the one-sided statement regarding the situation in the Middle East which makes no mention of the appalling terrorism against Israelis; the unrealistic and broadly unsympathetic attitude to strong counter-terrorist measures; or indeed the unquestioning approval of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"We therefore abstained on this resolution."
"Mr President, Mr Katiforis presents a report on the role and methods of rating agencies."
"Also in this case, when I closed my eyes, I saw Mr Katiforis who was running and running and was breathless."
"‘Where are you running?’ I asked him."
"He said ‘I am running so that I arrive to present my report before the collapse of Parmalat in Italy."
"Fatuzzo, you know Mr Mennea."
"Tell him to get the rating report because he will certainly run faster than me, being a Moscow Olympic runner, and he will, therefore, get to present it and get it adopted before Parmalat collapses’."
"I am sorry to say that this was a dream that has not been realised: Mr Katiforis did not manage to get to present his report and have it adopted before the sad event of the Parmalat Bond collapse."
"."
"Recent financial scandals, such as Enron and Parmalat, are further evidence of the consequences of liberalising capital markets and the role of the rating agencies that gave the creditworthiness of these giant transnationals a clean bill of health, even though they did not disclose any information on their activities."
"This was only allowed to happen because the rating agencies are a product of the private sector, a self-regulating product of the market that creates mechanisms to assess the creditworthiness of entities that finance themselves by collecting money from third parties, such as companies that float on the stock market and even States, in terms of issuing public debt."
"Rating agencies wield great power in the financial market, since rating is a legal condition of eligibility for investment portfolios."
"Additionally, the ratings ‘market’ is highly concentrated and the biggest agencies, two of which have their headquarters in the USA – one gave Parmalat a positive rating – operate an oligarchy."
"As a self-regulating instrument of regulation, the rating agencies serve to extend the liberalisation of the capital markets."
"In order to make them an essential regulating body, they would have to be regulated by public bodies within the framework of national legislation and jurisprudence."
"The report manages to ask questions and make diagnoses, but does not prescribe any medicine, which only serves to encourage these self-regulating instruments."
"The question is more political than technical, and, politically speaking, the end-product justifies our vote against."
"Knowing that I was to vote on the activities of public utilities in developing countries – and I said I would vote in favour – many pensioners that were listening to me in Milan, last Saturday, urged me to discuss the possibility of ensuring that, in European Union interventions in developing countries on issues of public services, pension systems in the said countries are improved, given that we are not managing to give more to pensioners in Italy and in Europe, nor, in particular, to do our best to ensure that widows have 100% of the pensions of their late spouses and that all those that work have 120% of their final salaries."
"– The rapporteur acknowledges that the privatisation of state-owned enterprises and of public services in poor countries – privatisation desired and imposed by big Western investors and by the states that defend their interests – has helped increase poverty in the developing countries."
"Now that the European Commission, which is among the guarantors of the interests of big European investors, seems to be advocating more diversified forms of privatisation in these poor countries, to their disadvantage, the rapporteur openly backs its recommendations."
"Well, we, on the other hand, do not."
"We are, on principle, opposed to the open or creeping privatisation of public services, for it leads, always and everywhere, to a deterioration in the populations’ living conditions."
"In poor countries, this drastic impairment of peoples’ conditions of life, and even of survival, is all the more appalling in that, as the rapporteur acknowledges, it is aimed at depriving what are already some of the most destitute peoples on the planet of the very little that they have, a process that is to the sole benefit of the Western multinationals which, for their part, make more profit than they can cope with."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
".– To economists, major profit-making international businesses, based in Europe, America or Japan, are often the benchmark for the developing countries, which would automatically prosper if those businesses were given the freedom to take over loss-making activities and export raw materials."
"This assumption is short-sighted."
"For centuries, the economy in those countries was controlled by the north, as a result of which they were forced to produce cheap products for the market of rich countries, to the detriment of their domestic economy and the provision of services to their own people."
"To a large extent, following the removal of colonial government, they have themselves had to develop and extend provision in the fields of education, health care, public transport, house building, postal services, electricity, drinking water, telephone and sewage."
"Generally high development costs and low profit expectations have meant those sectors did not initially appeal to foreign private companies."
"Moreover, we saw that, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the early development of industry in Japan was possible only thanks to state-owned companies that were privatised only after they had become profitable."
"That is why it was useful that the Committee on Development and Cooperation not only considered privatisation and full liberalisation but also the provision of services, poverty reduction, small businesses, cooperatives and a sustainable role for government initiatives."
"It is lamentable that today’s plenary has seen the Christian Democrats standing in the way of a majority for these instruments against poverty and underdevelopment."
". The rapporteur’s endeavours in this apparent ‘mission impossible’ to give words their real meanings is worthy of praise."
"The term ‘cooperation’means supporting the development of companies in third countries, as suggested in the title of the first communication that laid the basis for the report; it also means reforming State-owned companies, which are the basis of public services in these countries, and the need to assess all possible solutions, as suggested in the title of the second."
"Such support is, however, straitjacketed by the predominant concept of companies that can only be regulated by the market, which has adopted the predominant strategy of structural adjustments, the predominant solution to which is to dismantle and privatise public services."
"The rapporteur questioned ideological concepts and raised questions from a perspective that was not strictly commercial."
"It is significant that he referred to the water supply and drainage, to education and to health services, which, in his opinion, should fall within the competences of the State and local authorities."
"For local investors and SMUs, in the case of privatisation, to proceed as a matter of priority with the proposal that each TNC should commit as a minimum investment 0.7% of its gross turnover or 5% of its net profit into new investments, as Offset projects in these countries each year, in the context in which we live, is verging on provocation."
"This is how this report was greeted by political forces that felt threatened by the presence of a rapporteur tabling alternatives to improve what had appeared incurable."
"All the Christian Democratic proposals by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats having been, in principle, adopted in plenary, thereby considerably improving the content of the report, I have voted in favour of the latter in the final vote."
"The fight against poverty is the main objective of EU development policy."
"History shows that state monopolies have often led to economic inefficiency, mismanagement, corruption and injustice in developing countries."
"Particularly in the case of services for the benefit of everyone, such as the supply of water and energy, together with education and health, the state sector has failed in the majority of these countries."
"Reforms in this sector can therefore contribute to improvements and growth."
"Through a number of amendments by ourselves in the PPE-DE Group, this is clearly shown by the report."
"The report is therefore in line with the Commission’s assessment that the fight against poverty can only seriously be taken up through the objective consideration of all the alternatives for reform with a view to increasing economic growth and countering corruption."
"Monopoly situations, be they public or private, must be replaced by competition and diversity with a view to increased fairness and better economic management."
"Clear legal framework regulations must stand as guarantees of the right to services for the benefit of all."
"Small enterprises can operate as important engines of growth in the developing countries and should therefore be supported financially and through technical aid."
". Delays have occurred in transposing this directive into national law in some Member States, which shows the problems that its implementation has generated, particularly in industry."
"This has led the Commission to embark upon a wide-ranging consultation process with all those concerned."
"We will not know, therefore, about the actual transposition of the Directive until Member States have submitted their national reports."
"Although the directive has been in force since October 1999, in new installations and existing installations where the operator intends to carry out significant changes, a transitional period has been granted until October 2007, which requires special support to be granted to industrial SMEs and to farmers."
"The integrated prevention and control of pollution, which is the aim of this directive, can be achieved with a permit system for installations, which we welcome."
"Different circumstances must, however, be taken into account and the most contentious areas of the directive must be clarified, in order that we find acceptable solutions."
". I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Ever since the Gothenburg Summit the EU has been proposing ‘sustainable development’, which is the only guarantee of human development that deems respect for the environment as an essential prerequisite for rapid progress."
"I therefore consider it to be extremely important that we proceed responsibly – as in the question before us today – towards implementing and transposing directives that lay down this intention in law."
"Concepts such as ‘cross-compliance’ in the technical conditions of operating licences, sharing best practices and defining best available techniques (BATs), are just some of the ways in which we can ensure the integrated prevention and reduction of pollution resulting from a wide range of industrial and agricultural activities, and in which we can reach a higher level of environmental protection."
"Within the framework of the 1996 Directive under consideration, a system of permits for new installations is established, which forces operators to adopt pollution prevention measures."
"It also urges all installations to comply with the same rules from 2007 onwards."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she stresses the importance of forcing Member States to present their plans for assessing transposition (also by 2007) as soon as possible."
"For this purpose, a ‘Guidance Document’ clarifying the definition of ‘installation’ and other key terms would be most helpful …"
"The ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) operates today as an important independent organisation, based on national research institutions."
"There is therefore no reason for the EU to seek membership and appoint people to work in the ICES."
"Firstly, it would place a question mark over both the ICES’s and the Commission’s independence, since the Commission is the main user of the ICES’s results."
"Secondly, there is a limited number of qualified researchers."
"If the Commission is to appoint researchers to this task, it will lead to a drain on the national institutions, for the simple reason that the Commission pays better."
"The June Movement’s three Members of the European Parliament, Ulla Sandbæk, Jens-Peter Bonde and Bent Hindrup Andersen, chose to vote against the report, a decision for which the following explanation of vote was given."
"In principle, the June Movement believes that all attempts by the EU to dominate the ICES should be voted down."
"This ought to be a national concern."
"The June Movement believes it would be better if the EU were to call upon the nation states to increase their scientific capacity in relation to the ICES and, if need be, to coordinate research efforts in the area."
". In order to ensure the sustainability of fisheries resources, it is important that we are provided with detailed information and credible scientific opinions regarding the current state and ongoing development of these resources."
"The overriding concern is reliability of information, which has often been called into question, thereby creating unwanted tension between investigators, scientists and fishermen."
"There are therefore two crucial issues:"
"- The first entails fishermen taking an active role in the management of fishing effort and participating in the evaluation of studies into resources in conjunction with investigators and scientists."
"Fishermen have the most to gain from the sustainability of resources and from stock recovery measures."
"It is therefore important that we create suitable bodies that enable effective communication between all those concerned;"
"- The second entails a thorough evaluation of the socio-economic impact of stock recovery measures or measures aimed at reducing the fishing effort."
"The implementation of these measures, which is sometimes voluntary on the part of the fishermen, as happens in Portugal in the case of sardines, requires compensation at public, national and Community level."
"It is also necessary to increase EU funding in research in the fisheries sector and to create the material and human conditions required to improve scientific advice."
". Scientific research has become an essential instrument in implementing the common fisheries policy and is crucial to the sustainable management of resources."
"The limits placed on fishing in the EU have had devastating socio-economic consequences."
"Portugal has been particularly hard hit by such measures, especially in the conversion of activities and in the destruction of large parts of the national fishing fleet."
"I see the consequences of fisheries management measures every day in the ports and fish markets of my region and I am furious that the Commission continues to pursue the same policy, without having any evaluation carried out into the socio-economic impact of implementing these measures."
"It is therefore important that these special arrangements, given their irreversibility, are duly justified in thorough scientific reports containing highly credible information on the development of resources."
"Given the lack of objective information, current scientific reports give rise to conflicting interpretations on the part of Member States, thereby counteracting the effects of measures to protect fisheries resources."
"I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the work of the rapporteur."
"I share his concern about the lack of scientific advice on fishing, and about the scarcity of financial and human resources."
"I also endorse the need to strengthen the ties between science and industry, thus giving the final results greater practicability."
". The report drawn up by Mr Lage addresses the important question of the credibility of scientific opinions used in fisheries management, given the frequent differences of opinion between scientists and fishermen regarding the current state of fisheries resources."
"EU measures based on scientific advice can have a devastating impact on fishing communities."
"It is in this light that we see the importance of this issue and the need to improve the quality of this advice."
"Mr Lage’s warning therefore gives the Community the opportunity to base the common fisheries policy on more accurate, more timely advice, thereby leading to a stronger scientific basis than has thus far been detected."
"It is unacceptable that we continue to see the ‘Commission’s apparent unwillingness’, as Mr Lage puts it, to have regard to all the scientific advice available."
"This only serves to increase suspicion of bias in their decisions, which tend to overlook fishing communities that are already completely unprotected."
"My vote in favour of this report is, therefore, also an expression of solidarity with Portuguese fishermen, who have been so severely affected by the Commission’s – and in particular Commissioner Fischler’s – Fisheries Policy."
"– The Lage report rightly emphasises that the management measures adopted by the European Union are too often based upon faulty and unreliable scientific diagnoses."
"The socio-economic consequences of management measures adopted on such a flimsy basis are considerable: it is the very survival of entire fisheries and, indeed, entire industries that is at stake."
"The scientific effort must therefore be increased and relate both to the biology of marine environments and to the selection of fishing gear, as well as to the socio-economic consequences of the measures for managing the resource."
"The current imbalance in the CFP, which does not take overall account of the joint objectives of conserving the resource and ensuring the continuity of fisheries, must definitely be corrected."
"To this end, the future Regional Advisory Councils will have to play an absolutely key role in formulating requests for scientific advice."
"They will have to request a range of management options, accompanied by estimates of their biological and socio-economic consequences."
"Such a development should permit an approach that is no longer brutal and irreversible but gradual, progressive, flexible and continuously adaptable."
"I am pleased that it has been possible to adopt the amendments I had tabled along those lines."
"That concludes the voting."
"(1)"
"We shall now continue the item which was interrupted, which is the debate on the report (A5-0022/2004) by Mr Garot, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the development of agricultural incomes in the European Union (2002/2258(INI))."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying how appalled I am that Commissioner Fischler is not here."
"This simply defies belief, given the importance of the debate."
"Farmers have a right to decent incomes."
"The guarantee of profitable producer prices must, therefore, be the guiding premise of the common agricultural policy, in order to ensure farmers a decent standard of living on a par with other sectors of activity."
"This will in turn ensure that agricultural activity is sustained throughout EU territory."
"While these aims are enshrined in the CAP, the mechanisms of the policy – placing emphasis on reducing producer prices and on liberalising the agriculture markets both externally and internally – are entirely at variance with them."
"We know that this policy has been responsible for the disappearance of thousands of agricultural holdings and jobs, promoting the concentration, intensification and verticalisation of production, the centralisation of land ownership and the growing rural exodus."
"It has, furthermore, exacerbated the injustice of the uneven allocation of agricultural production aid among producers, production and countries."
"It is this model that, twelve years after the 1992 CAP reform, perpetuates the profound injustice that 20% of the major holdings receive 80% of aid."
"In Portugal, 1% of the major holdings receive almost half of this aid, a situation that we have always contested."
"The current reform of the CAP, with the decoupling of production aid based on historical references, perpetuates this imbalance."
"The decision not to proceed with genuine modulation and the establishment of aid limits was something of a missed opportunity."
"Aid should not be simply a matter of transferring money to rural development, but should instead act to offset the profound inequalities in the distribution of aid among farmers and countries."
"It is also important to point out that reduced prices of products and increased production costs, even taking into account the partial compensation of production aid, led to the disappearance of around 16% of agricultural holdings between 1995 and 2002."
"Not that consumers saw the benefits of these price reductions."
"The consumer price index rose, in fact, during the period concerned by around 11%, while the producer price index fell by more than 1%."
"A determining – and worrying – factor in this situation is the gradual deregulation of the CAP’s market mechanisms, in addition to the fact that these mechanisms discriminate between continental and Mediterranean production."
"In view of the volatility and uniqueness of the agriculture sector, effective mechanisms must be introduced to regulate the market and to stabilise supply, so as to guarantee farm incomes."
"It is also important, as the rapporteur advocates, that we provide adequate external protection for agriculture and that we create Community mechanisms enabling us to intervene in any disaster that may befall the sector."
"We also feel that rural development should be strengthened, yet this would entail increasing the agriculture budget, not freezing it until 2013, as decided at the Copenhagen Council."
"Increasing the agriculture budget would make it possible to offer compensation to farmers in the least-favoured regions or to those on lower incomes."
"This is essential if we are to maintain multifunctional agriculture and high quality farm produce."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Garot is plausible and realistic and, therefore, positive, even if not all of the figures that he reports relate to the different types of agriculture that we have in the Union; for example, the 7% increase in income and the 15.7% decrease in the number of farms does not correspond to hill and mountain farming, where the figures are, unfortunately, very different: only a 1% increase in income, but more than 25% of farms are abandoned."
"I would therefore like to mention that hill and mountain farming does not represent a secondary aspect of European agriculture as a whole: it covers 20% of the useful agricultural area and 30% of land; and 5% of European citizens live in mountain areas."
"Leaving the mountains not only has economic but, as we know, also social and environmental effects."
"Leaving the mountains means endangering a whole system, the hydrogeological balance and the control of forest expansion. It means putting an end to every type of agro-tourism, which would lead to repercussions for valley areas too."
"What are the possible solutions?"
"To allow fixed and suitable compensation for hill and mountain farmers that takes account of the commitment to multifunctional agriculture; and to launch a specific but comprehensive policy for mountain areas that, for the most disadvantaged areas too, guarantees services and aid to improve the general quality of life and not, therefore, just the economic level of those who choose to live there."
"The strong push towards rural development – shown in the recent reform of the CAP – gives some guarantee, but it is not enough."
"The specific nature of mountain areas needs to be explicitly recognised in the Treaties and in structural measures, and we need to have the courage to act with determination to overcome, as far as possible, the restrictions of State aid."
"Mr President, this area is extremely complex, but it is most important that we address it to ensure the continuing viability of our farms and rural areas."
"Comparisons of farm income can be very difficult: they depend on the base year used – 1995 in this case – and the figures vary depending on whether you take an aggregate, a family, a household or an individual measure."
"We must compare like with like."
"Irish aggregate farm income increased by 2.2% in 2003 to EUR 2.524 billion, and estimated direct payments of EUR 1.6 billion accounted for 64% of this figure."
"Our farm survey shows that the average family farm income fell by 5.8% in 2002 to EUR 14 900."
"There are large variations, depending on the size of the farm and the system of farming."
"For instance, in 2002 average farm family income on the 40% of farms classified as full-time was EUR 27 760."
"On the 60% of farms classified as part-time, the income was only EUR 6 590."
"However, farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified."
"The 1999-2000 household budget survey shows that almost 60% of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources, contributing to the future viability of many farms."
"On the average farm income in the EU in 2003, we ranked eighth."
"According to the most recent Eurostat estimate, average income per full-time job equivalent, adjusted to inflation, fell by 0.6% in Ireland in 2003, compared to an average increase of 0.9% in the EU as a whole."
"The distribution of direct payments in Ireland may be more equitable than in other EU countries, as there are relatively few very large farms, particularly arable farms."
"While the top 20% in the EU receive 73% of direct aid, our farm survey shows that approximately 40% of payments went to the 20% of farmers with the highest family farm income."
"The concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling."
"Public intervention in agricultural insurance systems would lead to cherry-picking by the private sector, and the European Union could be left covering the highest or uninsurable risks, which would be very expensive and lead to considerable budgetary problems."
"I welcome the reduced rate of modulation agreed by the Council."
"A higher rate would mean a higher cut in direct payments and therefore in farm incomes."
"Before any rate is decided on, the first step should be to evaluate the Community's rural development needs, cost them and then set the appropriate rate to meet the cost."
"I am opposed to a major redistribution of direct payments, as suggested."
"The purpose of the mid-term review reform is to promote competitiveness while securing the income of farmers in a situation where payments would no longer be coupled to production."
"I have always supported the concept of decoupling."
"The aim is to avoid a major disturbance of production patterns and land values."
"Farmers have established entitlements and any redistribution would lead to losses and gains."
"Redistribution would also impact on production decisions by farmers, whereas the intention was to respond to market signals rather than force change upon them because of a fundamental change in the level of support."
"The CAP reform has changed the policy framework to ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry."
"The options for decoupling direct payments will allow these payments to be made safe from WTO challenges and so protect their contribution to farm incomes and to the rural economy."
"Mr President, as regards the economic aspect, I can only congratulate Mr Garot on his articulate and accurate report."
"It is a report, which, not least, rekindles some of the issues and questions that we have put to the Commission during the current term: for example, the establishment of sectoral contracts to increase the level of quality, if necessary, but in any case to guarantee quality in agriculture; access to the European market for products from third countries that are subject to the same standards as European products; and a crisis management system."
"Furthermore, the report calls for consideration of the fact that the reduction and the fall in agricultural prices has not in fact had any effect on consumption."
"Having said that, however, and at a purely theoretical level – and all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development know my position as regards the proposal for mid-term revision – I believe that we have taken on a huge responsibility, the effects of which we will be able to analyse only in a few years’ time, since the formula chosen for regulating the markets and stabilising prices – aid for production that is direct, fixed and de-coupled – will lead us to gradually dismantle the agricultural sector."
"We made choices based on a vision rather than on a foreign policy as regards Cancún."
"We have seen the results of Cancún, and we have seen how the talks at Geneva have been resumed."
"Among other things, I believe that some figures in the Garot report – the 7% increase in agricultural prices from 1995 to 2002 – refer to historical prices and do not, for example, take into account the inflation rate that has a marked effect upon agricultural prices."
"The whole of the agricultural situation projected until 2011 in the European Union is, in my opinion, very much more sensitive, and with much more complicated rules, than the situation presented by Mr Garot."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me too start by thanking Mr Garot for his own-initiative report."
"Income policy in the agricultural sector has a direct influence on the attractiveness of the farming life, and consequently on the continuation of agricultural production; connected with the effect it has on rural development."
"Europe’s farmers enjoy very widely differing levels of income."
"In recent years, agriculture has had to cope with profound structural change, and that is not yet over."
"Between 1995 and 2002 alone, the number of farms in the EU has decreased by an average of 15.7%."
"European farmer’s income consists in part of direct payments and not merely of production yield; moreover, the fall in prices for basic agricultural produce bears no relation to the way the prices paid by consumers for food have changed."
"In future, too, production costs will increase as a result of the greater demands made of agriculture, while farmers’ compensation payments will not be increased correspondingly."
"What compensation payments must do is to guarantee that society’s needs are met: the desire for healthy and safe food and for an environment fit to live in."
"Compensation payments for agriculture are justified insofar as they reward its multifunctional services to society, above all – as Mr Santini said – in the mountainous, less-favoured, and peripheral regions of the EU."
"The European Union’s agriculture will also need a strong dose of entrepreneurship and an underlying production role."
"Farmers’ understanding of their own occupational role and their social status increasingly depend on to what extent the agricultural policy promotes farming enterprise."
"It is at this that the individual instruments must be targeted, but the common agricultural policy must not permit the first pillar to be played against the second."
"Nor may we disregard the requirement that these agricultural policy instruments be provided over a specified period, thus making it possible to plan and act within a longer timeframe."
"There is no getting away from the Financial Perspective as a means of giving our farmers, to some extent, the certainty they need in order to plan ahead, which agriculture and rural areas need."
"Mr President, a sincere thank-you to Mr Garot for a constructive report that is very good at depicting today’s agricultural economy."
"Agricultural economics is a very important subject for the development of thriving rural areas."
"Thriving rural areas are entirely dependent upon the existence of profitable farms."
"In a Europe in which 50% of farmers are over 55 years of age and only eight per cent under 35, a whole new attitude to agriculture’s entrepreneurs is required."
"If I were now asked to give advice to people who had recently started up a farm, I would reply that they should make their financial calculations without reference to funding by society and not rely upon the good will of politicians."
"The report contains a number of points I cannot support."
"For example, it talks about ensuring ‘a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and stabilis[ing] incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the European Union’."
"A second point emphasises the importance of ‘maintain[ing] the level of public support for agriculture’ and the significance of creating ‘conditions that will guarantee employment’ and so forth. If these sentences, worded as they are, were read out to today’s farmers, they would leave them cold."
"In a country like Sweden, these words do not correspond to reality."
"Only 0.5 per cent of the population are now farmers."
"Restructuring is taking place incredibly quickly."
"The mid-term review has meant that everything has stopped, apart from the running down of agriculture."
"That is not of course something that can be blamed solely upon the European Community."
"A lot of the blame lies, for example, with the Swedish Government."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wachtmeister."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
".Successful – that is, profitable – agriculture is an essential part of the rural economy and a major influence on the viability of basic rural services, from schools to post offices."
"Many agri-businesses in Scotland are facing major pressure on net incomes."
"In addition to the farm-gate price pressures which all farmers face, Scots producers, especially those in Highland and Island areas, have to cope with high costs of transportation and other challenges such as climatic conditions."
"Scots food producers must be encouraged by the new CAP to capitalise on their already good reputation for natural production methods and resulting production of good quality and healthy foodstuffs, which consumers will want to choose."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0018/2004) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on agriculture and agricultural research in the framework of CAP reform (2003/2052(INI))."
". – Mr President, I believe that this report, with the short debate on it that is shortly to follow, fits in well with what we have been discussing: not only avian influenza, but also Mr Garot’s report, which has shed light on the difficulties faced by European agriculture, whilst also stressing its significance by reason of the multifunctional role given to it and in view of the status of agriculture as a dominant factor in the overall ecological and social balance of agricultural landscapes."
"Consideration must be given to why it is that agriculture is in such a difficult position in this respect, even though the European Union is one of the areas importing the most agricultural produce and food."
"Why – for this is the theme of the report – does the Sixth Research Framework Programme allocate only 5% of its funds to agriculture?"
"This does not do justice to the importance of agriculture, and it must also be noted that the research into agriculture announced in this Framework Programme is to a large extent aimed at rationalising production rather than at the sustainability issue."
"Take the problem of genetically modified organisms, for example: although it must be admitted that a vast amount is spent on genetic engineering, little is being done as regards coexistence and the sustainable and long-term cultivation of crops that have been genetically modified alongside those that have not."
"Let me return, though, to this morning’s consideration of avian influenza."
"We cannot fail to notice that, in the countries where it occurs, certain breeds adapted to industrial production are in conflict with the traditional and indigenous breeds."
"The former have developed an immune system that can deal with certain diseases, but now have to contend with genetic defects capable of affecting the immune system of the indigenous breeds."
"As a result, this is where the pandemics then strike, and the indigenous breeds are culled – that is, destroyed – so that these countries’ genetic resources, vital above all for their subsistence farming and food sources, suffer as well."
"The question must be asked – and this would be quite a research topic – why these industries go to these countries in the first place."
"Do they do it in order to sort out the problem with hunger that exists there, or do they do it because of better production conditions and opportunities to make a better return on the capital they invest?"
"Look into the situation and you will discover that neither these industries nor their capital generally belong to these countries; instead, the capital originates here, here in the industrial nations, which want to do business there, and then we in this House lament – as does Mr Garot in his report – that our agriculture is producing less."
"It is no longer competitive, because these countries work to different social, environmental and hygienic standards."
"Comparative studies of that would be extraordinarily important."
"I have mentioned subsistence farming, which is an important source of food not only in these countries, but also in the EU’s new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe."
"This is something else into which research should be done."
"In this report, we have attached the utmost importance to the question of the role played by women in the work done."
"Most women working in industrialised farming work in less-valued jobs, whereas, in other fields of agricultural activity, they tend to play leading roles on which the maintenance of these landscapes depends."
"The point we are generally trying to make is that we expect more attention to be given to agriculture when preparing the next – that is, the Seventh – Research Framework Programme, and that the expected results of agricultural reforms in the European Union and of changes elsewhere in the world should be accompanied by research that will provide us with insights as to what the direction of our policies should be in the coming years and decades."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for this report and also thanking the Members of your House for the initiative they have taken."
"The Commission welcomes this report, which we see as a good basis on which to prepare the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development, and as something of which it can make use."
"As you are aware, the decoupled payments under the new common agricultural policy will enable farmers not only to become more competitive, but also to respond better to the market’s requirements."
"This is where research can also make an essential contribution to improvement, by helping to develop more efficient production processes, by means of diversification and by introducing new and competitive crops."
"It can also help enable farmers to fulfil the demands of what we term cross-compliance, and, above all, to provide a sound scientific basis for our understanding of good agricultural and environmental practice, that is, of what is meant by a healthy condition."
"What the regions want and need is set out in the rural development programmes, in which local stakeholders, civil society and the scientific community must also be involved."
"That was one of the conclusions reached at last year’s conference in Salzburg."
"Let me now briefly address some of the statements and recommendations made in the report."
"Although it is quite clear that the sustainability of agriculture must be one of the priorities of research policy, the content of the Sixth Framework Programme has already largely been laid down, and only minor changes can be made to the annual work programmes, so we have to devote a great deal of attention to preparations for the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The Commission gives priority to research into alternative production methods and sources of income in rural areas, as well as to the endeavour to get away from the piecemeal approach in favour of research into the whole chain – in a sense, from the farm to the table."
"Issues of the safety and quality of food continue to play a very special part in this."
"It is also important that the public be involved in debates about research, and that the results should be evaluated."
"These considerations prompted the organisation of the conference ‘Science at the service of society’ on14 and 15 October 2002, and a second conference on this subject will be held in February 2005."
"Research into improved marker vaccines must be extended to include other diseases on list A, although budget limits must of course be adhered to."
"The same applies to research into medicines for minor species and into plant protection products for plants that are not widely cultivated."
"In both these areas there is the ever-worsening problem of dwindling interest on the part of private-sector researchers, it being apparent that profits will not be as high as they would be if large quantities of medicines or plant protection products were involved."
"This, I believe, is where the public sector has a contribution to make."
"I also share the view that social and environmental research into sustainable development in rural areas has to be stepped up, and that there is a particular need for research that is capable of supporting women in their roles in rural development – something that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned earlier."
"Although the subsidiarity principle must not be lost sight of, I do share the view that ‘on-farm’ research needs to be encouraged, with the accent on suitable farming methods and diversification."
"Prioritised under the heading of ‘Scientific Support to Policies’, research is already being done into the utilisation of agricultural raw materials."
"As its predecessors did, the current Framework Programme funds projects in the field of environmentally-friendly cultivation and related to low-cost farming methods, although it must be remembered in this context that, particularly when we are in the middle of a WTO negotiating round, there is also a need to produce research material relevant to international issues and, in particular, also to issues relating to developing countries."
"I would not wish to conclude this speech without mentioning the fact that we must not simply ignore research into biotechnology, for it is another area in which we can expect results of potential use to us in the agricultural sphere, provided that sufficiently intensive research is carried out."
"Overall, the Commission acknowledges the importance of Parliament’s report and also the need for a communication on the future direction, structure and promotion of agricultural research in Europe, which it will also produce."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf very warmly for producing this own-initiative report."
"The Commissioner’s remarks confirm how important this initiative is."
"The sixth framework programme for research currently has a budget of around EUR 16 billion, of which a maximum of 2% may be allocated to agriculture and rural development."
"This very welcome own-initiative report calls for an increase in the funding allocated to agricultural research from the EU’s research budget."
"We have made a clear decision in favour of the European model of agriculture, which means that we are committed to maintaining multifunctional and sustainable farming in all regions of Europe."
"Further development and research are inextricably linked."
