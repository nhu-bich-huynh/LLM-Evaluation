"Subject: Equal opportunities for older workers in recruitment to the European Commission"
"The reports of the Commissioner's recent change in view in his intended removal of age limits in recruitment notices for the European Commission are most welcome and we look forward to this policy taking effect in 1998."
"In the framework of inter-institutional cooperation for EU recruitment competitions, will the Commission be encouraging other EU institutions to follow its own example, once this becomes official Commission policy?Question No 32 by Elly Plooij-van Gorsel (H-0937/97)"
"Subject: EU action to remove age limits in recruitment"
"The Commission's recent announcement of the removal of age limits in recruitment notices for the European Commission follows closely the recent publication of draft legislation in the Netherlands to ban all reference to age in job advertisements."
"Does the Commission expect legal actions to be undertaken against other institutions, on the basis of the non-discrimination clause in the Treaty of Amsterdam or of national anti-age discrimination legislation in, for example, the Netherlands, if they continue to set age limits for recruitment?"
"Mr President, in January I am presenting for debate the proposal that would abolish age limits in recruitment advertisements for the Commission."
"If the Commission approves the proposal, age limits will vanish from any competitions from then on."
"As for current or future practice concerning other institutions, discussions are under way within the normal Community frameworks."
"That is why I do not wish to comment on any possible future arrangements or any legal matters pertaining to them."
"I thank the Commissioner for taking this matter up and for acting so efficiently and effectively."
"Could I make the point that he might consider in the discussions with the other institutions, pointing out to them that they must try and live up to the spirit and practice of the Amsterdam Treaty, particularly those aspects dealing with discrimination in employment."
"I refer in particular to the institution of which we are Members, because it appears to be one of the most laggard in retaining the archaic practice of ageism in employment."
"Would he take the opportunity then in the discussions that are going on - and we know it is a delicate matter - of pointing out that the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty demands that all European institutions set an example for other Community citizens?"
"We have informed the other institutions, including the European Parliament, of our intentions."
"Perhaps you also have possibilities to express your views in this procedure."
"We in the Commission came to the conclusion in the preparatory discussions that any age limit in the publication of a post would be very inappropriate, taking into account the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"At the same time, of course, when we recruit people we need to have a good age structure, so young people will be recruited in the future."
"There will be some senior people but there will be no age limit in the notice of competition."
"I too wish to thank the Commissioner for the very encouraging news he has given us this afternoon."
"However, we know that there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip and that a recommendation to the Commission does not necessarily mean that the Commission, as a collegiate body, will accept it."
"Firstly, I should like to ask him what he judges his chances are of getting it through the Commission and, secondly, what happens after that?"
"Does it mean that there has to be a revision of all the Staff Regulations, which are common between all the institutions?"
"If I expected my chances to be very limited I would not have announced my intention here."
"As far as the legal side is concerned, our Staff Regulations do not oblige us to use age limits, so no changes are necessary there."
"However, when we publicize new posts they must go through the normal procedures with the joint committees."
"For that reason, last week we had political consultations with the staff organizations on the matter."
"We have given them further information."
"I expect, if everything goes as planned, that in January we will try to take a first decision, which means that we will abolish age limits and right after that publish the new general competition for officials, so that we do not remain on the level of general decisions but pass directly to the next European competition for officials without age limits, which would be organized in 1998."
"Parliament has put a great deal of effort recently into including the outlawing of discrimination on the basis of age into the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This was successful."
"I am pleased, therefore, that the Netherlands has been the first country to implement this."
"I am also pleased, of course, with the Commission's decision to no longer set any age limits in its job advertisements."
"But I would like to take you up on how you will police this."
"Would the Commission be prepared to issue a yearly overview to Parliament on the actual appointment policy, so that we can see what the ages are of the people who haven been appointed?"
"Secondly, you said, you will be able to get things changed in Parliament yourselves."
"I can tell you that we have talked with the President and the Secretary-General on numerous occasions, but Parliament is very conservative on this issue."
"I think it must be to do with the average age of members of Parliament."
"Mr President, I am responsible for the recruitment of personnel in the Commission."
"My responsibilities include taking decisions on all manner of recruitment issues."
"After the decision has been made to end age limits, I'll be responsible for the matter and I'll attend to it."
"They will no longer exist."
"But if you want to see a list of those situations where age limits will be imposed, contrary to this decision, I will gladly prepare one, although it'll be very short."
"Actually, there won't be anything on it."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, it seems to me - and this really a point of order - that a question should be given a response."
"My question was by no means answered."
"I fully respect Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's opinion, but in order to comply with the Rules of Procedure I must now allow Mr Truscott to put a supplementary question."
"Mr Liikanen, when replying to Mr Truscott you are free to say whatever you wish."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"Would he join with me in calling on all EU institutions to abide by the spirit of the Amsterdam draft Treaty on anti-discrimination on ageism?"
"In the light of that, does he have any target date for the phasing out of age limits in all the EU institutions?"
"Mr President, I am sorry, I misunderstood the question."
"Of course we will be able, if need be, to provide information on a yearly basis on the ages of staff recruited in a general way."
"There is no problem in that."
"As for the Amsterdam Treaty, we are all bound by it in the same way, obviously, but we should I think refrain from commenting on the recruitment policies of other institutions."
"I am responsible for what the Commission does and you have the right to observe."
"What other institutions do is rather harder for me to take a view on from the legal point of view."
"Question No 33 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0895/97)"
"Subject: Implications for the Member States of the European Parliament's first reading of the 1998 budget"
"The European Parliament's first reading of the 1998 budget entails an increase of payment authorizations of ECU 1 700 million over the Council's first reading."
"For some Member States this increase implies perceptible costs for their national budgets in the form of higher membership contributions."
"For others it implies greater amounts flowing back in the form, for example, of structural fund support."
"Will the Commission describe the economic implications for the Member States of the European Parliament's first reading as compared to the Council's first reading?"
"Which countries will gain and which will lose as a result of the European Parliament's proposal?"
"Mr President, I thank Mr Sjöstedt for his important question."
"In the first debate on the 1998 budget in the European Parliament appropriation was increased by ECU 1.7 milliard."
"The sum is meant to cover the extra costs set aside for Member States and the Third World."
"The Member States, however, must also fund these additional costs."
"The Commission is requested to specify to the Member States the future net benefit of these increases."
"The Commission has often made it clear that it does not consider it possible to unambiguously gauge the merits of Union membership."
"The advantages surpass mere considerations of bookkeeping."
"For example, the effects of freeing up trade on economic growth and living standards are impossible to measure in each individual Member State."
"Just as hard to assess is the influence the internal markets will have on growth, or the economic significance for Member States of the strategy being undertaken for membership."
"Jacques Santer presented a document to the Ecofin Council on this issue on 13th October of this year."
"The document is now available on the Internet on the Europe home pages in the eleven official languages of the Community."
"I would like to state that the increases in expenditure proposed by the European Parliament and the way they are to be funded are subject to the same interpretation of the juste retour system as any other budget."
"This being the case, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to make detailed assessments."
"I thank the Commissioner for his friendly reply."
"I promise to read the document which the Commission's President, Mr Santer, has drawn up and which is on the Internet."
"I thought, however, that having such a good grasp of the budget (as I know you have, you know where the money comes from and where it goes), you could perhaps at least give a small pointer in the principal directions."
"Mr President, the increases proposed by Parliament will fall into place like the employment initiative in Europe or the Socrates programme."
"These are things that have a general importance for employment and youth exchange programmes throughout Europe."
"I wouldn't like to make judgements as to how a Member State might benefit one way or the other."
"I believe that everyone will gain."
"But, obviously, each Member State, just like parliament, has the right to make its own assessments."
"The Commissioner will know that in the Netherlands a lively discussion is taking place as to who are so-called net payers."
"My question to the Commissioner is: when can all relevant figures be issued, so that the discussion can at least be based on real figures?"
"Mr President, the document, which was submitted to at the Ecofin Council and is now available to everyone, contains our assessment of the extent to which resources for structural funding or agricultural funding have been divided up among the various countries."
"There again it assesses to what extent these break down into payments to the Commission in the form of VAT or GNP and to what extent they come from traditional national resources, mainly customs duties."
"The document is now available and people can make their own judgements accordingly."
"But I would stress that the issue is a complicated one, partly owing to all these problems on the outside."
"As we now, for example, prepare for enlargement, we will invest heavily in straightening out the economies of the central and eastern European countries."
"It will mean better security for Europe and, in the future, greater prosperity."
"European companies will be involved in many such projects, but it is extremely difficult to tell which countries will reap the greatest rewards, and which the smallest."
"But, as I said, the information relating to structural funding and agricultural funding is contained in the document I mentioned, which is at your disposal."
"I would like to say to the Commissioner that what I believe Mr Sjöstedt and also Mr Cornelissen are seeking is not a measure of these indirect effects, which are of course always the result of everything, but what people want is quite simply a solid statistical basis with regard to the precise financial payments inwards and outwards."
"Such a thing must in all likelihood exist."
"We have of course payments coming in which clearly come from various countries."
"It is also the case that each budget item obviously has a destination in a particular country."
"It must be possible to make this simple division, i.e. according to the direct financial destination, both with regard to the EU's total budget and, in this case, with regard to the increases which Parliament has proposed."
"I would also like to agree with Mr Cornelissen that it would be desirable if the big debate taking place all over our countries in the Union could be based on a very thorough statistical foundation."
"Mr, President, as I said, this information, which relates to agricultural and structural funding, are in the document distributed by the Commission, which is available to everyone."
"It accounts for more than 80 % of the budget."
"Then, in the matters of external relations and administration, things get pretty complicated."
"There will also be questions of interpretation relating to internal policy."
"But I will say again why this matter of expenditure is not so simple."
"For example, when we make guarantee funding payments in agriculture, often an exporting company might be, for instance, a company in Belgium which exports agricultural produce from France or Holland."
"That is why things do not always balance out."
"The other example is that we often require in our community programmes projects to involve companies or research institutes in at least three Member States."
"But the account we are paying in to is generally geared to one Member State."
"It is never possible to get fully accurate information on this, but we have strong indicators from a precise knowledge of how much everyone pays to the Community, what structural funds there are and what each Member State gets, and what is paid out of agricultural guarantee funds. Though some of it might move from one country to another."
"Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen."
"Mrs van Putten wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I would like to offer my apologies for having been held up, and arriving a little too late for the reply to my question."
"I would like to express my reget."
"Thank you, Mrs van Putten, but the Presidency has already received your apologies. We realize that Members have a great deal of work to do during the part-sessions."
"Furthermore, in your particular case, the Presidency is aware of the highly responsible way in which you work."
"The 1985 regulation sets out the Community rules for driving times and rest periods and article 4(2) of the regulation exempts passenger vehicles carrying nine or fewer persons including the driver from the requirements relating to driving times and rest periods which are checked by means of a tachograph. article 13(a) of that regulation permits national derogations which allow Member States to have passenger vehicles carrying up to 17 persons to be exempt from the requirements of the regulation."
"The United Kingdom has taken advantage of this national derogation in respect of minibuses."
"Within the EU United Kingdom rules are the exception."
"There is, however, no inconsistency within Community law since other Member States have decided not to use the derogation for minibuses."
"It means, however, that UK minibuses may only benefit from the exemption when they operate within the territory of the United Kingdom."
"Maintaining a high level of road safety and the enforcement of driving times and rest periods has particular importance in international passenger transport which normally involves relatively long-distance driving."
"The Commission, therefore, does not intend to propose any further exemptions from the requirements to fit minibuses with a tachograph."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his enlightening reply."
"I will certainly pass it on to a group of charity workers in my constituency who are trying to organize a trip to the European Union."
"My follow-up question is: Does Commissioner Kinnock think that this national derogation is unhelpful and, as a result, would he be making any recommendations on a personal level to UK manufacturers to instal tachographs as a matter of course in the UK?"
"That would deal with these difficulties."
"I apologize if I come in too quickly, Mr President. I am used to responding in the Westminster fashion, which is to respond instantly to a question."
"I understand the problem identified by the honourable Member."
"However, I have to say that the arrangements for the installation of tachographs and the observation of driving times and so on that follows from that appear to have caused no problems in other Member States."
"It is, of course, for the United Kingdom Government to decide whether they want to change from using the derogation to coming into full compliance with the law."
"If that was to occur, the impediments to travel from the United Kingdom to the rest of the European Union in minibuses would disappear."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock, but may I remind you that whereas in the House of Commons you use a single language, here we work in 11 different languages."
"Question No 35 by Tommy Waidelich (H-0774/97)"
"Subject: Commission document on road safety"
"A fresh approach to road safety is being discussed in Sweden, under which emphasis is placed amongst other things on the sharing of responsibility for road safety, between road users and those responsible for designing and operating the road transport system, and importance is also attached to the coordination of measures at local, national and European levels."
"In view of this, will the Commission state how many people have been killed or seriously injured in road accidents in Sweden and the rest of the EU in recent years, indicate the social cost of such deaths in Sweden and say whether it intends to take the necessary measures to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on Member States' roads?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question."
"Sweden has a relatively good record on road safety with a death and injury rate that happily is below the European Union average."
"Nevertheless, as the Swedish Government has repeatedly made clear, there is no cause for complacency when in 1994, for instance, the number of people killed in traffic accidents in Sweden was 560 and the number injured was 21, 083."
"The Swedish Minister, Mrs Uusmann, and her colleagues are to be commended for their latest efforts, to which the honourable Member has referred in his question."
"The Commission has calculated that the direct cost of road accidents, based on the cost of police, medical and emergency services and vehicle repairs, and the economic output lost as a result of deaths, is ECU 45 billion a year in the Community as a whole."
"When divided by the 45, 000 fatalities annually caused by road accidents, this produces an average cost of a million ECUs per death."
"In its communication last April on promoting road safety in the European Union, the Commission set out in detail its plans to build on the first action programme which ran from 1993 to 1996."
"The Commission's actions to try to strengthen road safety will focus on three main areas."
"Firstly, information gathering and dissemination in order to identify particular features of accidents and to assist with the development of policy priorities."
"Secondly, initiating and supporting measures that can help prevent accidents, with an emphasis on the human factor and its interface with the traffic environment."
"Thirdly, initiating and supporting measures to reduce the consequences of accidents when they occur."
"Whenever possible we will, of course, promote the transfer of good practice, working in conjunction with national and local authorities, police forces, manufacturers and driver organizations."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I think that the strategy which the Commission is now putting forward is very sensible in many ways."
"I also believe that it will help the transport cooperation which is currently taking place in the various Member States."
"Just as the Commissioner said, it is the case that even though the number of accidents in Sweden has gone down, there is still a great desire to improve road safety."
"Our vision is to achieve zero injuries and zero deaths in one year."
"I think above all that the profitability calculations which the Commission emphasizes are a very positive new way of working, to quite simply provide more encouragement for the work on profitability calculations in the question of traffic safety measures."
"Just as the Commissioner said, people then include the costs of accidents."
"In that way we can also justify efforts in a financial way."
"Lastly I would just like to put a follow-up question: Does the Commissioner believe that during the next year more concrete initiatives are going to be taken on the basis of this programme?"
"I am thinking, among other things, of the directive on vehicle safety etc."
"Thank you, Mr Waidelich."
"Mr Kinnock, you now have the floor - in the European Parliament, not the House of Commons."
"Mr President, they might have only one language in the House of Commons, there are however a variety of accidents which from time to time cause difficulty with understanding."
"That is apart from the political reasons for failures of understanding, of course."
"Could I say to Mr Waidelich that I am grateful for the comment that he made in his supplementary."
"There are further initiatives to be contemplated by the Commission, not least the pursuit of a proposal last made in the late 1980s on trying to secure a uniform lower level of tolerated blood alcohol content amongst drivers."
"I think it appropriate to particularly draw attention to this at this time of year."
"Road casualties are not only sometimes higher around Christmas and the New Year but have a particular tragedy attached to them."
"All efforts to reduce accidents on the roads are obviously worthwhile, not only because of the huge savings that accrue but most of all because every life saved is a tragedy avoided, not only for the family that is bereaved of a loved one, but also of course for the people responsible for causing deaths and injuries."
"I would just take this opportunity provided by the honourable Member's question to make a special appeal that right throughout the Union this year people will avoid drinking and driving and show particular care, especially in winter weather, to try to save lives and avoid tragedy."
"I am also interested in this question."
"I think that the reply from the Commissioner is good with regard to the general contributions which the EU and the Commission can make, such as providing and gathering information."
"It is perhaps going a bit too far to believe the Commission should produce a unified report on avoiding injury in the individual Member States."
"I have a supplementary question."
"This seems to be mostly about roads."
"It would be very interesting to know, based on what we are now discussing, which kinds of traffic are safer or less safe, especially which kinds are safer, so that we who are able to encourage traffic measures concentrate on the right kind of traffic."
"Is it possible to get a reasonably satisfactory answer to this question?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question."
"It permits me to point out that in the course of the work that I described in outline earlier, our efforts to examine the human factor in accidents and the interface with the environment include attention to the effect of different kinds of infrastructure on the potential for accidents."
"The traditional method of making measurements and assessments of this kind is found wanting simply because it does not take into account particular sets of circumstances."
"For instance, an improved road might contribute to the prevention of accidents."
"However, it can also induce increases in speed which increase the severity of accidents."
"We are trying in our work therefore to make distinctions within the general definitions that will assist local and national authorities in the design of infrastructure to enhance to the greatest possible extent the safety of road travel."
"I hope that the honourable Member, like others, will not only seek to exploit the information that we are able eventually to provide but to see that it is applied effectively at local level."
"Question No 36 by Florus Wijsenbeek (H-0785/97)"
"Subject: Rail shuttle between the Netherlands and Poland"
"Is the Commission aware that the rail goods shuttle between the Netherlands and Poland operated by Poltrein BV has had to close down because of a lack of cooperation and because of bureaucracy on the part of the Poles?"
"Is the Commission prepared to take steps to enable this contribution towards shifting transport from roads to the railways to continue?"
"The Commission is aware of the problems identified by the honourable Member in his question which have been experienced by Poltrein in developing or trying to develop an intermodal shuttle service between Almelo in the Netherlands and Pozna in Poland."
"It is, however, incorrect to state that the service has had to close down."
"It is, in fact, continuing on a twice-weekly basis."
"Some of the problems which Poltrein has experienced have been of a commercial nature. The operating company recently informed the Commission that it is in negotiations for a possible merger."
"One consequence of that merger would be a modification of the service to run from Rotterdam to ódż in Poland, which should help to make the service commercially viable."
"The operator has also informed the Commission of a number of operating problems due to customs procedures in Poland and difficulties with the Polish railways as well as with rail companies in the European Union."
"The Commission intends to raise these problems, where appropriate, in the relevant subcommittees of the European Community Poland-Europe Committee, with a view to resolving them and with a view also to trying to improve the viability of this type of service which could potentially be extremely valuable."
"I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to the fact - and this may be question of translation - that in my question it says in Dutch: ""would eventually have to stop' , in other words would eventually have to stop their operations ."
"It does not say that they have already been stopped."
"But, Commissioner, I am very grateful to you for your answer and that you want to raise the matter during the talks with Poland."
"But I would nonetheless like to point out, that while things continue the way they are, while the train stops for an extremely long time and very frequently, as result of long border procedures and constant closing of border posts, then rail transport in Eastern Europe, and beyond Poland in the CIS be disastrous."
"Quite the reverse, road operations will gain power, and the Commissioner will know that Polish and Hungarian road use is increasing extremely rapidly; so this is totally contrary to the Commissioner's wishes."
"Would he, in addition to raising the matter, like to make concrete proposals and, if necessary, give Polish Customs a helping hand to speed up the matter?"
"Mr President, I have no supplementary question."
"I enjoyed my one question in question time."
"However, since you are giving me the floor, I might be permitted a comment."
"I am far from criticizing the way you conduct your office."
"Only, when we have so many questions to the Commissioner -and I have been waiting for months now, Mr Kinnock, to put a question myself - then it is bad if you permit too many supplementaries, because it is entirely up to you how many you allow."
"This means, therefore, that I will not get another chance today and must wait another three months."
"No, Mr Schmid, that is not a matter for my own free will, but is stipulated by our Rules of Procedure."
"All I can do, Mr Schmid, is try to interpret the Rules of Procedure as flexibly as possible, but I must also make sure that we keep to time, otherwise other questions suffer."
"However, you can make your views known to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, to see if we need to modify Question Time. I am sure that committee will be very interested in your views."
"Mr Cornelissen has the floor, for a supplementary question."
"With reference to the Commissioner's good news that the rail freight freeway between Rotterdam and Italy will soon be commencing, am I to understand from his response that sufficient agreements have been made to prevent problems at the internal borders, and, Mr President, will he go as far as to make an estimate of the average speed of the freeway?"
"On the basis of information as recent as last week, I have every reason to suppose that the service with the first rail freight freeway will commence within weeks."
"I would not want to be more specific than that."
"I do not want to made a liar for the sake of a couple of days."
"But we are not far away from the commencement of the service."
"Since the time allocated to this set of questions has now expired, Questions Nos 37 to 42 will be dealt with in writing."
"This question concerns the closure of Chernobyl and more particularly about the completion of two nuclear power stations which have to serve as alternative energy capacity."
"In answer to the question, I would like to say that the Commission was asked by the relevant Ukrainian organizations to provide partial funding by means of a Euratom loan for the completion of these two reactors."
"In this context and in accordance with the relevant Euratom procedure the administration of the Commission has taken a number of measures with a view to forming a judgment of the various aspects of the project to enable the Commission in due course to take a responsible decision."
"The Commission can confirm that the EIB is at present preparing its recommendation with regards to the completion and the upgrading of the two reactors R4 and K2."
"The Commission also confirms that the American firm Stone & Webster is at present conducting an economic analysis of the project as part of the Ukrainian request for a supplementary loan for the R4/K2 project."
"The Commission, moreover, is presently financing EU consultants through the Tacis programme to help Ukrainian organizations gather the data which it has to submit according to Euratom and EBRD procedures for financiers."
"This obviously also applies to cost estimates, and as far as the accuracy of this estimate is concerned, the cost estimate for the two reactors must, as with all industrial projects, be adjusted constantly, in order to, amongst other things, include contingencies for the project."
"This factor should be taken into account when earlier estimates are referred to, such as the estimate used by international panel chaired by Professor Surrey."
"Risk analyses have confirmed that the most important risks for the R4/K2 project have been mapped and have reasonably been taken into account in the estimate, including contingencies."
"I would furthermore like to point out that a continuous exchange of views is taking place between financiers and the project management."
"This way the economic and financial analyses of Euratom and EBRD are always based on the most recent data."
"I am extremely surprised by the Commissioner's response and I can only characterize it as gobbledygook."
"The study commissioned by the EBRD under the memorandum of understanding by Professor Surrey is the only official study and I would like to ask the Commissioner if he has actually read it."
"I would recommend that he do so."
"It is quite clear that nuclear power can never be the least cost option and the least cost option must be adopted under the memorandum of understanding."
"Furthermore, can I have the Commission's confirmation that it will stick to the memorandum's criteria as to safety and that we will always ensure its safety is equal to that of the EU?"
"I do not want to hear another gobbledygook response."
"I really want the Commissioner to read the report."
"It is extremely serious because we could have another Chernobyl."
"I am just surprised as the respected representative, because the respected representative will know that when the Surrey report was published, it received serious criticism from the clients, and that a number of shortcomings were found, in particular with respect to the proposition that all thermal power stations are in operational condition, whilst most of the thermal power stations in the Ukraine are twenty years old."
"I would like to mention another point of criticism."
"No estimate had been included for the investments needed for thermal power stations, in particular with regard to the clean-up of the environment."
"Another point of criticism was that the investments in R4/K2 was not spread over the entire lifespan of these power stations, but merely over ten years."
"Finally, it contained no analysis of the macroeconomic consequences of the recommendation to import coal and gas."
"So as a result of the criticism it was decided to charge Stone & Webster to undertake a supplementary investigation."
"This expert consultancy, which has been asked by the United States to conduct a further investigation, is currently undertaking this, and during the first phase we asked Stone & Webster to continue calculating an economic computer model with different parameters, and this resulted in a report to the bank which was used by the working party of the Board of Directors of the EBRD in August and September 1997."
"This report concluded in terms of probability that one unit would probably reach the least cost phase very soon, namely in the year 2002, and that later this might also be the case for the second unit."
"The Board of Directors asked the bank to compute this analysis further and Stone & Webster is presently engaged in this."
"At the end of January a second report is expected, after which the Board of Directors of the EBRD will discuss it further in February 1998."
"Finally, I can inform the respected representative that the question of safety standards will obviously be examined closely, because that is what it is ultimately all about, and that when these two unfinished power stations are completed, it will be done in way which corresponds with safety requirements in the West."
"Question No 44 by Heidi Hautala (H-0861/97)"
"Subject: Proposed project for the completion of Khmelnitski 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors (k2/r4) in the Ukraine"
"The President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), in answer to a question of mine in the EMAC Committee on October 28th, stated that EIB employs the Least Cost planning principle in its economic advice to Euratom on nuclear loans, but their advice that Mochovce was not Least Cost was ignored."
"For the completion of k2/r4, the only valid official Least Cost Study under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) shows that the project is far from Least Cost, though efforts are being made to get around this."
"As Ukraine addresses its under-priced energy supplies, the proposed project will become even less Least Cost."
"Could Euratom afford to again ignore the opinion of the EIB, or will the Commission accept, for Euratom, the official view of EIB as final on the economics of the completion project, rather than granting a loan which would as a consequence not actually help the Ukraine?"
"This concerns questions about to the role of the European Investment Bank in all of this."
"The Investment Bank is requested to make recommendations concerning all Euratom loans, and these recommendations will be taken into account by the Commission in the decision process."
"I would like to point out, however, that the decisions on Euratom loans is not within the province of the Commission, and that it will be taken on the basis of a broad range of internal analyses and external studies from competent institutions."
"As far as the EIB recommendation with regard to Mochovce is concerned, I would like to remind you that the Commission did not take a decision, as the Slovak authorities decided to withdraw their loan application to the EBRD and Euratom before a definite decision was taken."
"The Slovak authorities consider it more desirable to complete the Mochovce reactors themselves, and this means that the European Commission is no longer involved in the project, and it therefore cannot give a guarantee that there will eventually be a level of safety which meets Western standards."
"As far as the K2/R4 project is concerned, the Commission is awaiting the recommendation by the EIB concerning financial and economic aspects."
"In due course the Commission will take its decision in complete accordance with the appropriate decision by the Council."
"As far as the economic aspects are concerned, the Commission is basing its evaluation on a series of external analyses, including the position of the EIB and the EBRD."
"Mr President, my question in a way referred to whether the economic recommendations made by the European investment banks have any importance when the Commission can make a resolution based on something quite separate from economic questions."
"The issue is obviously a serious one as the question arises as to what the Commission's officially undeclared and, as it were, subliminally expressed thinking will be behind decisions taken when it embarks on the Euratom projects."
"Would it possibly be that the Commission will be doing all it can to support new projects in the nuclear power industry in Eastern Europe?"
"There are many of us who would be against this."
"We cannot accept that the nuclear power industry be continually showered with new projects, when in fact it would be a lot more economical, rational and safer to lend support to, for example, natural gas."
"I am fully aware of the interest in this Parliament on the state of affairs concerning the closure of Chernobyl, because that is what we are ultimately discussing, and it is also why we are presently having a debate on what type of alternative energy capacity will be installed."
"During the past year I have regularly tried to inform the European Parliament about the situation, and about the further progress in regard to the decisions which were taken by the G7 at the time, to see to it as much as possible that the original promise by the Ukrainian government to close Chernobyl by 2000 would be realised."
"We are presently in a critical phase: at the time the G7 promised to examine and cooperate so that the two incomplete reactors would be completed in a responsible way, and on the basis of generally accepted safety conditions."
"With respect to Euratom loans, the first prerequisite of these is the economic survival chances of project concerned, whilst as far as the EBRD loans are concerned, the least cost elements also play a part, as well as a number of other conditions laid down in the EBRD statutes."
"To complete all this, Stone & Webster is presently conducting a supplementary study, about which I informed to the previous questioner. During the first few months of next year we therefore expect there to be more clarity on the position of the EBRD or on alternative funding possibilities, as it is in any case certain that, whatever the advice from the EIB with regard to the participation of Euratom, the Commission will never be able to go any further than funding 50 % of the project."
"So should the EBRD at some point not be able to provide its loan on the basis of the recommendations, alternative possibilities will have to sought."
"In the event that these are not found, then the categorical closure of Chernobyl in the year 2000 will be in danger."
"That is what is at stake."
"One thing to conclude, Mr President."
"It goes without saying, of course, that the Commission does not pursue a nuclear policy, in the sense of trying to obtain as many nuclear contracts for industries in the Member States."
"That absolutely cannot be the intention."
"We are trying to arrive at a sensible solution here, which is entirely related to our fear that the safety of power stations in Chernobyl which are still operational will not be sufficiently guaranteed."
"I would like to add once again: Chernobyl draws most attention because of the disaster at the time, but we have grave concerns about a number of different installations, also in the accession countries, where we need all the attention we can muster to try and improve their safety."
"We have now come to the end of the time allocated for questions to the Commission, so Questions Nos 45 to 90 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Beef and veal posing a potential health risk"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on beef and veal products posing a potential health risk"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity to inform Parliament about some developments in relation to aspects of Community veterinary policy."
"I would like to refer first to the question of what is known as SAM or specified risk material."
"As far as this problem is concerned, I would like to remind you that the Commission wanted to resolve this question a year ago, but was not supported by the Member States."
"I admit that this is a difficult decision, but in my opinion it is necessary and fully justified in terms of health policy."
"I later argued that a decision should be taken in July on the basis of scientific recommendations then available."
"But it was clear even then that this decision would have to be amended before it came into force as further scientific recommendations appeared."
"Unfortunately the Member States could not reach agreement on this either."
"Yesterday the Standing Veterinary Committee decided to postpone the date for introducing the Commission's proposal by three months."
"But no-one should assume that this 3-month postponement offers an opportunity to weaken the decision."
"We intend exactly the opposite."
"We not only need to refine some technical details of the decision, but must also take account of the completely new scientific discoveries which we have only just obtained, and which further reinforce us in our preventive strategy."
"Several Member States have already introduced national measures for specified risk material, and I emphasize that none of them intends to lower the high level of protection which they aim for in this way, quite the reverse."
"But it is all the more necessary to harmonize the measures at Community level."
"To come to a second area, you certainly know about the new scientific discoveries which have recently been announced in the United Kingdom."
"These have persuaded the British government to introduce some stricter measures."
"The recommendation by SEAC, the British scientific advisory committee, has resulted in new findings about the infectiousness of certain nervous tissue along the spinal column and of red bone marrow."
"These findings have been checked by the Commission's Standing Scientific Committee, and are mentioned in a statement which was published last week."
"I can assure you that we will take full account of this statement in reviewing the decision about specified risk material over the next few weeks."
"The United Kingdom had the option of either informing consumers and giving them the opportunity to decide for themselves, or stipulating that meat must be deboned before being marketed."
"The British government decided on the second option."
"The deboning regulation for beef which is sold in the United Kingdom will apply equally to beef from other Member States and third countries."
"This is neither - as was falsely stated - a full-scale embargo nor a violation of Community law."
"All other proposed measures by the United Kingdom regarding beef and beef products from other Member States and third countries are now being checked by the Commission departments for conformity to Community law."
"Another important aspect, which was mentioned in the statement by the Commission's Standing Scientific Committee and has resulted in all sorts of speculation in the media, is the danger from sheep meat."
"Let me emphasize that there is no link with any suspected danger from scrapie."
"We have been exposed to scrapie for centuries, and there is no reason to assume that it can now be passed on to humans."
"On the other hand, we know from tests that BSE can be passed on to sheep, and if they are infected it causes symptoms which are very similar to those of scrapie."
"The Scientific Committee therefore pointed out the risk that sheep might be infected with BSE if they come into contact with infected meat or bonemeal, and that this results in some risk."
"Last month I submitted a proposal for a decision to the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the acceptance of the negotiated draft agreement. This is the agreement with the USA, which in my opinion has a chance of succeeding in the Community."
"We managed to retain our level of protection in the area of public health, and to persuade the Americans, for the first time, to recognize the regionalization principle as the basis of Community animal health policy."
"Unfortunately, only a few days before the Council discussed the Commission's proposal for the first time, the USA published its proposal about recognizing the situation about animal health, and it is unacceptable to the European Union."
"The US Department of Agriculture has not recognized some Member States as free of epidemics like swine fever or Newcastle disease, although these diseases have not occurred in these Member States for a long time."
"We have invited the US authorities to come to the Community and check the situation for itself."
"Following this invitation, a team from the US Department of Agriculture came to Europe last week, to give itself a picture of the measures for combatting epidemics in the Member States."
"However, I would like to mention here another problem regarding the USA, which has occurred recently."
"The USA announced last Friday that it is temporarily suspending imports of ruminants and ruminant products from EU Member States and certain other European countries, because of concerns about BSE."
"It decided to impose this ban until satisfactory information is received about the control and monitoring of BSE in the relevant states."
"The USA obviously has a perfect right to take precautionary measures for health protection from BSE risks."
"However, the Commission is not of the opinion that this particular measure is justified, or that it is compatible with the USA's international obligations under the world trade agreement on health and phytosanitary measures."
"As basis for such measures, the SBS agreement recognizes the regulations of the appropriate international organizations, in this case the IEO."
"In its letter to the authorities of the Member States, the USA claimed that it is BSE-free according to IEO criteria, and would act within the IEO trade regulations."
"Neither of these claims is correct."
"The USA has only recently banned the feeding of scrapie-infected sheep to cattle, and furthermore has no animal carcass disposal plants operating to the standards required to destroy the BSE agent."
"Moreover, the IEO allows trade with countries in which BSE is present, but the USA has banned all imports from Europe, even from those states without a single case of BSE so far."
"I very much regret that the USA has taken this action, particularly so suddenly, without prior consultation and at a crucial point in our discussions about the conclusion of the veterinary agreement."
"As you can deduce from my explanations and the presence of my colleague Emma Bonino, the Commission is guided in these important health questions by a high level of consumer protection, both on the internal market and in trade with third countries."
"Mr President, Mr Fischler, like my colleagues I have been listening to you attentively, and you will not be surprised to hear that what you have said certainly does not make us all perfectly happy."
"But as I have often said elsewhere, being MEPs does not give us an automatic right to happiness."
"Allow me to make a few comments."
"In the last few days, I have again and again defended the view that the decision to postpone the implementation of the regulations on specified risk materials does not spell imminent disaster."
"Admittedly, I would have liked us to have at last had a safe, protected system by 1 January."
"Now let me consider four points which are important in this context and also create tension between the two scientific bodies with which we are concerned, namely the Scientific Steering Committee and the Standing Veterinary Committee."
"Before getting into detail, I want to ask you, Mr Fischler, and perhaps you too, Mrs Bonino, whether you believe competition between these bodies is now, at last, at an end, and that the Scientific Steering Committee and the Standing Veterinary Committee are both giving equal priority to health policy and preventive consumer protection?"
"Or do you believe, Mr Fischler, that it is still the case - and I know this is an assumption - that the Standing Veterinary Committee, at least, represents the individual interests of the Member States from which the representatives come, and not necessarily the position of the whole European Union?"
"Now let me say something about the individual points."
"The position is that the proposal on specified risk material has been postponed by three months, from 1 January to 1 April."
"We have three or four areas to consider."
"If we leave out the USA, there are three main areas."
"Do you think we will have succeeded in clarifying all these questions in the remaining time? I think even the scientists - who all happen to be men - will use the Christmas holiday period to celebrate Christmas."
"What will happen about cosmetics and pharmaceuticals?"
"Are you sure that we will succeed in regulating this area, both within the European Union and relations with the USA, and also in regulating what happens to pharmaceuticals which have already been produced?"
"How will you evaluate the new specification of specified risk materials, even in the Standing Veterinary Committee?"
"Will you include the spine?"
"Will you include the lungs, ganglia and so on?"
"How will you ensure geographic distinction, and will you encourage the Standing Veterinary Committee to cooperate with the Scientific Steering Committee?"
"One last point in my first speaking time - because luckily I have another speaking time at the end - the USA."
"Mr Fischler, it is ridiculous for the USA to say the control facilities in the Union would be insufficient."
"Are you prepared to go before the WTO arbitration tribunal and tell the USA that what they are doing with hormones and pesticides is a scandal?"
"If they think that they are clean as regards BSE, we want that shown before the WTO arbitration tribunal!"
"Are you prepared to do this for the European Union?"
"Mr President, I explicitly welcome the present decision, because it gives us the opportunity to make the necessary corrections and adjustments to earlier decisions."
"I say this, knowing that of course we are on a tightrope in this sensitive debate, to ensure that preventive consumer protection is an absolute priority in future, but equally to represent matters more realistically and more distinctly, particularly the risk materials decision and the different regional rates of incidence of BSE."
"Let me say quite clearly that it was a wrong scientific and political ideology from the start to define a part of a potentially infectious animal as doubtful in terms of health policy, so that the rest could still be sold."
"Furthermore, the new scientific discoveries are not so new."
"I would point out, in particular, that a number of scientists, the minority opinion, pointed out the problem of lymphatic and nervous tissues, but from 1990 onward they were repeatedly shot down."
"But at the same time, that means far too little was actually done in the past, precisely in the areas where BSE exists."
"Either an animal is healthy and suitable to be fed to humans or it is not."
"There is no in-between where BSE is concerned!"
"So I think it is right to take other criteria, such as geographical location, more into account here, as well as evaluation of the materials."
"In this connection, I would also like to say clearly that both the announcement by the USA and the announcement by Mr Cunningham must be explicitly rejected."
"With his announcement, Mr Cunningham is endangering the goodwill we have shown in the BSE monitoring committee about moving step by step towards abolition of the export ban under clearly stated conditions."
"The announcement breaks the law, so to speak, by going against a current decision by the Standing Veterinary Committee, and will eventually backfire against Britain's own interests."
"I also propose, Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino, that we take the opportunity to talk with you at the end of January or beginning of February in Parliament's standing committees."
"At the same time, our group will ask the chairman of the Scientific Steering Committee to report to the parliamentary committees, so that at the beginning of February, before the final decision, we can have a transparent and open debate involving Parliament."
"I also think the decision now made is not a gamble with preventive consumer protection, but gives us an opportunity to correct many things in the well-intentioned panic decision of 30 July of this year, and get things moving in the right direction."
"Mr President, it seems to me that the three months we are taking before implementing these regulations - that is, by 1 April 1998 - demonstrate that more cautious decisions are being taken without panic."
"For the time being we should take care not to thwart this attempt to reflect, to use this period of time to extend our knowledge from the viewpoint that health protection is of greater concern, knowledge which, we have to say, is not yet sufficiently reassuring."
"The simpler, more trivial, but even more agonizing question asked by the people remains unanswered: how can we still be infected by mad cow disease, by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?"
"No-one has yet managed to tell them."
"When we were in Great Britain, we talked to families of victims of the disease: they told us they ate a perfectly normal diet, the same as those of other members of the family, certainly not a dangerous diet, in the sense that they had not eaten brain or other so-called parts at risk, those we are now banning."
"These answers are therefore the first we have to find, and I think that, once again, we can find them in Great Britain."
"In my opinion, the English scientists, who quickly found an early answer on transmissibility from BSE to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, already know many of these answers."
"With regard to the Americans, Commission Fischler, I do not think they know a lot about the situation in Europe, but even if they do not say much, they make it clear that they are in favour of dialogue."
"So, frankness, clarity and decision first, but always towards a single solution: not to promote trade, but to protect public health."
"Mr President, this is obviously an initial reaction, and clearly we are going to have to come back to this in more detail."
"Firstly, I want to put on record deep concern about what the United States has done."
"That has to be resisted firmly, because it sends a very negative international signal that is not fair to the Union at large or to some of the Member States within it."
"I am afraid that it could have a cascade effect and certainly will damage consumer confidence within Europe, irrespective of its actual trade effect."
"Secondly, I am not entirely clear from listening to the Commission whether the incipient ban on trade into the United Kingdom has the goodwill of the Commissioner or not."
"I hope that further partitioning of the market will not be upheld by the Commission."
"It would be wrong, pending legislation being adopted in three months, to have additional internal bans. That should be resisted."
"Finally, I should like to ask whether it is the politics of the scientific community or the science of the political community that is holding up the SAM legislation, because every time we delay these things, again we raise doubts in the consumer's mind."
"Even if there is very low probability of risk, we damage both consumer confidence and producer confidence."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, Commissioner Bonino, you will remember our discussion in the monitoring committee, when the risk material measure was introduced, about regionalization, that is, restrictions to this measure, and Mr Fischler, you will also remember the constructive disagreement we had, because we argued that if we have no regionalization, that is, no restrictions, we also have no possibility of organizing an escape from BSE."
"You decided the opposite, and that is just where you fell into the trap."
"You did not think where the raw materials for pharmaceutical and cosmetic products come from."
"You had to decide on an exceptional regulation, and now Borchert, led by Germany and not wanting the risk material to be removed, blocks it, and lets you fall into the trap, and you have to postpone your measure by three months."
"In my opinion, the danger of infection by BSE was in the early years, but of course it must also be taken seriously that over three months worth of material which should really not be in the food chain will now continue to be consumed."
"If you had included a restriction, you would also have had no disagreement with the USA."
"I obviously think it is a scandal that under Borchert's leadership the opportunity to recognize New Zealand and Australia as BSE-free was blocked, although that would be possible if Germany is not recognized."
"Here the Council is blocking at the cost of consumer protection."
"But, Mr Fischler, Mrs Bonino, if you had followed our suggestion of including a restriction and not staking everything just on the internal market, we would not have the present situation."
"I hope it can be retrieved."
"I repeat, we have not reached the end of BSE."
"Regionalization also involves risks, but we must do it, to get protection going in an organized way and provide a low-risk escape route from BSE - because it is impossible to avoid all risk."
"For our part, Mr Fischler, Mrs Bonino, we will continue to make constructive proposals and cooperate in this matter for the benefit of everyone, I hope, including consumers."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying how much I appreciate the Commission's presence here in strength tonight."
"This reflects its concern, which we all share in this House, about the depth of the crisis and the way in which it is expanding - it seems to be in a lot of directions at once."
"This must give us all grave cause for concern, because I worry that the whole issue is getting out of hand as well as, arguably, out of proportion."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Fischler for his frankness and openness in explaining to us each step which has been taken and in sharing with us the various decisions taken by the Scientific and Veterinary Committee."
"I look forward also to hearing from Commissioner Bonino in due course her perspective on these matters."
"It is equally positive that it is now quite clearly a majority view that this is a European problem and that we have to have harmonization on a European level."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf was correct that regionalization, which I have been stressing as a possible way out for some time, is now being taken very seriously."
"Perhaps if anything positive can come out of the United States' position, it is that we are now looking seriously at that as an option."
"Certainly I deplore what the US has done."
"It seems to me to be typical of the high-handed way in which it behaves when its trade interests are at stake."
"At other times it invokes the WTO to prevent deals which the EU believes in, such as the trade in bananas, to give one example."
"What is to be done?"
"This is what the farmers are asking."
"The farmers in Scotland are saying: tell us what we have to do and we will do it; we will take all the eradication measures necessary, we will produce certification."
"We need to have a clear indication from the British Government and from the Commission."
"There is a clear anxiety and determination to find a solution - not to hide behind smoke-screens but to find a solution."
"I was intrigued by Commissioner Fischler's statement that the British Government had various options."
"It could have declared risks."
"For example, it could have compared the risk of eating lamb chops or other meat on the bone with smoking cigarettes, or drinking alcohol."
"This is an option."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner feels that would have been more helpful than what seems to be a total ban on all kinds of bone-in meat."
"I wonder where the Commissioner thinks we are going in the near future."
"The anger on both sides of the North Channel with the Irish, Scottish and Welsh farmers all at each other's throats has been caused by the frustration of not knowing how to go on from where we are."
"One last point: could the Commissioner confirm that the failure to address the problem of the exchange rate and the compensation of the British pound has been an exacerbating factor, which is clearly within the competence of the Member States to resolve?"
"Mr President, first of all I am saddened that we do not have a resolution before us tonight and that we do not have a vote on this particular subject."
"That should be put on record."
"Since March 1997, beef farmers in my constituency in Northern Ireland have watched their business being destroyed by the effects of BSE."
"They have waited in vain for a positive position to come forward from Europe and, indeed, from two United Kingdom Governments."
"All we have experienced is two steps forward and three steps backwards on every occasion."
"Their patience has been pushed to the limit and the miracle is that it did not boil over before."
"While no-one wants to see public demonstration, I have to say I understand the anxiety and share their concern."
"There has been a trailing of feet by the Commission and the Council."
"We need and require a sharper decisionmaking process, one that can end the duplicity."
"Farmers in the United Kingdom suffer not only from the BSE problems but also from the strength of the pound sterling."
"No decision has been taken to date by the United Kingdom Government to compensate for the green pound differential."
"That is, of course, an internal UK problem but it is aggravated by the advantage that exists for other Member States to export into our market."
"This is the point UK farmers rebel against."
"One can understand this and could be forgiven for believing that the advantage other Member States have at present encourages them to maintain the status quo."
"The unfair competition must end."
"Quite frankly, if Mr Cunningham takes the decision to ensure that unfair beef from other Member States will not enter the United Kingdom after 1 January, then he will have my total support."
"I would like to put two questions to the two Commissioners who I am pleased to see here and who are at the coalface of this problem."
"The first one is: on the beef certified herd scheme, are you now going to accept the decisions that have come forward and have been accepted by the United Kingdom Government?"
"Will you in January, at the next Council meeting, agree that the beef certified herd scheme is acceptable, is positive and can be adopted by Europe as a scheme that is safe?"
"Will you also move decisively - not drag your feet - on the bornafter date scheme?"
"Unless we get positive answers on those two points then the farmers in the United Kingdom will continue to demonstrate and they will do it, quite frankly, with my support."
"Mr President, we return to this issue in a very specific context, a context of the risk of a fall in guaranteed prices of around 20 % to 30 %, at a time when we have not recovered from the consequences of the BSE crisis."
"We discovered that a dead cow was used for meal in Belgium."
"We discovered later that even in Luxembourg a cow was infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and its carcass was also turned into meal."
"We have come to the conclusion that controls are apparently ineffective."
"We held a committee of inquiry. Its chairman is here."
"We have a committee monitoring the results of the inquiry."
"Its rapporteur is also here."
"The United States, which is going to send us hormone meat, can enjoy the luxury of rejecting our meat, on the pretext that it is hazardous."
"New scientific data has told us that meat has become hazardous."
"Our British friends, who had no hesitation in contaminating everything they could, are now lording it over us saying they do not want to be contaminated by us now! The pharmaceutical pressure group is continuing to back gelatin in medication capsules and so forth."
"Even Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has concerns, although he had no scruples before, and acted to prevent a motion of censure and was not worried about environmental problems, despite being a member of the Green Group."
"I think we were wrong to walk away from the political shock waves that would have been provoked by putting the burden of responsibility fairly and squarely on the Commission's shoulders."
"The abscess would have been drained immediately."
"Instead all this is going to go on indefinitely."
"Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler what exactly he is doing here."
"Is he wanting us to sympathize with him in the plight that is caused by this postponement?"
"Is he wanting to share with us the difficulties that come from the confusion we still have about tallow derivatives and about pharmaceuticals which seem, within the committees, to be inducing some sort of paralysis?"
"Or is he wanting to say to us that he understands that other people, including in the United Kingdom, are now having to take unilateral action because of a series of decisions that have not been made despite what we understood, at the Agriculture Council last July and subsequently, was to be a particular course of action?"
"I think the United Kingdom is right to do what it has done."
"The Commissioner acknowledged - he is shaking his head now, but I think he acknowledged - that the UK is not in violation of any treaty or legal obligations in terms of requiring imported meat coming into the country from 1 January - which is when the new provision should have come into effect - to be accompanied by certification that specific risk materials have been removed and also to require that that meat, when sold in the shops, is sold off the bone, as is now the case for United Kingdom products."
"The problem is - and I put it to Commissioner Bonino, who is going to reply to this debate - that it sometimes seems to observers, who have the safety of the consumer first and foremost in their minds, that we are not really making the rules properly in this discussion."
"Yes, there must be new precautions and to some extent new safety measures."
"But when safety measures are in place and appear to be working, they should also be acknowledged."
"That is a grievance in the United Kingdom; that the rules seem constantly to be changing."
"The other thing I would say in conclusion is that we have another question which I particularly put to Mrs Bonino, and that concerns the confusion that is coming out of the scientific advisory committees now in terms of what they are actually recommending."
"Curious things went round the world about sheep meat, about lamb."
"It took us quite some time to find out what was actually being said by the learned individuals concerned."
"We do not have a definitive statement yet about what exactly is intended by this committee."
"That cannot be right."
"It seems to me, therefore, that we now have the three worst possible ingredients as we face the new year."
"I say this with some sadness because I acknowledge what everyone here, including the two Commissioners, has done."
"We have nervous consumers who are often nervous for no reason."
"We have a farming industry which is in ruins, and we have Member States that are at odds once more because they are scrabbling around with directives and instructions that they cannot properly understand, precisely because of the lack of harmonization that Commissioner Fischler referred to at the outset."
"That cannot be right, it cannot be good."
"We have got to do better in the new year."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"I am seriously concerned, as many others are, with the ever-deteriorating state of the beef market and the confusion being created with regard to the vital matter of public health."
"We have in the European Union a common market in beef and in other products."
"This market has worked extremely well and when serious animal health problems arise, such as foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever or Newcastle disease, the geographical area involved is isolated and suspended from the common trade arrangements until that disease is controlled and eradicated."
"This system has served Europe well and can, if correctly used, eradicate BSE completely from the British herd."
"This is our objective."
"Very steady progress is now, perhaps belatedly, being made."
"The disease figures show this very clearly."
"There is no doubt that the British Government made very serious mistakes in its handling of the BSE crisis, but after much delay it has now put in place a well funded and scientifically based eradication programme which is working well."
"But the support of other Member States is being put at risk by the ban imposed by the government yesterday or the day before on imports of bone-in beef and lamb, and also the failure by the authorities in Britain to keep the ports open, as is required by the operation of the single market."
"The disastrous tit-for-tat mishandling is destroying all our efforts to rebuild consumer trust and confidence through the complete eradication of the disease."
"It has also given huge advantage to our trading partners at the expense of our own producers, also without scientific base."
"On behalf of the thousands of beef producers I want to appeal to the Commission and the British Government to act together to pay more attention to the real scientists and less to the biased commentators who are continuously getting it wrong."
"Mr President, I would like to begin my brief contribution by again thanking Commissioner Fischler for his openness and frankness from the very moment that this very serious matter arose."
"But I have to say that the continuing campaign in Great Britain against the import of Irish beef is and must be a matter of concern for all committed Members of the European Union."
"It is my view that the European Commission cannot stand idly by on this matter."
"It must protect the interests of all Member States."
"One Member State cannot be allowed to write the rules as it goes along."
"One country cannot be allowed to disrupt the single market."
"I am particularly angry at the attacks being made on Irish beef."
"There is growing evidence that British supermarkets and depots are being warned not to purchase Irish beef."
"Irish beef is known throughout Europe as a quality product."
"I challenge the British authorities to let the consumers make up their own minds and ensure that Irish beef is sold in British supermarkets."
"Every country has a right to promote its produce, but not at the expense of others'."
"What Britain is seeking to do at present is effectively to rig the market in its own favour."
"The single market is based on the premise of a fair marketing environment."
"Clearly, at this moment in time, Britain will not accept this basic ground rule."
"Hopefully, in the days ahead, we can redouble our political and diplomatic efforts in order to ensure the restoration of a balanced and fair competitive situation."
"Clearly the British Government is using Ireland as a scapegoat for its failure to address the genuine problems of its own farmers."
"Mr President, I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler how he can justify the decision to postpone the enforcement of the ban on specified risk materials and whether it is not indeed appropriate that it has been postponed until April Fools' Day."
"If the problem is damage to our beef markets and to consumer confidence, is the solution not to take the toughest measures to restore that consumer confidence?"
"We know there is much less BSE on the continent than in the United Kingdom, but we also know there is some."
"The toughest measures must be taken on the continent, as they have been in the UK."
"I suspect the Commissioner agrees, otherwise he would not have given tacit approval tonight to Mr Cunningham's actions."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Bonino: is the United States not dealing with Europe now as it dealt with the UK in 1989?"
"It may be that the way they have done it was inelegant, but is their intention not honest?"
"They say they want to protect the safety and integrity of their food supplies."
"Why is it that we have to attack the United States when what they appear to be doing is retaining consumer confidence in food there, in the way that we should be here in Europe?"
"Mr President, the two Commissioners will know that while there is a crisis in the agriculture industry in Wales, Scotland and England, there is catastrophe in the north of Ireland."
"They will also know that the three MEPs in this House representing Northern Ireland met the Prime Minister last Wednesday and he told us that he was going to negotiate a package with European help."
"Can the Commissioner tell us tonight whether the British Government put forward proposals for such a package and whether that package will be forthcoming?"
"I might say that I associate myself entirely with the remarks made by my colleague, Mr Nicholson, and no doubt if Mr Hume were here he would be saying the same thing."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his position with the proposals, of course, as always to protect consumer health."
"All farmers put consumer health first but the British farmer is fed up with being kicked around like a political football."
"We have reached a stage where something has to be done."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner the following points. Firstly, has the British farmer been discriminated against by the present British Government, as I believe it has, with its suggestion that it has to take British beef off the bone?"
"For those of us who like beef on the bone, what is the justification?"
"Has it just responded immediately to a SEAC suggestion?"
"As Mr Cox said, it is destroying consumer confidence."
"We have heard all along about the problems of the beef industry from our Irish and other colleagues and the pressures on the industry at the moment."
"Has the British Government applied for funding to help the revaluation of the pound?"
"If so, or if not, when does that opportunity disappear?"
"Is it within the next month?"
"I have two questions for the Commissioner to which I would like, if possible, an answer: if the UK unilaterally bans beef coming into the United Kingdom from which the risk material has not been removed, can the Commissioner invoke article 169 and take it before the Court of Justice?"
"I have one final question as the Commissioner for the environment is here."
"I heard the other day of yet another attack on the British farmer, namely that the Government is about impose a tax on fertilizer - that is just as an aside."
"Is that true?"
"Mr President, Mrs Bonino looked quite frightened that she had just become responsible for environmental policy."
"Let me make a few short remarks on the debate."
"Can we please be clear about one thing: British farmers are certainly very much affected, but they are affected because a government did nothing for ten years."
"The situation cannot improve dramatically because something has changed in the last year."
"Let me say something about a possible lifting of the export ban for parts of Great Britain."
"Mr Fischler will certainly do the same."
"Yes, Great Britain has made proposals since May."
"But presumably we all expect a scientific committee to take a view on this subject."
"That is surely our understanding of safety, consumer confidence and health protection."
"The Scientific Steering Committee quite clearly made additional demands."
"If we want to work seriously here and not just worry about how we look from the outside, not just make the quick press report - I say that as selfcriticism - we should read the extensive reports, which are also available on the Internet very carefully, then we would know what this steering committee says about sheep, cattle, and other animals."
"It is not easy to read, but we can read it, and then we know."
"There are still needs now."
"The steering committee says there is still no functioning certified herd scheme, not even in Northern Ireland."
"I will be the first to support it when there is one."
"I agree with those who say a postponement of this proposal is a good thing, if it will then be watertight."
"Because we want it to be watertight."
"If the USA believes it is BSE-free because it says it is, we must recognize that BSE-free is very clearly defined by the IEO, the International Epidemic Organization in Paris."
"According to it, the USA is not BSEfree, to put it equally clearly."
"And if the USA then thinks that it can ban certain imports and not others, that is wrong."
"I expect the Commission to take action against it."
"Also, Mr Fischler made a very clear distinction."
"He said that meat can enter Great Britain on the bone and must be deboned there."
"That is not an import ban."
"Not to allow meat in at all is an import ban, and I definitely would not support that unless there were good reasons!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I only want to speak on a few points which have been made here."
"My colleague, Mrs Bonino, will deal comprehensively with the various points of view."
"First, so that there are no misunderstandings here, the Commission first went to the Standing Veterinary Committee, which has decision-making authority, with the application to introduce certain modifications of the July decision."
"However, after hardly one Member State supported the Commission's proposal, we then decided to apply for a postponement, above all to ensure that various medicines, which in some cases are necessary to life, continue to be available on 1 January, and this was agreed."
"I would also like to make it clear that the Standing Veterinary Committee and the Scientific Committee have nothing in common except the word 'committee' ."
"It is quite clear that the representatives on the Standing Veterinary Committee represent the opinions of the Member States and nothing else!"
"But what we also received at the same time - and we must add, to be fair - is a new list of risk materials, this time from the Scientific Committee."
"This list is considerably broader and longer than the list which we had in July."
"We must quite simply acknowledge, and I would like to emphasize it in this context, that things can still continue to develop on the BSE problem, even scientifically, because new discoveries are always becoming available."
"And we want to take account of the new discoveries as they become available."
"In fact that has been our approach."
"So what matters now is to put together the various risks the scientists have flagged up, depending on the type of risk material involved, combined with the variety of risks according to the geographical origin of the animals, and to derive an appropriate final or further evaluation."
"We need a certain minimum time for this."
"We have therefore not made it easy for ourselves, but we have said that we shall prepare, comprehensively and quickly, an appropriate proposal, which will be prepared sufficiently promptly to enable us to come to a new decision within these three months."
"Mrs Bonino will certainly explain the content to you in more detail, if that is what you want."
"But we also need an overall risk assessment to proceed sensibly."
"Regarding the question of the so-called certified herd schemes, which has been mentioned several times, the situation has since developed as follows. Mrs Roth-Behrendt described the start very precisely."
"We received a working document from the British government, and it was assessed by the Scientific Committee and judged to be insufficient."
"But what was missing was clearly stated."
"This morning, we received from the British government the last, crucial element of the missing items, which is that it is prepared to set up completely separate slaughterhouses, and is 100 % prepared to take account of the demands of the Scientific Committee."
"We are therefore in a new situation, and must now do an appropriate assessment, discuss it in the Commission and make a decision."
"Regarding Irish meat, I would like to state very clearly that the Commission has protested strongly about the interference which has taken place in various British ports."
"However, I can report to you that the Irish Minister of Agriculture himself said today at the Agriculture Council that he is quite satisfied with the actions which the British government has meanwhile taken."
"One thing is true of both Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is that we recognize completely the difficult market situation which has occurred on the island of Ireland."
"We therefore made a decision last Friday to take meat into intervention again, exceptionally, for these two regions, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, at 50 % of the quantities which were applied for."
"This is the highest percentage that we have ever accepted in the last few months."
"We are therefore trying to take full account of those difficulties."
"Regarding the question of the SAM ban, or the United Kingdom measures, I have already pointed out that the measures taken in relation to deboning do not contravene Community law."
"But we are in the process of checking the other measures in detail, and identifying any treaty violations."
"Of course we shall proceed in parallel, as we must also proceed in relation to other states."
"Finally, regarding the USA, I would like to say quite clearly that our scientific committees, applying the IEO criteria, have not granted the USA BSE-free status."
"We are therefore amazed that they are proceeding unilaterally against European states and, so to speak, using two different yardsticks."
"I would also like to emphasize that of course we have protested appropriately against it."
"I myself will be meeting the American minister responsible early next year, and I hope to clear these new difficulties out of the way."
"If not, of course we must investigate whether we can bring the USA before the WTO on this issue."
"These are probably the most important questions involving my responsibility."
"Thank you!"
"Mr President, I do not have much to add because Mr Fischler's introduction and reply were extremely exhaustive."
"However, I would like to make three comments."
"First, this debate shows how difficult the practice of transparency is. In effect, we have just been describing problems to you in precise detail, and explaining that science evolves and changes, and that of course we need time to draw the consequences."
"And suddenly you do not like that."
"So we have to find some form of agreement."
"If you want transparency, that implies that you are sometimes told, ladies and gentlemen, that the situation has changed because the Scientific Committee has changed its position, and we are here to tell you about it."
"But if you do not want us here, we will not come any more."
"Secondly, the proposal on specified risk material was presented to the Council in December 1996."
"The Council rejected the proposal."
"Another scientific opinion followed."
"Finally, the proposal of 30 July was approved."
"Suddenly, there was a realisation that there was also a problem relating to pharmaceutical products, finished products and tallow derivatives for cosmetics."
"An amendment was proposed to the Council, which rejected it."
"It was supported by five countries."
"There was no other possibility except deferral for three months in order to harmonize modifications so far as possible, and to take a decision relating to finished products, taking account of new scientific advice."
"That is why the reply cannot be either yes or no."
"The situation is not all white or all black, and the Commission cannot put pressure on science, I am sure you understand."
"Thirdly, there is the problem of geographic origin, which everyone is talking about and in relation to which, unfortunately, the Scientific Committee has not drawn up any precise criteria."
"It is saying a classification on the geographical origin of tissue and product will be developed as soon as possible, and so on."
"So the Commission has returned to the Scientific Committee and pressed it to provide criteria, after which the Commission will see whether these criteria can be applied in a single market."
"That is the situation."
"But if you think every time we come here we are going to give you a reply which will be black and white at the same time, I am very sorry, because in that case there is no point in transparency."
"It is easy enough to make statements, ladies and gentlemen, but sometimes we need to work together as well and remember that we are analysing and applying a principle of precaution."
"Several factors therefore need to be taken into consideration, including costbenefit among other things."
"Mr Martinez, if firing a Commission could have resolved the BSE problem it would have been very easy, you know, because a new Commission could simply have been brought in to replace the old one."
"But where disease is concerned, things are a little bit more complicated."
"As for political shockwaves, these occurred, but my impression is that this was not nearly so much in the Commission as in public opinion."
"I have one final response, and a frank one, to make to Mr Nicholson."
"We are not dragging our feet, nor are we wasting time."
"The Commission's services have worked for the last eight months under a pressure which is frankly difficult to bear, I can assure you."
"And the response of the British government to the problems we put to it only came this morning."
"We were well aware that it is a learning process, and that we still have a lot more to discover, but for that we need time and it has put our work under well-nigh intolerable pressure."
"I understand the frustration of the producers, indeed I share their concerns, but frankly I was not the person who invented BSE!"
"We are working with all the energy we can muster and at full capacity in terms of time and thought processes to resolve these problems."
"But Members of Parliament will understand that sometimes we need to work together and not limit ourselves to statements for external consumption, which tend towards the populist and, I am sorry to say, do not help us make very much progress."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, I would just like the commissioners to wait to hear the point of order."
"No, if it is addressed to the commissioners it is not a point of order."
"You can only make points of order to the Chair."
"Mr President, a question was asked which is of vital importance throughout the European Union, and got no answer."
"I am sorry but we are over time."
"I understand the importance of this matter but we could take all night dealing with it."
"Energy policy (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0308/97) by Mr Scapagnini, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Commission communication 'An overall view of energy policy and actions' (COM(97)0167 -C4-0205/97)"
"Mr President, I want to try to get the interrupted debate on the Scapagnini report going again."
"Energy policy requires a global attitude and global political action."
"Even the title of the Commission's statement suggests that."
"The climate summit in Kyoto made the need for this global attitude clear, at least as far as the effect of energy policy on climate is concerned."
"But it also revealed how far apart understanding and implementation are."
"There is hardly a policy area where the gulf between what should be and what is, between a normative requirement on the one hand and actual policies on the other, is as wide as in energy and climate policy."
"The Commission's statement needs to be evaluated against this background."
"It presents us with the known arguments for the need for a global attitude and strategy in the energy field."
"There is the continually increasing dependence of the European Union on energy imports, and the resulting future risks."
"There is the rapid growth of world energy consumption and the associated shortage of supply, and not least there is the considerable increase in worldwide environmental problems and their long term effect."
"All this suggests that the European Union should have increased authority in energy policy, but we have not secured it, even in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"There is no clear, specific legal basis in the treaty."
"What is left, if you will excuse the comparison, is like the chatter of house-sparrows about the autumn migration to the south."
"The Commission's statement is an accurate but visionless compendium of all Community initiatives in the energy field."
"What remains to be done in this context?"
"What remains is to improve international cooperation on energy."
"What remains is to assess the energy and environment policies of the Member States regularly - that is new - and to try to coordinate them towards Community goals."
"We need synergy effects, not mutual blockades or zero-sum games."
"The implementation of the internal energy market guidelines for liberalization and integration of energy markets must be driven forward."
"What remains is to continue to work on the Community energy tax, which has failed up to now, and to encourage research, technological development and demonstration of renewable energy resources."
"I am anxious to know what is finally left of what we put into the fifth research programme."
"In short, what remains is to keep to the idea of an outline energy policy programme, and to strengthen energy policy actions through cooperation between the Member States."
"This requires periodic reports about national activities and their effects."
"The rapporteur, Mr Scapagnini, sees this stimulation of the Commission, and assesses it as suitable."
"What I would like to see in future - I only want to mention it briefly - would be specific implementation strategies..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Scapagnini on this report."
"It is a comprehensive report and calls for many of the things which the Liberal Group has supported."
"We are beginning to realize now how wise it would have been to write a chapter on energy into the Maastricht Treaty."
"Particularly in the light of the failure of the Kyoto Conference, the problems of our energy policy are becoming much more apparent."
"I regret one thing in this report, namely that the Commission appears to have given up on its campaign to introduce rational planning techniques into the electricity and gas sectors."
"These techniques would certainly show us the way forward."
"The Commission put them forward before and seems now to have withdrawn from that."
"The Commission has to look wider too."
"We have to look for five leitmotifs for energy policy in the European Union."
"First, we have to introduce a major programme of investment in energy conservation in Europe."
"Second, we have to encourage consumers and firms to use energy more efficiently."
"Third, we have to cut the costs of energy efficiency in homes and offices."
"Fourth, we have to make new buildings and machinery, vehicles and appliances more energy efficient, and work is being done on this."
"Finally, we have to increase support for renewable sources of energy."
"It is essential that these are done."
"The Commission is beginning to show the way forward, but if we are serious about it we are going to have to put the money behind our political intentions."
"Mr President, when we talk about the energy policy goals of the Community, I think of Fontane."
"It is a broad field, and I must add that it is in thick fog, because we have no uniform energy policy goals."
"I can make this clear to you with a few examples."
"We always say that we must definitely become less dependent on imports."
"Then the example of the nuclear industry is given, and everyone forgets that of course we must import the uranium for that."
"We always talk about energy efficiency, but we do exactly the opposite."
"I would just remind you of the Save programme."
"We always talk about renewable energy."
"I would just remind you of the Altener programme."
"It has been cut to ECU 22 million for two years, which is ridiculous when we have paid ECU 250 million per year for 15 years for fusion."
"We also talk about renewable energy creating many jobs, and being good for the environment, but nothing happens."
"What we need in the end is an energy tax."
"What we need in the end is renewable energy, energy efficiency."
"In the end we must use all possible means to continue to develop these."
"We cannot do that with the pittance left over because everything is going into fusion."
"We also urgently need codecision by the European Parliament, and furthermore we must have a separate energy chapter at last."
"We have none of that."
"So I can only conclude with the words of Brecht: the circumstances are not right, because the Council blocks everything, and as long as that continues we will have no energy policy goals, but go on sprinkling a little everywhere with the watering-can, and putting all our money into fusion, when all we know about it is that it may produce energy in the year 2080 or 2050 at the earliest."
"Mr President, I share the general disappointment at the failure of the Amsterdam Treaty to take on board the business it was supposed to discuss, which was the formation of an energy chapter."
"The European Union started with two energy Treaties: the European Coal and Steel Community and the Euratom Treaty."
"The European Coal and Steel Community has served energy well and the Euratom Treaty, although anachronistic and definitely a 1957 Treaty, has been a very powerful impetus to one form of energy - nuclear energy."
"If the EU has a competence, things happen."
"As far as Kyoto is concerned, there are only three things you can do in order to diminish CO2 emissions: one is to rely on nuclear energy - but there are very big risks and problems involved in that; secondly, you use energy more rationally and, thirdly, you turn to renewable energy sources."
"If we had an equivalent to the Euratom Treaty - I would call it the Eurenew Treaty, a treaty on renewable energy - we could do something."
"This would make things happen in Europe and give considerable added value to the European Union's work on energy."
"I have to say that I find the second part of conclusion 11 by Mr Scapagnini unacceptable, because it recommends additional help to nuclear power."
"This is not the answer."
"I am also very disappointed at the reported reaction of the Council of Ministers to this communication from the Commission."
"It is a very sensible communication."
"It makes it absolutely clear that if you seriously want to do what we said in Kyoto we would do, you cannot do it without a legal base or without giving yourself the competence that was given so effectively when the European Union started back in the 1950s."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Scapagnini in his absence, on a succinct report."
"It lays down some valuable guides for our consideration of the energy framework proposals which have just been approved by the Commission."
"We really have to move energy issues up the political agenda. We ought to have the same basis as for the environment."
"The legislation should be subject to qualified majority voting."
"The fact is that energy consumption is increasing."
"In 1996, the last year for which we have figures, it was up by 3 % in world terms and 3.6 % in the European Union."
"The starting point has got to be a strengthening of the analysis of energy demand."
"Unless you have the figures you cannot determine policy."
"We need to look in much more detail at consumption per capita, energy intensity, electricity intensity and the primary fuels that we are using for electricity production."
"I must tell you, Mr President - although in your case you will already know - that the liberalized market may make this even more difficult than it was before."
"We have to concentrate very strongly on the question of energy efficiency: the energy efficiency of production and of use."
"Unless we get those things right, all the other things that we talk about will just be straws in the wind."
"I want to draw attention to a factor which I drew attention to earlier in the debate on the research programme."
"It is small companies that have the greatest difficulty in making use of the resources that we have at Community level."
"I am talking about companies of less than 50 people."
"That is an area where we have to make a much greater effort."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Aid to shipbuilding"
"The next item is the report (A4-0377/97) by Mr Sindal, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation 3094/95 thereby further prolonging the relevant provisions of the Seventh Council Directive on aid to shipbuilding (COM(97)0469 -C4-0526/97-97/0248(CNS))"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Sindal, because he said clearly that prolongation is right, and I am not going to say much about that, but let us come to the point."
"We agree."
"As long as the USA does not ratify the OECD agreement about eliminating order-related shipbuilding subsidies, preventing its implementation, we must ensure that the shipyards in our Community have at least half a chance against the highly subsidized shipyards in Asia, as well as other shipyards around us."
"But we must take care that, if we decide on a common upper limit with the prolongation, the Member States make use of it, so that we do not have support in one Member State but not in another, because then we have a new distortion of competition within the Union."
"I also share Mr Sindal's ideas about the debate should the USA still fail to ratify the OECD agreement. I find the Commission's idea of submitting our own subsidy regime correct in principle, but we should check it very carefully."
"Yes, Mr Karel van Miert, we both know that; we must be careful, subsidies must always be for a limited period, and they must be degressive."
"Those are the first two principles."
"Let me also mention two more principles."
"We must take care that the so-called investment subsidies which are to be newly created are not mixed, linked or duplicated with the subsidies for research and development."
"Second, we must take care that the investment subsidies are not linked to the traditional support areas of regional aid."
"Then of course some shipyards would drop out although they are much more competitive than others."
"Their chances would be reduced."
"We must take this up with the shipbuilding sector."
"Third, we must take care that the support rates in the Union are as uniform as possible, to prevent further distortions within the Union."
"There will certainly be an exciting debate about this in the next year."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Sindal that there is a need to prolong the Seventh Directive."
"It is essential that we do not have a period without legislation in this field."
"But it is also vital for the US to ratify the OECD agreement."
"Like Mr Sindal, I would like to hear what the Commission is doing to put pressure on the American government, and whether the Commission can say how far the US has got with its own deliberations."
"On the other hand, I am very concerned at the Commission's proposal for the Council Directive on new rules on aid to the shipbuilding industry."
"It is quite simply unacceptable."
"The Union's aim must of course be to phase out aid to the shipbuilding industry."
"The Commission's proposal replaces relatively transparent operating aid with less transparent forms of aid which will favour some shipyards rather than others."
"The shipbuilding industry must prepare itself to survive without aid."
"We will of course come back to this proposal on a later occasion, but for the moment I can say that it is not my cup of tea."
"I can understand the Commission's argument that we must have clear rules and not end up in a vacuum if the US does not ratify."
"If the US does not ratify the OECD agreement, other countries may perhaps start adopting policies which distort competition."
"So you - and you in particular, Mr van Miert - must make every effort to put pressure on the US Congress to ratify the OECD agreement by the end of next year."
"Mr President, I approve the regulation which is proposed, and the report by our colleague, Mr Sindal, but I am concerned about the recent approach of the Commission."
"It is anticipating the application of the 1994 OECD agreement by proposing to ban state aid from 2001."
"The United States would not fail to interpret this as a signal from Brussels encouragement not to ratify the OECD agreement."
"The Commission has got us used to making unilateral concessions."
"This was the case for agriculture within the framework of the GATT agreements and for the aeronautical industry with the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger."
"Today, such ready acquiescence would be a new blow to European shipyards, which are suffering by serious difficulties."
"Employment has fallen from 280, 000 to less than 80, 000 in twenty years, and many yards have been closed."
"In the face of social dumping from certain third countries, we have to maintain existing assistance in a system which promotes the acquisition of ships built in European shipyards."
"In the immediate future, should we not also renegotiate the OECD agreement, and consider it as null and void if the United States do not ratify it by the end of 1998?"
"Mr President, until the 1970s my country, Sweden, was one of the great shipyard nations of Europe."
"That is no longer so."
"There is virtually no building of new vessels at all in Sweden any more, only repair shipyards for large vessels."
"There are of course many different reasons for this."
"One of them, however, is that there has been such tough competition with state subsidies from other countries that Sweden has not been able to maintain a shipbuilding industry."
"That is also why the OECD agreement of 1994 raised such hopes in Sweden that fairer terms of global competition would make it possible to begin to compete again when new tonnage was to be built."
"That is also why it is regrettable that this agreement, which should be able to provide reasonably fair terms of competition, has not yet come into force."
"Obviously I support Mr Sindal's report, which is based on the idea that once the USA ratifies the agreement it will also be respected within the EU."
"Until then it is, however, quite reasonable to continue with a certain amount of state subsidy so that the industry is not wiped out."
"In my party we have also proposed that Sweden should again be able to give the shipbuilding industry a limited state subsidy in order to be on equal terms with other countries."
"I am therefore going to vote for the report."
"I would like to start by thanking Mr Sindal and the committee for the speed with which this report was produced, because we have to make a decision on the prolongation of this seventh directive by the end of the year."
"I had hoped there might have been no further need to debate this, and that might have been the case had the United States in the end ratified the OECD agreement."
"It is the only country not to have done so."
"There is nothing I can do about that, and I have to say to Mrs Riis-Jörgenson that a Commissioner can do a lot for competition, but one thing I cannot yet do is force the American Congress to ratify an agreement."
"I cannot do that, I have not got that far, I can have another think about how I might achieve it in future, but for the moment I am afraid I cannot give you any satisfaction on that front."
"For that matter I would like to say straight away, ladies and gentlemen, that we should distinguish between the issue today and what we will have to discuss in the near future, namely what will happen afterwards."
"This is a prolongation by a year until the end of next year, and if in 1998 the United States once more fails to ratify the OECD agreement, then we will have to have joint discussions about a new regulation."
"The Commission has made proposals for that."
"You may think what you like about them."
"But when the time comes I will be delighted to present them to you in committee and debate them in this House."
"But today I have already had a foretaste of that debate."
"Some think subsidies should be abolished as soon as possible."
"I also listened to Mr Querbes, who would like to continue them indefinitely."
"But I would remind you that during the years 1990-1995 ECU 5 billion in government support was spent on shipbuilding in the European Union."
"So those who claim that the European Union has not been pursuing a broad policy to try to enable our shipyards to adapt, do not know what they are talking about."
"By the way, I have to say to Mr Querbes that I also completely disagree with him about Boeing, but I cannot do anything about the fact that some people in France have got a completely wrong idea of the situation."
"Everyone here in this Parliament knows that much better than Mr Querbes."
"So I am obviously going to disregard what he said, because if someone is that far off the truth there is nothing to be done."
"I would like to conclude then by setting a rendezvous for the next debate, and I have already said that I am looking forward to that debate, because I believe the Commission has made a major effort in the proposals it has submitted in order to offer a solution which will mean that contractual government support, that is, operational support, can indeed be abolished in principle in the year 2000 at the latest."
"If there is a majority in the Council of Ministers to do this earlier, that will not be a problem for the Commission."
"On the other hand, we also want to offer our shipyards the opportunity in the future to carry out the necessary innovation, research and development, modernization of the existing yards, and, if necessary, to claim government assistance, because, in the future, when government support is no longer possible, we, the European Commission - and I am not speaking just for myself, but certainly for Mr Bangemann as well - wish to offer as many opportunities to shipyards as we can. We must ensure that we keep enough shipyards in Europe in the future for objective as well as for purely economic reasons."
"I would like to leave it at that, Mr President, but again, I already look forward to our next debate, which is bound to take place in a few months time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Services of general interest in Europe"
"The next item is the report (A4-0357/97) by Mrs Billingham, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission communication 'Services of general interest in Europe' (COM(96)0443 -C4-0507/96)"
"Mr President, it is almost a year since I began this report."
"In the search for consensus on this complex issue I have consulted widely throughout the Union and taken suggestions from all sides of this House."
"The report is a response to a Commission communication which quite rightly takes as part of its theme the concept that services of general interest lie at the very heart of the European model of society."
"My research confirms that."
"How the services are delivered is not at issue."
"It is the quality of the service that counts."
"Services are provided in a myriad of ways across Europe."
"They are delivered in monopoly and in competitive situations, by private companies, public bodies or by public-private partnerships."
"But it is the product and not the process that matters to consumers."
"My report focuses on economic public services which provide commercial goods or, more often, services for which there is payment."
"The notion of a people's Europe where social cohesion and economic growth are dependent upon the delivery of good services right across the Community underpins this report."
"Europe has been strong in trade and in industry with a bias towards business but weaker in its support for its citizens."
"Public services have a noble history and are valued by citizens, but standards vary."
"We must iron out some of these discrepancies and put in place a blueprint for systematic improvements in all specific areas of public services."
"The report recognizes the primary role of Member States in defining public services, with the European Union having a secondary role of fixing the minimal level of service, a universal service, examples of which have already been taken on board in postal services, broadcasting and telecommunications."
"I have identified three major areas where the EU can take a leading part."
"First of all we must have a clear definition of services which fall within the general interest area."
"Secondly, there should be a specification of basic universal services that should be expected by any citizen."
"Thirdly, there has to be regulation ensuring that the specified levels of service are delivered consistently across the whole territory of the EU."
"The EU should adopt a supervisory role to ensure that national regulators work to a consistent standard."
"The painful history of my own country - of badly managed privatization - is a warning to the rest of the Union from which we can learn a lesson."
"I have used the experiences in Member States, the Commission's communication, the Commission itself and many helpful opinions and advice received from colleagues, organizations, representatives and interested parties in arriving at my conclusion."
"My report before you today welcomes the new article 7(d) and calls for it to be implemented and calls for a number of other additional actions to be taken."
"Firstly I call for a charter of principles: principles for a service of economic interests to be drawn up by the Commission; secondly, I require and ask for democratic scrutiny for the Commission activity in that field to be developed in Parliament in the form of an observatory."
"The report also asks for Green and White Papers to be published by the Commission, laying out a timetable plan to translate treaty and charter aspirations into action and also seeks a special responsibility for public services to be attributed to one of the Commissioners and one of the Commission's Directorates General and for Parliamentary committees to have a specific brief within this area."
"This report has been an excellent example of all sides of Parliament coming together to produce what I hope is a sensible document."
"I thank colleagues for that."
"If we achieve a consensus here tomorrow at the vote, we will be making history."
"It will be the very first time that Parliament has achieved a common position on public services."
"I hope that we can do it."
"If we do, we will send a clear message to the Commission and the Council that Parliament is united in its determination to demonstrate that this is indeed a people's Europe, a Europe which works to make its citizens' lives better and a Europe which is set purposefully to achieve a fairer and more cohesive future for all its citizens."
"Mr President, this communication from the Commission on services of general interest gives an account of the future objectives with regard to the interest in opening up protected sectors or monopolies to competition, while at the same time we want the citizens to have access to services of general interest on the same terms and at reasonable prices, which is good."
"I think there is a central theme in the Commission's communication, which I also think Mrs Billingham arrived at in the end. It is that people must recognize the multiplicity of the scope of services and the various organizations in the various Member States, that there are big differences because of tradition, that there are different methods and that people should also recognize the principle of subsidiarity and that it is the Member States who in fact decide who should carry out the services, whether it should be private or public companies, and also whether special rights should be granted as long as people stay within competition law."
"It is good to have a debate in the form of a Green Paper, which is proposed."
"I believe, you see, that there needs to be a very broad debate in the Community about this."
"It must also be allowed to take its time. It is not something which can be implemented quickly."
"On the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we also believe that a consequential analysis should be done when services of general interest are deregulated in order to see the effects on social security, employment and, not least, on the environment as well as in peripheral areas."
"Experience from Sweden, Finland and the UK, where deregulation has been carried out in many areas, shows that there are both positive and negative effects and that people should also pay attention to the need for clear, socially justified rules."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, in its statement the Commission advocates an open economic model and marketing dynamics in the production of public utility services."
"The Committee on Regional Policy believes the principle is to be upheld as long as there is balance between competition on the market and the safeguarding of services."
"A totally free market, with no special arrangements, can, if things go wrong, endanger the provision of all the basic services we need, particularly in peripheral and sparsely-populated regions."
"On the other hand, legislation on public utility services cannot be allowed to preserve service monopolies."
"There is a need to improve general services, and their efficiency, in a continually changing operational environment."
"Just as important is the quality of services and their suitability for the individual and the community."
"That is why public services cannot be allowed to go the way of a heavily regulated pan-European system, but responsibility for their production and operations should be defined nationally, regionally and, frequently, locally as well."
"At Community level it is mainly the principles of security and fairness that are appropriate in this issue."
"The Community could also demand the creation of national principles, and, within them, principles to do with equality among citizens."
"One key principle of fairness is pricing, which regional differences can affect very greatly in a fully market-based system."
"In essential services, like, for example, the postal services, ""the same price for all' principle is still justifiable."
"The Committee on Regional Policy once again stresses that the liberalization of public utility services, making them competitive on the market, cannot endanger the provision of recognized basic services anywhere in the union."
"In peripheral regions subsidized and publicly provided services are often the only alternative, as, for example, with public transport."
"May I first of all congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Billingham."
"The report now before us is, as she said herself, more than a compromise; it is a foundation response to the Commission's statement, something we can build on. But as she quite rightly says herself: it is the quality that counts ; we are providing a product for consumers."
"This means that we have to see universal service for the public in general, and not, as some people think, that public services are there for the employees."
"They are there for the public."
"Now it is up to the Commission to draw up a number of definitions, because it is easy to refer in one's statement to the general interest."
"But the general interest is a broad notion which everyone interprets rightly or wrongly, but in any case differently."
"Let me give you two examples from the transport sector."
"First example: air traffic control."
"For years under national control, cooperating badly, leading to all kinds of obstacles in European air transport."
"This means that guidance must be given positively to arrive at a communal service."
"Let me give you another example, and unfortunately I cannot say of the Committee on Transport and Tourism's resolution what I was able to say of Mrs Billingham's, namely that the more it was rewritten the better it became."
"Mine seemed to deteriorate."
"If we look at the postal services - we already talked about this yesterday - I really cannot see what actually should be a universal service."
"Rail transport is a typical example of how a monopoly leads to obstruction in the internal market."
"The Commission should do something about this."
"We then agree with the exceptions to the rule of the best service for the consumer when it concerns peripheral regions and islands, but in any case, we have a long way to go, and a lot to deliberate about before we arrive at genuine service of general interest in Europe within the principles of article 7d of the old treaty."
"Mr President, like everyone else here tonight, I have to welcome Mrs Billingham's report."
"She has put a lot into it and has carefully considered all the issues, and it is an extremely balanced and reasonable report in response to the Commission's White Paper."
"In that context, with regard to the White Paper, I wish, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, to draw attention to the following."
"Whilst the Commission points out in the White Paper that consumers can benefit from the liberalization of public services, the very same process will mean that in some peripheral regions and where there is no possibility of profit in that service, the liberalization might result in services only being available at a price which excludes many consumers, or may simply mean that there will be no service at all."
"It is for that reason that the importance of accepting the need, at least in principle, for a universal level of service, must be recognized."
"Within the European Union the principle of universal service must be defined in the context of the Treaties, and in particular with regard to article 129."
"At the same time, the principle of public service must be protected by guarantees of consumer representation and guarantees about the affordability of those services."
"We must recognize the right of the public and of different Member States to provide public services in a flexible and variable way, ensuring that they can be provided by very many different actors or business activities, respecting above all, I think, the traditional methods that exist in different Member States."
"Diversity is something we must continue to respect."
"Public services have the possibility, if we continue to use them positively, to nurture new dynamic, environmentfriendly industries and build new sectors of the mixed economy, which will generate new jobs."
"It is for that reason that I suggest that we must enshrine a special place within the treaties for public services of common interest, ensure that they are protected from the most rigorous application of competition policy and ensure in future that citizens have a right, as a minimum, to a guaranteed level of public services in order to maintain solidarity throughout the Union."
"Mr President, services of general interest in Europe are necessary and important."
"It is important for those who are affected, who need a functioning infrastructure with important goods of daily life such as water, electricity, gas, and so on, even in remote regions outside the economic conurbations. These services are also important for a functioning transport infrastructure and a functioning infrastructure in the field of modern communication technologies."
"This applies not only to the traditional post, but also to radiotelephony, the Internet, etcetera."
"However, what is important for the Community, and in that sense for us all, is that all these services are offered within the economic framework which characterizes our Community as a whole, the framework of a competitive regime which is worthy of the name."
"It was certainly not easy to unite these two points of view."
"To talk of squaring the circle would probably be over the top, but Mrs Billingham should nevertheless be congratulated on finally putting together a text on which a broad consensus can be reached."
"For the Institutional Committee, of course, institutional questions were at the forefront of the considerations."
"In this respect we largely agree with the developments to the Billingham report in the various stages of its discussion."
"Much has changed here, and very much for the better."
"So again, heartfelt best wishes!"
"Admittedly we still have some reservations, for example concerning the legal nature of a special charter for such services."
"We still have serious reservations about the institutional structure which is mentioned in paragraph 12 of the report, although there have already been clear improvements compared to the predecessors of this report and the draft report."
"I would like us to reach a good joint conclusion even without paragraph 12."
"If we are successful, it will have been a joint achievement of which many in this Chamber can rightly be proud, and which we can hope will finally provide something for the citizens of this Community."
"I hope that then we will really have services of general interest in the European Union which we can accept in both form and content."
"Mr President, Mrs Billingham's report is welcome because, for once, it has enabled Mr Herman and myself to agree on the same text, although for somewhat different reasons perhaps."
"In the field of public services, that has not happened for a very long time."
"In addition, this is the final stage of a trend which began in September 1996 with the communication from the Commission."
"This put an end to a very lengthy dialogue of the deaf, involving on the one hand the Commission, which wished to impose its policy in the field of telecommunications, and on the other hand Parliament, which wanted at all costs to slow down the rather senseless wave of uncontrolled liberalization."
"We have undertaken to put greater controls on liberalization, particularly in the debates and discussions relating to directives on energy, electricity, gas and finally the postal services."
"The Commission then came to the conclusion that the world was not made up of binary oppositions, and that there were not on the one hand people wedded to the past who defended public services, as opposed to those who were wedded to the future and in favour of liberalization, but that we were working together for the achievement of the single market, and that this had no sense or future unless based on an appropriate balance and the complementary defence of both the general interest and the rules of the competitive market."
"As we were engaged in the Intergovernmental Conference, we all devoted considerable interest to modifications in the treaty."
"A number of us, possibly even the majority in the Parliament, would have liked to see a slight revision of article 90.2, which appeared to make services of general economic interest the only exception to the competitive market place."
"We would have wanted to develop this somewhat more."
"For other reasons, the Commission was far more reticent about the amendment to article 90, which it regarded as an essential article."
"Finally, the Treaty of Amsterdam gave birth to article 7.2, which of course does not go very far and is not very revolutionary, but does nevertheless affirm the legitimacy of general economic interests in a manner other than as exceptions to the competitive market."
"In that alone, the Treaty of Amsterdam is an important turning point at the legal level, and has been buttressed by a series of decisions from the Court of Justice, the Corbeau decision and the Almelo decision, as well as the decision relating to the monopoly on imports of gas, where the Court of Justice has made an approach which was no longer necessarily the rigid and rather dogmatic approach which it sometimes had, and which, we must say, was the approach of DG IV."
"Mr Commissioner, I am not complimenting you because you are my fellow countryman. I must acknowledge that not only have you changed considerably, but you have also worked well to improve the scale and the work of the Commission in the field of general economic interests."
"Communication is an element in this."
"The Billingham report indicates to you today that it will be necessary to go further, by means of a Green Paper, and a White Paper, that it would be better to define what is to be understood by a mission of general economic interest, in the same way that it will be necessary to specify the notion of general interest services other than from a purely consumerist conception."
"We are not only consumers."
"Recent debates on the notion of universal services within the Telecommunications Council have been extremely revealing in this respect."
"In conclusion, I suggest resolutely supporting the excellent report by our colleague, Mrs Billingham, and in particular to encourage the drafting of a Green and a White Paper to give us a truly adequate conception and good legislation in the field of general economic interest."
"Mr President, it required a great deal of perseverance and courage, including efforts within her own party, for our friend Angela Billingham to come up with a text on which there is a wide consensus, although it may not yet be 100 %, as we shall see."
"The debate was, in fact, polluted by three elements."
"Firstly, there was extraordinary confusion, throughout most of the discussion, between the concepts of general interest services, public services, public sector companies, state owned companies and universal services."
"People stirred all this up into some extraordinary stew, and everyone tried to extract the best bits of it to advance the cause they defended."
"The second element which interfered with the debate was the use that certain monopolies made of that very confusion, as they saw that their privileged positions were threatened."
"And finally, in some countries, and this is the third polluting element, the problem of public services has acquired a theological dimension."
"No rational or economic element could be brought into play."
"It was the state in all its splendour which should incarnate the general interest, and everything emanating from the market was suspect."
"Within this theology a number of extraordinarily adventurous tactics were deployed."
"There were public services whose characteristics were both permanent strikes and monstrous deficits."
"By so blackmailing companies, these public services created extraordinary advantages, stipends and privileges."
"Another point made the debate a difficult one."
"For some, it was a question of reducing the power of the Commission."
"Our friend Mr Desama has spoken of a cavalry charge."
"I say that fortunately - fortunately - this took place in telecommunications but despite the cavalry charge we are still ten years behind, Mr Desama, ten years behind the United States in a series of new telecommunications services."
"The only thing I regret is that the charge was only made with horses, because what we needed was tanks."
"That is what we really needed to crush the resistance of the conservatives in most countries."
"The conservatives are not always the ones you expect, anyway."
"Today they have put on progressive masks."
"Having said that, I would like to return to the draft itself, as we are in agreement about the basics."
"We have put forward amendments on two points only."
"We shall be deepening and supporting an amendment from the socialists, Amendment No 4 on paragraph 8."
"That we accept."
"We are not raising the demand to go further with the treaty, we have no illusions about that."
"We think that before we go further, we need an objective analysis of the factors for and against, on the basis of the figures and on no other basis."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate and I welcome very much the Commission's communication on which it is based."
"It was a very useful development of thinking in the area of services of general interest, trying to define some of the territory and to mark out what is appropriate for the European Union."
"We had a very difficult debate about this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and I congratulate the rapporteur on seeking to establish a consensus, which I believe will carry the report with a great majority here."
"She has done some very good work."
"The great concern that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party took to this debate was to ensure that we should be able to protect appropriate diversity."
"We have different regional experiences; we have different needs and capacities; we have different sectors in terms of technological development and the weight of that development by sector; and the current report, in terms of what is sets out as a future scenario and development of thinking, allows for a reflection on diversity and building on that diversity."
"It is also important that we avoid excessive horizontalism in an approach to this, and I believe that perhaps the first draft that we looked at the outset was excessively so."
"However, this time round it touches on some of the very important general issues but leaves open the possibility that case by case, sector by sector, we can carry the analysis forward as appropriate, and we welcome that."
"We place a very strong emphasis in the Liberal Group - and I am glad to say the rapporteur will take our only amendment to this report - on recalling the necessity as we develop our thesis about universality of service, quality of service and so on - and these issues are extremely important - of not abandoning our commitment - and, indeed, the treaty requirement - to have regard to competition."
"It is very important in terms of the market place we find ourselves in, because the modern consumer for the public service wants quality, choice and reasonable price, and competition is the best means of ensuring that, whatever the form of ownership."
"This report leaves that avenue open, and I therefore welcome it."
"Mr President, according to Mrs Billingham's report, public services are economic activities which are considered vital for citizens and society as a whole."
"This means their scope should not be limited - and even that would be something - to power and gas distribution services, telecommunications, transport and postal services."
"They also include other activities which, because they similarly supply essential needs and contribute to economic and social cohesion, must be provided continuously and equally to all, regardless of any criteria of economic and financial profitability."
"They exist to provide a complete range of public services in such a way that their goods and products are accessible to the least favoured populations and regions, and this purpose is also enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We must remember that in Portugal, for example, the liberalization of telecommunications and the privatization of their principal operator has led to a price increase for those most deprived of public services, in the name of economic profitability and competitiveness for the benefit of those who unjustifiably want to hold long-distance conversations."
"Although it is felt that certain services should remain under State control, the deciding factor should not be ownership."
"What matters is the service itself."
"We do however, question whether private operators should receive state aid to maintain the requirements of a service when they have benefitted from its privatization."
"With regard to the protection of consumers' rights, we also say that workers' organizations in target sectors for privatization must be consulted."
"The framework of these activities must be regulated, and there is good reason here to mention the principle of subsidiarity and its etymological meaning."
"It is true that some of those who have built the European Union are trying to change the names of certain activities, and to alter concepts that disturb their ultraliberal presuppositions."
"Since the beginning of the process of liberalizing and privatizing public service industries, the terms which have been most in evidence have been expressions such as 'universal services' and 'services of general interest' , but the expression and concept of 'public services' , which the treaty itself came to include, have not been extinguished."
"That is why we are emphasizing the definition and strengthening the concept."
"Mrs Billingham's report gives expression to our concerns."
"We congratulate her and hope she will accept our amendments, which would help us to vote in favour of her report, as we would like to do - in defence of public services and the service of the public."
"Mr President, the casualness with which the Commission's document and Mrs Billingham's report state that the European Union must have powers covering services of general interest is questionable."
"The inclusion of article 7d in the Treaty of Amsterdam may be received with great acclaim, but when after much effort the description ""general services' still remains extremely vague, the European authority becomes less sure."
"How do we get agreement on minimum standards without avoiding a deterioration in the average level of service provision in Europe?"
"I am very doubtful that the approach proposed here will lead to better services at lower consumer prices."
"According to the subsidiarity principle, the most important powers will have to remain with the Member States."
"Only general services with an obvious international dimension require minimum standards at European level."
"A charter is too heavy and unsuitable an instrument for this."
"The establishment of such a charter will probably require a great deal of time as there is no agreement on a clear definition of services of general economic interest."
"No one will deny that these services contribute to social and economic cohesion, but mutual solidarity for the benefit of weaker regions will primarily have to take shape within the Member States of the European Union before an additional contribution from European funds and initiatives is given."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Billingham."
"As many have said, this is a well-balanced, innovative and, dare I say, exciting report where European Union citizens are concerned."
"Why?"
"Because it actually seeks to address the needs of our people in a very direct way."
"For once the European Union is saying ""we care about you' and that general services that reflect community values and answer to the needs of the public are important and that the Union cannot live by sheer commercialism alone."
"It is also saying something absolutely critical in a liberal democracy: that general services are part of the infrastructure of citizenship."
"As you might imagine, I want to talk about public service broadcasting because it is very much a part of the infrastructure of citizenship."
"We lose it at our peril."
"It is what we might call a merit good, a very important term often forgotten."
"It is not measurable in normal market terms."
"Competition rules are not applicable in the normal way."
"Here I take issue with some of my colleagues here tonight."
"Naked competition in broadcasting has already proved what it will do."
"We would end up, quite simply, with a diet of sport, US film and chat shows."
"That is where it leads."
"Member States recognized this during the negotiations at the intergovernmental conference."
"As a result we got something very interesting: a protocol on public service broadcasting attached to the treaties that said public service broadcasting is an invaluable part of democracy."
"But what have we seen?"
"We have seen recently a Green Paper on the possible convergence between telecommunications and broadcasting where sadly, the Commission - or some elements of the Commission - have failed to recognize this point."
"Some commercial television can deliver some public service obligations."
"But if I take the example of the BBC - excuse my chauvinism momentarily - it is an example of a particular broadcasting ecology which citizens, I believe, have a right to."
"It is television, which puts the public interest first, not advertisers' or shareholders' interests."
"It is free to air."
"It is for every citizen in their majority and their minority interest, provides independent impartial news and information, education and, very importantly, facilitates mutual knowledge and understanding upon which our democracy depends."
"Finally, we look forward to a charter which spells out the basic entitlement to public service broadcasting as well as the other services mentioned tonight."
"It will do much for the popularity of the European Union when it recognizes that water is not a wristwatch, fax is not a film and a democracy is dependent on documentaries."
"Mr President, there is plenty of justification for the initiative we are examining, which demonstrates the importance of the supply of services of general interest and the terms in which it must be monitored."
"These services are determined by social and economic considerations, and especially cohesion, because there are cases where the cover and efficiency achieved by mere market forces are not enough."
"But the Commission's document and Mrs Billingham's report - and I also congratulate her - are perfectly clear. They emphasize that the general interest does not coincide with as public intervention, lack of concern for efficiency and non-payment by service users."
"It is important to make a factual distinction between the ends and the means, because in many cases the public interest is better served by private entities."
"In the case of non-profitable services, in remote geographical areas for example, they may be made a compulsory part of the consideration for the franchises granted."
"And in cases where competition is possible, consumers without much in the way of means will be the principal beneficiaries, as we have been seeing in the case of telephone services or air transport, for example, with the irreversible abolition of the old companies with their monopoly privileges - we still suffer from them in Portugal - which, it is claimed, serve a useful social function."
"There are also general reasons of efficiency and equity which require that, wherever possible, the beneficiaries should pay all, or at least part, of the costs of the services they receive."
"Thus we are promoting a more rational use of resources, in everyone's interest, and this also prevents the intolerable injustice that specially privileged strata of the population are often exempted from paying road tolls - or tips, in my country's case."
"The whole of society benefits from motorways and higher education, but these are semi-public goods with private benefits for people who travel or those who will earn more afterwards as a result of the degrees they gain."
"Apart from that, it prevents the allocation elsewhere of sparse resources that are much needed to satisfy collective requirements and provide social support for the poorest people, who really are in fundamental need of our attention."
"Mr President, the process of liberalization and of deregulation implemented at Community level imperils public services and has had negative consequences on employment and social conditions, without in any way benefitting users."
"Obsessed as it is by the principles of free competition, the Commission has a tendency to consider services rendered by the public service as pure commodities, without taking into account the social needs to which they are a response, and the specific historical features which have in many cases given rise to them."
"In response to the ultra free-market offensive, there has over the last few years arisen a movement of resistance, of reflection, of proposals and action in favour of the public services, and in particular the powerful strike of November/December 1995 in France."
"This movement, which our group permanently placed before the European Parliament, contributed to obtaining the inclusion of article 7d in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In spite of its limits, it is a point of support in the defence and promotion of public services."
"The report from Mrs Billingham is part of this movement, because it recognizes the place and role of services of general interest, which is positive."
"However, the report does not perhaps sufficiently call into question the involvement of competition rules, which is expressed in article 8."
"For this reason, our group has put forward some amendments, which we hope will be adopted to improve this text."
"The notion of universal service is advanced by the Commission as if it were some kind of fire-wall, but its content remains ambiguous and even dangerous, because its intent is minimum services, and hence it constantly threatens to level things down, to lead to a two-speed society, and hence to develop more exclusion."
"What is at stake through the defence of public services is a whole concept of society."
"Either we move towards aggravated social and regional inequalities, within the framework of competition between people and economies, or we act in favour of a society based on more solidarity, combatting social inequality, exclusion and unemployment."
"In Europe, public services are part of a fundamental choice between a Europe dominated by economic warfare and financial markets, on the one hand, and a people's Europe, a Europe of cooperation and social progress."
"The promotion of public services is a response to the imperative of national solidarity, of social cohesion, a means of ensuring equality of access and treatment for users, by providing guaranteed continuity, security and quality in services to citizens."
"Public service also provides for better management of the environment, and contributes to balanced town and country planning."
"We believe that public service must be renovated, and that by democratizing it, that is, by associating staff and users in the management of public services, and releasing those services from the financial pressures of the banks."
"Instead of wasteful competition, we believe in and hope to promote cooperation between public services, but also between the private and the public sector, to meet and satisfy requirements."
"Synergies between public services and industrial companies can also be developed, so contributing to the implementation of an industrial policy and the development of employment."
"Mr President, many thanks to Angela Billingham for this report."
"It is particularly significant that it comes from Great Britain."
"Under the previous government's policy even the city water supply was privatized."
"What was the competitive value of that?"
"Is the colour of the water coming out of the pipes different in the morning from what it is in the evening?"
"Water is obviously a public service."
"It is the elixir of life, an absolute basic right."
"What kind of democracy is it that fails to guarantee water for all?"
"A viable public service system is the basis of equality and democracy."
"For that reason it is good that the Amsterdam Treaty recognizes public services as immensely important and an essential principle of law in the EU."
"I believe that effective public services also inspire confidence in the European Union."
"Without them people's trust in the Union will diminish."
"Small-minded privatization must not come before common rights."
"The approval of this report is a historic occasion."
"While the old monopolies need a good shaking up, they should not be replaced by private monopolies or duopolies."
"In my view, the Union should not enlarge unless equality improves."
"Now borders between countries are falling away, but gulfs within states are deepening."
"Good public services help us to attain the things most essential to us: solidarity, equality, confidence, and the growth of all three."
"And that is the basis of democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a proposal by the Commission to make an addition to article 3 of the EC Treaty."
"According to it, the activity of the Community should include a contribution to supporting services which are oriented to the common good."
"In my assessment, that is dangerous for integration and competition policy, and in my opinion it must be rejected."
"Writing it into the treaty would mean that state services of general interest would represent a dimension to which it would no longer be possible to set any limit."
"Such an article would also have an effect on the Community's competition rules and regulations, and also on the subsidy regulations, and in contrast to EU policy, which is based on opening up markets and privatization, this is the establishment of monopolies and preferential treatment of public companies, which cannot be in the interests of Europe."
"We should ask ourselves what really belongs in state services of general interest."
"I think, as little as possible."
"In my opinion, the state must fulfil the following tasks, and it is sometimes good to remember them."
"First, it must ensure internal and external security."
"Second, it must ensure independent dispensation of justice, and third, it must support the sense of community of society by creating a balance between advantage and disadvantage."
"Fourth, it must also fill the gaps in public life which are not filled by private business initiative."
"But it does not have to operate a state airline, a state post and telephone company and a state railway company."
"Where there is competition, it need not hinder it by introducing customs duties on imports and providing subsidies."
"The most objective judge of services is and remains the market and not the state."
"It determines the value of a service through competition."
"So for a state or society, an urgent task is to organize a market, and not services of general interest."
"I hope that we will not decide the opposite tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Angela Billingham very sincerely on the excellent report she has prepared and the Commission on its statement."
"The subject is of the greatest importance, because it deals with services of general interest in Europe, for which socialists have fought so hard and which have now been enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is indeed the case that both article 7d and the declaration in the final Minute provide guarantees for all those who consider that services of general interest, or 'public services' , as our rapporteur systematically and quite rightly refers to them, are economic activities which are vital to citizens and society."
"This acknowledgment in the new treaty, inasmuch as it considers such services as one of the common values of Europe and a Community principle, like full respect for the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, particularly as regards equality of treatment, quality and continuity of services, undoubtedly represents an enormous vote of confidence in a Europe centred not only on companies and competition, but above all on citizens and their rights and the European social model."
"Social cohesion can only be achieved if there is a coherent social infrastructure."
"Services of general interest are by definition the principal component of that infrastructure."
"One of the essential problems affecting public services is competition."
"Competition cannot be justified as an end in itself where public services are concerned."
"Its value lies in its effect on the standard and quality of the services provided to citizens."
"Legally speaking, general services can be owned by the public, local authorities, cooperatives or private entities."
"The essential thing is that service suppliers should guarantee quality services, irrespective of the type of ownership or organization, that their workers should be properly specialized, trained, motivated, paid and employed, and that citizens, whichever part of the country they live in, can have the benefit of the services due to them in identical conditions."
"This is the general service model I also support for the Europe we are in the process of creating."
"Thank you, Mr van Miert."
"Mr Desama, the floor is yours."
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor on a pointr of personal explanation, because I like a joke, but there are limits."
"So thank you, Karel, for alluding to my position as a teacher, and it is precisely the teacher who is going to teach you a little lesson."
"The first thing is that before you criticize your teacher, you should first listen to what the teacher said."
"I never said that article 7d replaced article 90.2."
"At no time did I ever say that and it would be absurd to say so."
"So you should have listened to me more before you gave that reply."
"The second lesson relates to the decision concerning monopoly on imports."
"I cited that decision because it is important for one thing, Mr Commissioner."
"This time, in its decision, the Court of Justice said that it is the Commission's responsibility to provide the proof that the monopoly is an impediment to free competition."
"And it is on that point that the decision of the Court of Justice is clearly an innovation."
"Mr President, the important thing about this report is not just the amendments that the Commission will accept, but whether or not the Commissioner would sit down with our rapporteur early in the New Year and explore the ideas in the report to see what can be progressed between the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"In spite of the rhetoric that we have all been involved in this evening, there are some very concrete ideas in Mrs Billingham's report."
"What we would like to do is to progress some of those concrete ideas."
"If tonight you could give a commitment that you are willing to do that then certainly in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of the European Parliament we will try and take up those ideas and work with you to develop them."
"Obviously we are prepared to do so."
"But I think the right way to do it is to discuss the initiatives which the Commission develops in different sectors."
"Every sector has its own specifics and in light of the specifics of the sector we need to determine what kind of public service obligation - or whatever you call it - needs to be assured."
"This is how we have to work together."
"I certainly will be available to anyone - not just to the rapporteur - to make sure that we do not take risks as far as serving people everywhere in the European Union is concerned."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner van Miert."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"Denominations in euros"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0386/97) on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, concerning the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euros coins intended for circulation (C4-0598/97-97/0154(SYN)) (rapporteur: Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this will not be anywhere near as lively as Commissioner van Miert was when he gave his presentation."
"Allow me to comment that he was today the liveliest speaker of the whole part-session."
"On the second reading of my report on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins, I would like to point out again briefly that at first reading the majority of Parliament wanted and voted for essential changes to three points."
"First, to reduce the number of coins from eight to six."
"Second, to create a relationship between the actual size and the form and shape."
"Third, to exclude nickel from all parts of the coin which come into contact with human skin."
"I would like to justify this again briefly."
"We now have a total of eight coins, and in the whole EU and many nations of the EU there are at the moment six coins on average, sometimes even less."
"If we start from the fact that for many sections of the population, such as blind people for instance, it is very difficult to handle a large number of coins, this would be an example of a reason for reducing the total number of coins."
"Secondly, if we start from the fact that electronic money is constantly growing, this would be another reason."
"The next argument, that the coin should grow with its value to avoid confusion of sizes, was also an important demand."
"For instance, the 5 cent coin, at 21.75 mm, is exactly the same size as the 20 cent coin, which makes things extremely difficult for people with disabilities."
"The third issue is human health, an especially important aspect."
"There was also a majority on this point in Parliament at first reading."
"If we say that nickel should not to come into contact with human skin, we are only following other EU directives, which established this rule for other areas of daily need long ago."
"The report was accepted in November with a large majority, but rejected by the Council."
"On 20 November, the Council adopted a common opinion on the proposed order."
"The European Parliament had decided by a large majority, but the Council only accepted Amendment Nos 8 and 12."
"I was disappointed that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy did not take advantage of its political opportunities in the last part-session."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy practically anticipated the Council."
"There are now a few amendments, and incidentally I support all of them, but they are a long way from the point we were at during the November meeting."
"What could we have done?"
"Parliament could again adopt, by an absolute majority of its Members, all or some of the amendments which were rejected by the Council at first reading, as an amendment to the common position."
"We have this option according to the procedure under article 189c, and we could have done it."
"If the Commission or the Council show in the debate in the House that they are not prepared to accept Parliament's desired amendments to a sufficient extent, Parliament could again reject the common position, and that is what I want and have proposed."
"If the Council does not accept certain amendments, we can also break down the common position, and only accept it under conditions, that is, if the Council does not accept the amendments which Parliament has adopted, the common position is not approved."
"Why do I repeat that again?"
"I do not think we have not taken advantage of these opportunities in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"I would like to point out that the euro we will soon have, and which will certainly go down in European Union history as a successful and unique financial project, has the consequence that people will have the coins in their hands every day."
"Problems like confusion about size, like nickel, which is recognized to be a health problem, and many other points in my report will face the population every day, so the euro coin is important and these problems will come back to us as those who are politically responsible."
"I would therefore like to plead once again that we should take advantage of the political opportunities we have in Parliament."
"Mr President, as you know Sweden has decided to remain outside EMU."
"It is also my conviction that Sweden is going to remain outside monetary union for the foreseeable future."
"There is therefore no immediate Swedish interest in the design of the euro coin."
"However, I would still like to say a few words on the health aspects with regard to nickel in the outer layers of the coin."
"10 % of all women and 1-2 % of all men in Western Europe have developed a nickel allergy."
"These proportions are increasing, and 20 % of young women in Western Europe have this kind of illness."
"Nickel is the most common cause of contact allergies in the industrialized world."
"A person who has become allergic to nickel keeps this allergy for the rest of their life."
"The allergy appears mainly in the form of eczema on the hands or on that part of the body which comes into contact with nickel."
"Cashiers, bank employees, waitresses, and so on, daily handle large numbers of coins, which are often made from nickel alloys."
"This coins deposit nickel on contact with the skin."
"It can also be shown that nickel is even passed by hand to nickelfree coins and notes."
"We have also proved that eczema on the hands of people allergic to nickel is made worse when they handle coins which contain nickel."
"Nickel in coins does not cause allergies, but makes the problem worse for people who have already developed this illness."
"A decision to introduce coins containing nickel in the outer layers could prove very difficult to change and could cause serious health problems for a growing proportion of Europe's population, particularly for women, since they are often dominant in the professions where nickel coins are handled."
"For this reason at least the outer layer of the coins should be nickel-free."
"In this case health reasons should take priority over economic considerations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, seeing the participation this evening, I can only say that the debate is obviously about small change."
"It seems pretty unimportant to all of us, but the scale of this small change is 70 billion coins, and for this reason we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have taken it very seriously so far, and we have seriously tried to participate in the discussion about creating the new coins, by proposing amendments among other things."
"The mint directors and finance ministers saw it otherwise."
"They have prepared texts, proposed strategies."
"But the Council did not accept what we discussed here, with quite small exceptions."
"My personal opinion is essentially that what we discussed here at first reading was right, and that what we decided was right."
"The breakdown of the coins, the increasing sizes, recognition by the blind and visually handicapped, also the old, traditional minting methods - all things which we have discussed and decided here - seem vitally important to me."
"Last time we also defended the national side of the coins."
"That is now written into the Council's report, but we are very sad that our opinions were not accepted here."
"However, my opinion is that what Mrs Sollwedel-Schäfer demanded here, in other words, the reintroduction of the earlier amendments, does not take us much further."
"The scenario is clear."
"In my opinion we should concentrate on two amendments, as we did in the economic committee, i.e. first the whole range of demands which have already been mentioned: increasing size, recognition of coins by blind people, recognition of coins by machines, protecting the larger coins from fraud."
"We have proposed this and got it through the economic committee."
"We should also decide on it in Parliament."
"Secondly, we should pursue the matter of gold."
"We are not suffering from gold fever."
"People might have the idea that just before Christmas we caught gold fever, but we did not."
"We want there to be a 100 euro gold coin, which would continue old traditions and at the same time, as we have argued here, reduce Europe's gold reserves."
"I think it is important to state again that protecting coins from forgery is very important to us, particularly as there are approximately 6 million coin-operated machines in Europe."
"This involves the choice of alloys and recognition by machines."
"In this connection, let it be said that obviously not only the coins must be safe from forgery, but also all the notes."
"We have emphasized that many times."
"They must meet the highest security standards, so that they are also safe from forgery in future."
"Let me plead once again for the amendments proposed by the economic committee and accepted there by a large majority to be accepted here in the House as well."
"Mr President, it is not possible for Council to send us its decisions and for Parliament then to do nothing, even if it decided quite differently at first reading; it had decided to use metals that were not just nordic gold which is a metal primarily produced by certain states which will not be joining the euro."
"Moreover, the other choice of metal is just copper, and I wonder why."
"There are no plans to use stainless steel, which is a European metal; 20 % of world currency is made of stainless steel."
"This is an unacceptable situation."
"I wonder what the final solution will be."
"Finally, Council has relied on the fact that time is running out and no other decision can be taken, but that is certainly not true."
"The whole thing is still an insult to Parliament, which has expressed certain views and cannot just react to what the Council has decided."
"Mr President, what seemed to have become a purely technical report was suddenly given weight by the debate about the nickel in the coins and the national face."
"Parliament's view on how euro coins should look was raised at first reading."
"I endorse the opinion of the rapporteur when she says that we should have fewer coins because the retail business will run into difficulties with a larger number of coins than we have now."
"Unfortunately, the Council has dismissed the majority of the amendments and as long as the Council remains united it can do that."
"The fact that Parliament only has advisory powers in this area plays a part in this."
"The coin will become one of the most visible results of European integration, and respect would have been shown for the citizens if we had been able to influence this process through Parliament."
"As a group we think nickel is acceptable in relation to combatting fraud."
"The Council denied this Parliament the right to submit an amendment on the national face because it was alleged to have nothing to do with technical specifications."
"As the Council knows very well, that is complete nonsense."
"To enable the Dutch to keep the edge inscription God zij met ons -God be with us - the edge has also been declared part of the national face."
"The edge and the national face therefore play a major part in the technical specifications which are needed to make the coins recognizable for the visually impaired, and for vending machines."
"Thus we believe that the national face is not just a graphic aspect, as the Council states, but most certainly a technical aspect, and the old Amendment No 28 therefore deserves a full place in the Council Resolution, and not merely in the recitals."
"Mr President, I believe that the proposed regulation will send a further strong message that the euro is on the way and all EMU participants are playing their part."
"The aim of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy's first amendment is to establish the principle of a single set of coins which would be designed so as to enable the visually impaired and the elderly, who have the greatest difficulty in distinguishing coins, to accept them more readily."
"The second amendment is a proposal to introduce a gold 100 euro coin for collectors."
"However the Treaty only provides for the harmonization of coins intended for circulation."
"I am pleased that associations representing the visually impaired have been consulted on the euro coins."
"Furthermore, Recital 8 of the regulation underlines the importance of the relationship between the diameter and value of the coins, to which reference has been made."
"Our group believes that the coins, which will have one national and one common face, can be more easily recognized by those who use them by features such as their weight, shape, colour and diameter."
"In the case of most coins in use at the moment, the size of the coins is not directly linked to their face value."
"This can prove to be a difficulty for those who are using them."
"As regards euro notes, we should not overlook the needs of the visually impaired and older people."
"We should ensure that for the visually impaired, in particular, the notes are distinguishable by touch."
"Perhaps there might be a response to that."
"As regards the production of a 100 euro gold coin which for collectors might seem a very seductive proposition, it would be absolutely essential, if this proposal was taken up, to ensure that the cost of producing a gold coin did not exceed its face value, thereby imposing totally unacceptable costs on the Member States."
"On the other hand, could not the revenue from the sale of the 100 euro coins be transferred to the budget?"
"Taking account of these comments our group will be supporting this report."
"Mr President, the euro, and particularly the coin, is certainly a quintessential component of Europe."
"It shows on one side what we have in common, and on the other, individuality, as a symbol of Europe."
"I have seen the first designs in Austria, but I was somewhat surprised that ""Euro' is printed above the euro, but ""Eurocent' is printed above the cent."
"This could cause confusion."
"Also, the size of the coins is different, and for non-experts it will really be quite difficult to distinguish the eight coins, instead of the six which have been normal up to now."
"I will not dwell on the fact that many tills are equipped with six divisions, and must now be converted to eight."
"The eight coins will also result in enormous production costs, and given that electronic money will soon be introduced, we are faced with a mass of costs which could have been avoided."
"I also wonder how the order will be placed."
"Will there be an invitation to tender with government orders?"
"Will there be a competition?"
"We have heard that we need 70 billion coins, so the costs will be enormous - how do these costs appear to citizens?"
"Finally, I also believe that the 100 Euro gold coin can be a symbol of confidence in the new currency, even as a commemorative coin, even in a limited edition."
"I believe Europe has an important task here, and we must improve the coins a lot."
"Parliament made some proposals about this at first reading, but I believe it will be some time before we get the ideal system."
"This need for improvement must be flagged up today, and I hope that it will be carried out in the second round."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour I shall be brief, but first of all I want to tell you that the Commission is delighted that Parliament has been able to take a decision this evening on the second reading of the report by Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer on the technical characteristics of coins."
"Indeed, this is an important question."
"The euro, and I say this often, is Europe in the pockets of our citizens."
"Consequently, coins are the way in which Europe takes on a real shape, as our citizens see it."
"This is the reason why the euro is not just a matter for the financial markets, it is a matter for the citizens, and it is for this reason that the regulation must be particularly carefully dealt with."
"As Mr Hoppenstedt emphasized, there are now 70 billion coins in circulation."
"This means several tens of billions of coins to be minted between now and 1 January 2002."
"This will be done, Mr Rübig, by national administrations, in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, according to the procedures of invitations to tender, or of production which apply in each of the member countries."
"I know that the formal decision of the Ministers of Finance can only be taken after 2 May, immediately after the decision of the Heads of State and of Government, but for technical and practical reasons which you will understand, in the light of the number of coins, you can appreciate how important it is to get this matter wrapped up at Council level, in terms of principles, in terms of a formal agreement, before the end of this year."
"The proposal before you today at second reading is based on in-depth work carried out for many months by the monetary authorities in the Member States and this has provided a guarantee of industrial feasibility, respecting the timetable agreed at Madrid in December 1995 by the Heads of State and of Government."
"I would add that this is the result of a long process of consultation, of concertation with all professional sectors concerned, with associations of consumers and with organizations representing the blind and visually impaired."
"The proposal made by the Commission is based on criteria of acceptability by public opinion - and we have tested that - on the basis of criteria of technical feasibility - and here we have assurances - and on public health criteria, because of course we do not want to take any risks with public health."
"This proposal is therefore a balanced one, and it meets both industrial constraints and the requirements of users."
"Some of you, as was the case in the debate at first reading, criticized the number of coins."
"I wish to specify that the system is based on the experience acquired from all the Member States, and it ensures consistency with the unit values planned for notes."
"The number and series of coins have been defined as a response to the requirements of all consumers, taking into account the diversity of national situations currently existing."
"Today, in some Member States, the value of the smallest coin in circulation is around 1 euro cent."
"Consensus has been reached on the size and shape of the coins, thanks, I would remind you, to the shape known as the ""Latin flower' , which is not totally round, for the 20 cent piece."
"Consensus was also reached by defining three groups of coins, with three different colours, differentiating each coin within each group in terms of thickness and edging."
"Consequently, the preoccupations of the visually impaired have been very, very largely, I would say almost entirely, taken into consideration."
"The technical specifications also represent high levels of protection against forgery, and this is particularly important for coins of high unit value, and here I am thinking of the 1 and 2 euro pieces."
"Finally, the technical specifications meet the concerns expressed in the area of public health, and provide the necessary assurances in that respect."
"Here I want to say that the use of nickel in the Commission's proposal will be substantially reduced in Europe, as it will be limited to the 1 and 2 euro pieces, and that the volume of coins containing nickel will fall to 8 % of the total coins currently in circulation in Europe, that is, contractually by 75 %."
"I would add that the Toxicity and Ecotoxicity Committee, the scientific committee we approached on this proposal, supported this."
"When the Ecofin Council adopted the common position last month, it took up the five amendments the Commission had accepted in its modified proposal."
"These relate, I would remind you, to the need for a reliable system, an effective system, and a system acceptable to all the citizens of the European Union."
"Your rapporteur's recommendation for second reading retables two amendments."
"As at first reading, the Commission cannot accept them."
"But let me specify the Commission's position on one of Mrs Randzio-Plath's amendments, on the introduction of 100 euro gold coins."
"We have looked closely at this amendment, and from a legal point of view, the Commission cannot accept it within the framework of article 105a.2 which relates to euro denominations intended for circulation."
"Indeed, this proposal is in contradiction both to the introduction of the 100 euro note, which was already decided, and to the opposing view of central bankers, with regard to the circulation of such a coin."
"However, in order to support the initiative, the Commission has suggested that all of the monetary authorities of the Member States should consider issuing a gold 100 euro collector's coin."
"This proposal should meet with the approval of the various Member States, and the Commission will keep you informed."
"I think that would be heavily symbolic."
"With the adoption of the regulation on the coins, the essential core of the arrangements required for moving to a single currency are now in place."
"As it is late, I shall not go into the important decisions taken by the European Council at Luxembourg last week relating both to the coordination of economic policy, the euro Council, and the representation and definition of the external position of the euro in international bodies, but today we can say that all of the preparatory technical work relating to the euro is virtually complete."
"This evening, on this eve of the New Year, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support throughout these months, for its work, for our collaboration, and for its commitment to a process leading up to the introduction of the euro, according to the timetable and the conditions laid down by the treaty."
"The final technical preparations, which are now just details really, will be completed at the end of May 1998."
"The Commission is now working actively on this, and will naturally keep your Parliament strictly informed and closely associated with its efforts. The Commission will be bringing together - and I make this announcement this evening - a new round table on practical aspects of the euro, with all concerned partners, and of course with your Parliament."
"This round table will take place on 26 February in Brussels."
"The way is now open for the advent of the euro, and the political decisions will be taken on 2 May."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner de Silguy."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, has a question."
"Mr President, I know it is very late, but I would not be doing my job properly if I did not take up Mr Hoppenstedt's question."
"Perhaps Mr Hoppenstedt will stay here for a moment."
"First, I wanted to say to you, Mr de Silguy, that from my and our point of view cooperation and mutual information went very well."
"But I cannot understand the Commission and the Council not accepting these logically convincing amendments, which were accepted by a clear majority in Parliament and which really - as my colleague said - correspond to the interests of female citizens."
"I really cannot understand that."
"But now to my question: Mr Hoppenstedt put a very important question about the minting of coins."
"Is there an invitation to tender, or is it like our showers in the Members' offices, another open door for corruption and dishonest enrichment?"
"I would like to take up that question: is there an invitation to tender?"
"Yes or no?"
"I would like an answer this evening, one way or the other."
"Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, perhaps I expressed myself badly, but I thought I had replied to Mr Hoppenstedt on that point."
"Every country must manufacture the stock of coinage required for its own market."
"Each country must also produce the stock of notes required for its own market."
"That is the principle adopted."
"So once we have the technical regulations, once we have the decision on the Community face of the coin, it will be the responsibility of every member country, in application of the principle of subsidiarity, firstly to define the graphics of the national face of the coin, and I think that a number of countries have already done so, and secondly to make the technical arrangements required for the production of the coins in question."
"The same will apply to the manufacture of euro coinage as already occurs in the manufacture of national currency coins in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries."
"The manufacture will take place in accordance with the regulation applicable in each of the countries."
"In some countries these are virtually state-run administrations, in other cases there are private companies and in yet others there are calls for competitive tender."
"This is a question which is the responsibility of each of the Member States."
"Manufacture will take place in the same conditions of legality and regularity and as currently apply in the production of national coinage."
"I only wanted to ask, must these states then issue invitations to tender for eight coins, or would six be enough?"
"For eight coins, because the intention is to circulate eight coins in all of the Member States."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.11 a.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you may notice, the three presidents are all arriving late. Please forgive us."
"The only time we could hold the usual three-way talks was this morning at 8 a.m. It was not easy, and even now we have still not finished, because there were delicate matters to be settled between the three institutions."
"European Council in Luxembourg - Six months of the Luxembourg Presidency"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by the Council and statement by the Commission on the European Council meetings of 21 November and 12-13 December in Luxembourg, and-the statement by the Council on the six months of the Luxembourg Presidency.The President-in-Office of the Council has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout my long political career I have learnt that it is necessary to be economic with the term ""historic' ."
"Nevertheless I do not hesitate to use the term with respect to the Luxembourg decision to launch the accession process with ten countries of east and central Europe and Cyprus."
"The new Europe which is being drawn up under our very eyes for once and for all erases the old lines of division and the scars of past wars between brothers!"
"The path is from now on open towards unification of the continent, a unification marked by democracy, liberty and prosperity."
"The lunch in Luxembourg, which brought together the Heads of State and of Government of the fifteen member and eleven applicant countries was an emotional moment, and one which personally moved me a great deal."
"The representatives of the eleven applicant countries have all experienced an historic occasion."
"And I mean all the applicant countries, for the European Council, in line with the approach set out in Agenda 2000, insisted on the inclusive character of the accession process."
"All the States concerned are called on to join us, and all will receive aid and assistance to be able to do this as quickly as possible."
"Some, we know, are more advanced than others, and will be able, as of April, to commence concrete negotiations."
"For the others, we will speed up the efforts to prepare them for future negotiations."
"The President of the European Council, Jean-Claude Juncker, has just described the details of the agreement reached in Luxembourg."
"I can therefore be brief. I would not want to fail, however, to pay homage to Jean-Claude Juncker personally - and via him to all of the presidency team - for the way in which they have conducted the work, in Luxembourg and before."
"(Loud applause) Mr President, the euphoria of the moment must not hide the difficulty of the task awaiting us."
"The discussions in Luxembourg gave us a prior taste of this difficulty."
"We are perhaps experiencing a fairy tale, but all fairy tales have their crises, their tears, their moments of fear."
"Enlargement to the east and to the south, for the reasons stated in Agenda 2000, will be an arduous task."
"The distance to be covered by our future Member States is considerable."
"As far as the European Union itself is concerned, deep reforms will be necessary: institutional reforms, political reforms and the establishment of a new financial framework."
"But, and I will say this from the outset, the issue of unification of the continent obliges us to overcome the difficulties and get down to the task at hand with determination."
"The problems, real, serious ones, are perfectly masterable and manageable."
"But they are only so if we have clear ideas and if we agree to deal with the problems within the context of the whole."
"This is precisely the approach of Agenda 2000, where the different factors make up a single, dissociable whole."
"The Luxembourg European Council confined itself to giving a few broad indications; the essential thing there was to launch the process of accession."
"It was understandable that the Member States did not want to show their hands at the beginning of a difficult negotiation process."
"But I believe they have clearly understood that the common agricultural policy will have to be reformed, that structural actions will have to be reviewed, that the future financial framework will have to be strict."
"The Commission will present its detailed proposals in the spring."
"It will try its best to reconcile ambition and solidarity with realism."
"And I am counting on the fact that, whilst defending their individual interests, the Member States will measure up to the issue: the unification of our continent along the lines of a community model that has served us so well up to now."
"Mr President, let me say a word about Turkey."
"When the emotion has subsided, we will see, I am sure, that the Luxembourg European Council is a crucial step in our relations with this important partner."
"Why?"
"Firstly because, for the first time in a long while, the European Union has a clear and unified position with regard to this country."
"Secondly because this position is consistent and, in my view, perfectly correct."
"The offer made to Turkey is concrete and substantial, whatever Ankara's disappointed reaction."
"In fact, the European Union proposes to open a path for Turkey's future membership, to launch a European strategy for Turkey which will enable that country to prepare itself for accession - this strategy includes both the European Conference and a substantial strengthening of bilateral relations - and finally, to revive the elements of cooperation already in place, including the financial protocol."
"What are we asking in exchange?"
"Respect for the principles of good neighbourliness, recourse to the International Court of the Hague in case of territorial disagreements, support for the resolution of the Cyprus problem and support for the latter's accession to the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, is it really so exorbitant to ask this of a partner who wants to join us?"
"I think not."
"Mr President, I would say that the second important issue for the Luxembourg Council was, once again, the single currency."
"Everything is now in place for a decision, another historic one, on 2 and 3 May, regarding the participants in the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"The Heads of State and of Government have resolved the problems that were raised."
"There was some agitation, irritation even, but the result is there, and the main thing is that this result seems to me to be completely appropriate with regard to the coordination of economic policies."
"The Ecofin Council is, and will remain, the main authority for coordination and decision making, but this will not prevent informal discussions from being held between ministers of countries participating in the euro, regarding questions linked to the common management of the euro."
"The discussions will take place - and this is a further guarantee - in the presence of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Luxembourg presidency is ending with a historic success."
"This success must not hide the progress achieved in many other areas, thanks to the constant effort of a presidency oriented completely towards the common good and towards service to the European Union, thanks also to excellent cooperation with the European Parliament and the Commission."
"It has been an excellent six months for Europe."
"A few examples are sufficient to illustrate this."
"The special summit in November on employment opened up a new stage in employment strategy with the adoption of guidelines for national policies in this area."
"The taxation agreement achieved brings movement into an area which has, for a long time, been blocked."
"The liberalization of the gas market, added to that already achieved for electricity, places a new stone in the building of the internal market."
"In terms of foreign policy, the European Union has just shown - on two occasions - to what point it wishes to play a role on the international scene by presenting a unique and strong position."
"At Kyoto, the result achieved regarding climatic protection - without being ideal, far from it - was considerable and that is thanks to the action of the European Union."
"In Geneva the European Union has once more played a pivotal role in the negotiations with the World Trade Organization, this time regarding financial services."
"The agreement achieved surpassed our expectations and will greatly benefit European companies."
"And I await with impatience the day when the European Union will be able to show the same spirit of cohesion and determination in the area of foreign policy and common security."
"Much other progress has been achieved over these last six months, but I will stop here."
"I am very pleased with the progress noted, and with the extremely positive response that our proposals have received. I sincerely congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency which has trodden a faultless path, under the leadership of Jean-Claude Juncker."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a European Council which for the first time has concentrated exclusively on the core question of the last decade of this century, the common fight against unemployment in the Member States of the Union; a European Council which has fired the starting gun for the solution of the core question of Europe in the first decade of the next century, bringing the people of the whole continent together in a union of freedom, democracy and economic development; a budget in which, together with Parliament, they have put through the principles of thrift, solidarity and the ability of the Union to act."
"An exemplary and successful effort of the Presidency for sensible cooperation between the Council and Parliament in all areas of Union policy; that, Mr President of the European Council, was the great Presidency of a small country!"
"My party supports the decisions of the European Council of 12 and 13 December on the start of the process of expanding the Union."
"They correspond to the baseline which my party supported in the discussion procedure in our Chamber."
"First, to start the accession procedure with all applicant countries simultaneously."
"Second, to start the accession negotiations first with five plus one, and third, by intensive introductory discussions and strengthened assistance, to contribute to making the start of concrete negotiations with each of the remaining five possible, as soon as possible."
"I welcome what President Juncker said about Turkey."
"My party thought the offer the European Council made to Turkey was already very generous."
"Some thought even too generous."
"We say now that Turkey should think about its interests and use the chance the offer provides, instead of withdrawing into a sulk!"
"Also, the most important result of the summit is not Turkey's reaction but the fact that the summit gave the green light for the start and the method of accession of the people of Eastern Europe to the European Union."
"We look towards the future, and I say that the decision to start the accession process is as nothing compared to the decisions the European Union will have to make in the next few years if enlargement is to be successful."
"We shall have to prepare ourselves for long and difficult negotiations, because if it actually happens in the next five, six, or seven years, the strength of the willingness and enthusiasm for accession of the people of Eastern Europe will sometimes be tested."
"But the test which our Union will have to pass is even more difficult."
"The reform of agricultural policy, the structural funds, and the financing of the enlargement, will all show one thing very quickly: that the enlargement does not come at zero cost."
"It will demand willingness to reform, concessions, readiness to compromise and sacrifice from all, I underline all, Member States of the Union."
"And the Union will not only be tested for perseverance, but also for courage and farsightedness."
"That applies particularly to reform of the institutions."
"My party regrets that the Luxembourg European Council said nothing more about that than to confirm Amsterdam."
"We insist that the Union needs substantial reform before the first accession by a new Member State."
"(Applause) The start of the enlargement process must also be the start of a great discussion by all the social forces in the European Union, a discussion about the future of the Union itself and thus of Europe."
"This discussion, ladies and gentlemen, must also take place here in our Chamber, with greater vigour."
"The introduction of the euro and enlargement present us all with the question of the future constitution of our Union."
"They present us with the question of the future boundaries of the Union."
"The enlargement must have and will have boundaries."
"There must be more things in Europe than between heaven and earth, to quote Shakespeare, more than just in or out of the European Union."
"We must discuss them!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1950s our fathers had the courage and far-sightedness to abolish the thousand-year old antagonism between France and Germany in a European Community."
"For the first time for a thousand years, our generation of politicians has the opportunity to unite the whole of Europe on the basis of the free will of its peoples."
"Let us show that we have the same courage and the same farsightedness as our fathers."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Presidents of the European Council and Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in the event that the negotiations with the ten countries from central and eastern Europe and with Cyprus are concluded positively, Europe transcending east and west becomes a fact."
"That is why the European summit in Luxembourg is an historic milestone in the history of European unification."
"The brave vision of the founders, of the fathers of a communal Europe prevails once more."
"Europe unites in peace and freedom because it has accepted a revolutionary principle in international relations, namely that of Community integration."
"The European Parliament wanted to avoid a new division, which would have left some countries at the side of the road, despite their enormous efforts to breathe new life into their democracies and market economies."
"The European summit sided with this policy."
"It offers all candidates the opportunity to negotiate with the Union as from the spring of 1998, even if the speed of these negotiations may vary according to the degree of preparation in each country."
"The shadow hanging over the success of Luxembourg comes from Turkey."
"Europe had expected this country to accord actively with the principles of democracy and the state of law that apply in the European Union."
"To us it is evident that the rift in the political dialogue with Ankara must not continue, but it is equally clear to us that no solution for Cyprus is possible without a climate of trust and dialogue, where there are no threats or blackmail."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to pay tribute to the Luxembourg Presidency, which has done exceptional work in perfect dialogue with the European Parliament."
"I congratulate Jean-Claude Juncker on his personal achievement, in his strategic role as President-in-Office of the European Council, but also as President of Ecofin and the Employment Council."
"I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his entire team."
"The summit on employment placed this new dimension, which had previously been missing and which is a big issue for our citizens, on the European agenda once and for all."
"At the same time you have achieved an important breakthrough in the tax system."
"The Council has approved a package with a code of conduct laid down by the Member States for a tax system covering companies and savings balances."
"Our appreciation is increased by the progress in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, spurred on by our former colleague Marc Fischbach, in the fight against international crime."
"But we are also worried."
"May I request confirmation from the President of the Council of the positive interpretation of point 3 of the conclusions, in particular the point that institutional reform will precede enlargement?"
"We also find a paradox, as do you, between an increasingly coherent and structured core around the Euro Council and an eventual enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States."
"We would see no paradox if we had resigned ourselves to a multi-speed Europe."
"But we do not accept that, and our ambition remains to create a widened and cohesive Union, which is why we support the declaration of the three countries who wish to make a new enlargement dependent on preparatory institutional reform."
"That reform is badly needed to reconcile the consequences of the two dynamics, namely the dynamic of the euro and the dynamic of the enlargement."
"Another worry of course concerns the financial prospects."
"Our fellow citizens undoubtedly value vigilant management of financial resources."
"But they also realize that no price can be put on every day of peace; that in the short term the enlargement will imply a cost that we will have to carry together, but in the long term it will be an asset for the entire continent."
"We therefore hope that the coming months will not be poisoned by prosaic discussions on the appropriate return, and that the financial debate will not gain the upper hand over our political ambitions."
"The family portrait, with 26 Heads of State and of Government, meant a great deal more than the traditional picture of an international forum."
"The 110 million citizens who are called to cooperate with us, will have to make enormous efforts to integrate their economies into the European Union."
"But they also have a compass."
"They have a horizon which is approaching."
"Over the coming months and years let us exercise our immense responsibility during the bridging period up to their accession into the Union in a dignified way."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Juncker, President of the European Council, in particular, along with the Luxembourg Presidency, for the remarkable energy they have shown to ensure that the two successive Luxembourg summits led to concrete results and to a balance sheet of decisions that are of a very high quality."
"The decision taken in Luxembourg, on 12 December 1997, by the Heads of State and of Government of the fifteen governments, to commence accession negotiations with the ten countries of east and central Europe and with Cyprus as from the beginning of next year, is an historic event of major importance."
"The effect of this decision will be to put an end once and for all to the division of Europe, one of the most dreadful consequences of the Second World War."
"In order to avoid this decision remaining a virtual reality and to ensure that it is lasting, a great deal remains to be done; I am tempted to say the hardest remains to be done."
"The train has been placed on the tracks but, for the moment, it is going through a tunnel and its passengers are unaware of the countryside they are going to discover at the end of the tunnel."
"In the circumstances their anxiety is understandable."
"According to well-worn tradition, the issues likely to upset institutional reform - the adaptation of the common agricultural policy to the new challenges of an enlarged Europe and the rural exodus, the financing of common policies and the financing of enlargement - have been postponed until later."
"But one day we will have to reply to the existential questions which the citizens of Europe are raising, and the sooner the better."
"What are the geographical limits of Europe?"
"Whose vocation is it to be a member of the European Union?"
"What sort of partnership should be proposed to the countries who, although their land is not European, have a European history and strong cultural and economic links with Europe, such as Turkey or Russia?"
"Regarding Turkey, the ambiguity of the proposed solutions has led to a rupture which it must be hoped is only a temporary one, for if not this would be tragic."
"What will happen to our future relations with Russia, if the European Union opens up its borders to the east without first defining a global political architecture of the great Europe which encompasses Russia?"
"What political content do we wish to give to an enlarged European Union in the area of defence policy, security and the project of a shared society?"
"If the accession negotiations are limited to searching only for the conditions by which the ""acquis communautaire' can be extended to future Member States and put into practice by them - and this risk exists - will we not be losing sight of the most important thing, which is to set up a European political grouping capable of taking up the challenge of globalization and of avoiding cultural levelling, which would destroy the values of our civilization?"
"What unity in the area of internal and external security, or of growth shared equitably do we want to establish between Europeans in order to obtain their membership of a common project?"
"You cannot lead people towards their destiny blindfold."
"So these questions must be answered as quickly as possible for our European citizens, and the Amsterdam and Luxembourg summits have left them unanswered so far."
"Of course, the work continues and it is not all bad, but it is still a step in the dark and future presidencies of the European Union will have their work cut out."
"I wish them lots of luck!"
"Mr President, as the second half of 1997 comes to an end, one might be tempted to think that the maintenance of statutory equality within the European Union prevails over all other considerations. Mr Juncker will understand what I mean, I am sure."
"Indeed, the quality of a European Council does not vary according to the number of nationals of a Member State who take on the position of President-in-Office of the Council, nor does it vary according to the number of questions of detail that are settled."
"What is primarily important is its capacity to formulate true political directions."
"The European Council of 20 and 21 November last, which marked the starting point of a coordinated policy on the part of Member States with regard to the fight against unemployment, responded to that expectation."
"Still more recently, the Council of 12 and 13 December marked the official kick-off of a long process of reconciliation within Europe itself."
"The path to enlargement is now mapped out."
"Of course, important questions remain unanswered, in particular those relating to the financing of Agenda 2000."
"But let us not be under any illusions."
"For the foreseeable future, there will not be, or there will no longer be, cause to resort to easy solutions, either in the area of policy or in the area of financing current European Union policies or those directly related to enlargement."
"This in no way undermines the historic nature of the European Council's decision to encompass ten countries of central Europe and Cyprus."
"The most important thing in this decision is also, to a certain extent, and to use a well known phrase, the issue of what will remain when everything else has been forgotten."
"This means the number of essential points of reference on which the step towards a stronger and larger Europe must be based: I am thinking of human rights, respect for minorities, of a state of law worthy of that name."
"These have become obvious in our Member States and have been rediscovered by the applicant states of eastern and central Europe."
"The reference points or political criteria I am referring to are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Our Member States have signed it."
"So have the applicant countries."
"The same applies to the Turkish Government, which signed the convention long before the CEECs."
"We are therefore not asking the impossible of Turkey when we remind the Turkish Government to respect the principles they themselves have signed up to, the texts they themselves have signed and ratified."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Minister of Foreign Affairs, your presidency, which will soon come to an end, and for which I once again unreservedly congratulate you both personally and on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, will have enabled decisive progress to be made in essential areas."
"Essential institutional reform, the defining of budgetary parameters, the laborious modifications both within the European Union and the applicant countries all indicate that the road is still a long one in order to achieve a European Union based on values which are ever more closely knit, ever more closely united; in short, this new order of peace, justice, liberty, law and prosperity that we want with all our hearts."
"The credit for having made a good start unquestionably goes to you."
"Mr President, Presidents of the Council and the Commission, I too congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on its excellent work."
"We have seen how a country which is small in demographic terms can become great in political terms."
"And with that philosophy, our medium-sized group wishes to make some important comments, which are critical, but stem from our huge commitment to the building of Europe."
"First, I want to consider the employment summit."
"We think it is a positive step that for the first time, at the request of the French Government, there has been a summit on employment, which is the biggest problem faced by European society and the societies of our individual countries."
"It is true that employment policy is still a matter for the Member States. However, the Member States have now solemnly and publicly committed themselves to solving the problem of unemployment and providing vocational training for the long term and young unemployed, within specified timescales."
"I am also going to mention the obvious negative aspects: the fact that we continue to bow to the ideas contained in the stability pact, and the fact that there is no control over the autonomous power of the European central bank (although we must admit that the creation of the Euro Council shows a willingness to have a political government overseeing the European economy)."
"We are not making the most of the synergy between the French and Italian proposals to reduce the working day to 35 hours, although we had the chance to extend this debate to the whole of Europe."
"As for the European Council of 12 and 13 December, we basically agree with the great objective of enlargement, but there are still two major problems outstanding."
"The first is that the necessary institutional reforms have not been carried out, and we run the risk of converting Europe into a huge free trade zone."
"Therefore, we give our most wholehearted support to the idea that this institutional reform should take place before a single new member joins the European Union."
"Furthermore, in many countries there is a belief that the cost of enlargement will be paid by the less well-off Member States, with solidarity policies being reduced, and the common agricultural policy weakened."
"We need to increase the financial perspectives."
"We are also opposed to any discrimination in accepting new members. For that reason, we think it is a good idea to offer them all a range of possibilities."
"We think the European Union is taking a clear stance on Turkey for the first time."
"This is not a club for Christians."
"Turkey is a real candidate, but it has to fulfil the conditions."
"I do not want to repeat here the votes and circumstances of the customs union, but I do want to mention a very important related problem, because there have been declarations made by European institutions about the Republic of Cyprus, which I believe were inappropriate."
"We cannot renounce our acceptance of a single, legitimate government for Cyprus because of Turkey's view, or its threats."
"The people of Cyprus need to know that although there are two communities which have to work together, there is a single legitimate government."
"Lastly, I want to say that we very much approve of the Council's declaration on the peace process in the Middle East."
"We bid farewell to the Luxembourg Presidency with affection and gratitude. We also want to thank President Santer, who has been working steadily, together with the Commission, supporting the work of the various Council presidencies."
"We often criticize him, but it is important also to support and encourage him in his tasks - if we do not want to neglect the Commission."
"Mr President, Presidents of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the final approach to the end of 1997; the festive sounds and colours are even making an appearance in Parliament."
"The theme of the discussions in the European political institutions during the past year was Agenda 2000, the pressing question being how the gulf which divided Europe into two blocks after World War II might be bridged in a concrete manner, and how the old continent could once again become one Europe."
"The decisions of the Council on 12 and 13 December show that, although 12 countries were called, few were chosen, namely five plus one."
"The Greens regret that the Council opted for a two-tier model on the main issue."
"The choice made by the majority of this Parliament a few weeks ago was a different one."
"I do not think it we need to hide that; it does not help the countries concerned and it does not help our credibility."
"The choice we made in this Parliament was to start both the accession and negotiation procedures with all countries which meet all the Copenhagen criteria."
"What has remained of that is a group photo with eleven candidates taken on the 30 March."
"The true, realistic, bilateral negotiations have started with five plus one, and the other countries will be crammed to prepare for negotiations much, much later on."
"To them it is therefore only a formal accession procedure, not a negotiation procedure."
"Those who were able to pick up the reactions from the numerous Eastern European journalists immediately sensed the enormous disappointment of those kept waiting, and the enormous joy for those admitted to immediate negotiations."
"What's more, it sticks out like a sore thumb that Slovakia, despite its serious political problems, is getting exactly the same treatment as the other four countries."
"This Parliament did want to support Slovakia with a clear accession offer, but did not want to start negotiations."
"As a result of the effectual cancellation of the start of the negotiations with the other four, Slovakia now enjoys exactly the same conditions."
"This in contrast to Turkey, which is receiving incomparably different treatment."
"Already a few weeks ago, the European Parliament stated quite rightly that Amsterdam was insufficient to implement the fundamental institutional reforms."
"On that point the Council remains extremely ambiguous."
"But here, ladies and gentlemen, we have a key in our hands; no country can join without our agreement."
"That is why I would like to call on this Parliament to draw up a parliamentary strategy with the parliaments of the Member States and those of the candidate countries, that will lead to a reform of the Union which will make it enlargeable; and which will start a process that bridges the social and cultural gap between western and eastern Europe and develop authentic partnerships with all candidate countries, irrespective of their different ethnic and religious traditions."
"That way we will be able to support democratic and humanitarian strengths in all candidate countries, and that is our mission."
"Mr President, like many of the speakers before, I would like to congratulate the Presidentin-Office of the Council and the Prime Minister for the efforts deployed by their Presidency."
"They have confirmed that a country which is not one of the largest can clearly demonstrate an extraordinary amount of energy in comparison to the size of its population."
"But it is now a matter of evaluating the European Councils, that is, the decisions taken by the fifteen Heads of State and of Government."
"The balance sheet seems rather uneven to us."
"Above all, I will talk about the second summit, that of 12 and 13 December, since we have already debated the very important employment summit."
"December's summit clearly has positive aspects."
"I am thinking primarily of the confirmation of the desire of the Union to see the accession, in the near future, of the ten applicant countries of eastern and central Europe, plus Cyprus."
"It is a very important point and I understand the emotion the President of the Commission mentioned."
"In addition, Mr President-in-Office, you have managed to put all of the applicant countries of central Europe in the same family photo, thus trying your best to reduce the establishment of the two distinct categories desired by the Commission."
"I congratulate you on this."
"I am happy to note that the negotiations will be speeded up for all the applicant countries as long as they achieve sufficient progress."
"In addition, you promise to strengthen substantially the aid which will enable them to accomplish this progress."
"Let us take note of these promises."
"I also consider the confirmation of measures for the establishment of the euro and the recognition that euro zone ministers can meet together amongst the positive points of this summit."
"In this regard I am very happy with the stress which has been placed on the necessary coordination of economic policies."
"The fact remains that many points, if not negative, are at least imprecise or vague."
"That applies to the enlargement."
"I will make four comments."
"The reduction in the distinction between the two categories of applicant countries does not mean that this distinction no longer exists."
"We will have to remain vigilant to avoid the negotiations ending up in a strengthening of the divisions, even a rivalry between applicant countries."
"I would also like to express grave concerns regarding the necessary reform of the Union institutions, prior to enlargement."
"The European Council spoke of this, but with no precise commitment and without showing a clear and distinct political will."
"In this, too, we will have to be vigilant."
"There is the same imprecision and the same timidity regarding the future financial framework."
"The European Council remained vague on this and it is still not clear how we can realistically provide aid to the countries of eastern and central Europe, at the same time as aiding our own disadvantaged regions, preserving our common policies and promoting the creation of jobs."
"From this point of view, the European Council has, in a way, rushed headlong into this."
"I am not satisfied about Turkey."
"In spite of what has been said this morning in this Chamber and to which I have listened attentively, I do not believe that the Union has a clear strategy towards Turkey."
"This lack of strategy is not new, I admit. It dates back to the 1960s."
"But was it really appropriate to devote such long paragraphs to this country in the final document of the Luxembourg summit?"
"Paragraphs much longer and stricter than for any of the other applicant countries, running the risk of causing an explosion of national pride in Turkey and, even more serious, the risk of appearing ahead of ourselves with ulterior motives."
"It is through impartiality, objectivity and frankness that solutions will be found to this extremely complex issue, avoiding the regrettable blunders committed here and there."
"I am thinking, for example, of the references to religion when tracing the borders of Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have done a good job, and you are not responsible for the hesitations of the fourteen other governments."
"Unquestionably, you leave the Union in a better state than it was six months ago."
"The morale of the troops, if you will permit me this rather trivial expression, the morale of the troops has improved."
"But you know as well as I that the Union is progressing slowly."
"On numerous issues we are still at the stage of intentions."
"A great deal of effort is still required to turn these into achievements."
"Mr President, the establishment of the process of access to the European Union of the countries of eastern and central Europe has been presented by the President of the Commission in Brussels as a wonderful present to ourselves, to the applicants and to the whole world."
"This propaganda is in contrast to the reality."
"With regard to the European Union, it is clear that the process fundamentally challenges the common agricultural policy of the Treaty of Rome, which will be replaced by a free trade area favouring productivity to the detriment of employment and the environment."
"Thus the long term objective of the Commission will have been achieved, which consists of aligning European prices in the agricultural sector with world prices and of allocating the financial resources still available to a number of sectoral aids, as they exist or have existed, for textiles and shipbuilding."
"Without doubling or tripling the European budget, that is, increasing taxes considerably, the benefits of the structural funds will have but a limited effect on the economic development of the countries applying for accession, which are at a pre-capitalist stage and must first of all reconstitute a national economy before being able to face up to outside competition."
"Furthermore, is it really in the interests of these countries, having just recovered their freedom, to see their independence disappear into a European grouping which regulates all areas of political and civic life and, with a few percent of the vote, be unable to defend their own interests?"
"For France, it goes without saying that this Europe's decisions are not permanent ones."
"Our battle is only just beginning."
"Perhaps, indeed, the creation of the single currency will bring about the appearance of objective conditions which will enable the revolutionary forces of the left and right to take power."
"So all the supranational Europe activists will regret having forgotten that what is not based on the confidence of the people is illegitimate and condemned by history to disappear."
"Mr President, the conclusions reached by the Presidency of the Luxembourg summit begin by stating that the European Council of 12 and 13 December constitutes a milestone for the future of the Union and the whole of Europe and that the commencement of the process of enlargement inaugurates a new era, ending the divisions of the past. We very much hope so, even if we do not share the emphasis placed on ""new' ;"
"Mr de la Palisse would call it new - there is no doubt about it, everything that comes later is new. However, we are concerned about what the new leaves behind: a divided, weak, threatened Europe, torn to pieces by ideological or racial hatred, a poor or destroyed Europe?"
"No, Mr President; the Europe of today, not divided, not threatened and weak, not torn to pieces by racial hatred, not destroyed and hurt by poverty, is a collection of states of peoples which have freely chosen to live together and which, by the method of integration, have managed to overcome the hurdles of the past and become an economic and commercial power, a guarantee of stability and peace."
"It is the integration process that has enabled us to reach levels of wellbeing never before reached for such a large number of citizens."
"It is the integration process that has enabled countries, torn by three wars in the space of a few decades, to build a peaceful and prosperous Community together. Integration, not mere intergovernmental cooperation; common policies, not mere commercial agreements in specific production sectors; integration, not a declaration of good will; integration, regulations, common laws."
"This term has been the reason for success and it is because of the instrumental use of this term in the Presidency's conclusions that we should not agree with what has been said; that the extension of the European integration model on a continental scale is a guarantee of stability and prosperity for the future."
"No, Mr President, the European integration model after Maastricht and, above all, after Amsterdam, has become a Community acquisition; we are leaving behind the Community method of integration to adopt the intergovernmental method, the new method very dear to those who have obstructed the construction of the European Communities right from the outset or those who have disputed them or been afraid of their commencement and successes."
"My party supported the efforts made by the founding fathers and voted for the Treaties of Rome."
"It voted critically on Maastricht because it feared the risk that the single currency would become the master of any choice, excluding policy and the functions of mediation and synthesis."
"For this reason, we do not share the emphasis on this new era, on this future that will no longer be Community but intergovernmental, at the mercy of the changeable government majorities, of this or that country, whose parties in power today, in almost all countries of the Union, voted against the Treaties of Rome or, in the best case, abstained."
"However, if the new era means a Europe expanded to 21 and then to 27, the change will certainly refer to the geographical aspects, not to the quality of the Union or to its depth."
"Because that is what this is all about: without depth, without political union, enlargement will remain a territorial and statistical extension."
"We do not mean to blame the Luxembourg Government, but there is no doubt that, apart from the decision on enlargement, in the perspective we have indicated, all the other important unresolved problems studding the Union's activity, have been forgotten or put on the agenda but not dealt with. We are thinking of unemployment, justice, majority decision-making - the symbol of greater democracy within the Union, the question of the European Parliament taking part in the European Conference on enlargement - full recognition of representation of the wishes of the electorate."
"Mr President, once again Parliament has been excluded from the decisions and the future of Europe, and this is unfair and undemocratic."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Luxembourg Presidency on its stewardship over the past six months."
"The presidency has been a model of openness and good practice and I particularly welcome the way in which it has anticipated some of the democratic provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, in particular with regard to its relationship with the European Parliament and the justice and home affairs pillar."
"For many of us one of the high points of the presidency was the special employment summit, a positive summit by any yardstick and one which saw agreement on a wide range of measures and principles."
"It was a summit which stressed the need for competitiveness, training, lifelong learning, greater employability, for using the European Investment Bank to the best possible effect, for giving better support for our small and medium-sized enterprises and for greater macro-economic coordination amongst our Member States."
"All of these were positive measures."
"But if the employment summit was a success, last weekend's summit was a truly historic event."
"We are delighted that a satisfactory and sensible agreement has been reached on the so-called Euro-X."
"Informal discussions will, of course, take place amongst those Member States who join economic and monetary union in the first wave."
"But Ecofin is the body which is empowered to make economic decisions and I am glad that has been recognized."
"The Luxembourg summit was also a success because clear agreement was reached on the process of enlarging the European Union."
"A European conference will be convened for all the aspiring countries and formal negotiations will begin in the spring of next year with Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus."
"This is surely the way forward."
"As we all know, there has been some controversy over the past few days because of Turkey's reaction to the summit's decision."
"I have to say that Turkey's reaction is very unfortunate."
"The door has not been closed to Turkey - in fact, quite the opposite."
"A clear strategy has been mapped out for Turkey to move progressively closer to the European Union."
"I sincerely hope Ankara will consider its response."
"As we all know, for enlargement to be successful, the European Union too has to change and we have to have policies in place to meet the new challenges of the years ahead."
"That is why Agenda 2000 is central to all our futures."
"We should therefore be pleased that the European Council saw the Commission's communication as a firm basis for agreement on a new financial perspective, and also as a basis for going forward on a wide range of policies."
"In particular, we all recognize that the structural funds have to change in the near future and that the common agricultural policy must be reformed in a quite fundamental way."
"The Luxembourg presidency has been an undoubted success."
"Next we have the British presidency, and I believe that many of the initiatives which have been taken during the past six months will be taken forward by the British presidency."
"They will be taken forward, extended and reinforced."
"Because of what has happened over the last six months - the hard work, the conscientiousness, the diligence of the Luxembourg presidency - Europe is now more confident."
"It is now more coherent and much stronger as a result."
"The President-in-Office has done a fine job and his example must be taken forward and replicated."
"I congratulate him in the warmest possible way."
"I have received seven motions for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 37, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, Presidents, allow me first of all to thank the many colleagues who have praised the Luxembourg Presidency."
"It is true that, as in the past, Luxembourg has demonstrated that small countries can achieve great presidencies."
"This is no accident, but is explained by the fact that small nations, not having their own interests to defend, can commit themselves fully to the common good and thus work for the progress of Europe."
"What are the salient features of these last six months?"
"In my opinion, the Luxembourg Presidency has achieved a double challenge: taking fundamental, even historic, decisions, and proposing a method by which these decisions may be achieved in a balanced and timely way."
"After decades during which European action was above all dominated by economic interests, the social side has finally gained its rightful place, through the employment summit."
"In the future, economic decisions will have their social consequences; in the future, man, the citizen, will be once more the centre of European policy; in the future, thanks to the methods organized in Luxembourg, political decisions taken, both at European and national level, will play an important role."
"In the area of social issues, after Luxembourg, nothing will be the same again, and this is just as well."
"The second historic decision concerns the launching of the process of enlargement which finally puts an end to the divisions of the past and reconciles the European continent with itself."
"The way to achieve this has been decided."
"Now it is for the applicant countries to prepare themselves economically for accession and for the member countries to review their institutions and policies, in order to be able to cope with the arrival of the new members."
"This will often be difficult, sometimes painful, but the issue is worth it."
"For the process to succeed, it is of course necessary to establish a real Marshall Plan for those countries which, for decades, suffered the oppression of communism. Neither must public opinion be neglected, as the people, too, must be prepared for enlargement."
"If the Luxembourg Presidency has been a success, it is due, of course, to the excellent work of Jean-Claude Juncker and his team of ministers, but also to the hundreds of people who have been mobilised during these long months so that their little country could serve the great Europe."
"To each and every one, a big thank you."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 12 and 13 December certainly constituted a milestone for the future of the European Union and the whole of Europe."
"With the decision to expand to the East, the Twentieth Century is ending with a chapter of history that, only ten years ago, when the division of Europe and its people still remained a sad reality, no-one could imagine."
"We are pleased that the political wish of our Parliament not to exclude any applicant country has been accepted and we are also encouraged by the establishment of the European Conference and a negotiation procedure for accession which lays down a strategy reinforced by pre-accession, with partnerships and assistance during the preaccession period, providing a differentiated approach without excluding any applicant country."
"This is important because if the European Union, given its existing responsibilities, also wishes to be a politically responsible Union, it has the duty to provide assistance as a priority to the democracies ruling on shaky ground and looking to us for assistance and encouragement."
"In this context, I hope that the problem of the accession of the Turkish Republic is dealt with, both by the European Union and by the national diplomacies, with the necessary care and sensitivity."
"Although we all see the enlargement as an historic development and a political event of extreme importance, I wonder how it has been possible for the European Parliament, through its highest representative, to be excluded, and the only one excluded, from the annual Conference."
"The process of enlargement, in fact, is a process of integration of peoples."
"This House, which answers directly to the citizens for its actions, has the duty and the right to take an active part in that process."
"With regard to the decisions taken on monetary union, we are pleased with the progress so far made, which ensures a closer coordination of the economic policies in the third stage of monetary union."
"Coordination should enable the consistency of national economic policies to be checked; in the Luxembourg conclusions, we read that not only the risky budget situations but also the other developments which, if they remained, would risk calling into question the stability, competitiveness and future of the creation of jobs should be duly indicated."
"The fact is, Madam President, that some countries have already far exceeded these situations with very risky budgetary policies, which will create a particularly serious situation for monetary union."
"Madam President, we keenly hope that all the countries applying to join monetary union can do so and we are in no doubt that this can take place, but we are most concerned that certain economic and budgetary policies of certain countries are not being properly criticized."
"Madam President, I will confine myself to the issue of enlargement."
"We are assessing the historic turning point represented by the prospect of a Union uniting the countries of eastern and western Europe."
"Many of the citizens of our countries, like those of the applicant countries, hope this will mean the start of the lasting establishment of stable and peaceful relations, relations of mutual development, on this continent."
"This is the great project for the coming century."
"All steps which can be taken immediately in this direction are welcome in our eyes and will have our support."
"From this point of view, where are we after the last European Council of Luxembourg?"
"I will mention two strong criticisms and one potentially positive point."
"The first criticism concerns the way in which the negotiations anticipated in the spring of next year are being undertaken, because it runs the risk of creating serious competition between populations and countries: competition between applicant countries, due to the different treatment being given to them - digging such gulfs goes against the declared ambition of unifying the continent; and competition between Member States and future Member States, due to the threats posed by the Union, under the pretext of enlargement, to the current beneficiaries of the CAP and the structural funds."
"Competition, lastly, within the fifteen members themselves, with the demand of a state like the Federal Republic of Germany to focus a part of its current contribution to the Union budget on other countries in the future."
"The other serious criticism regarding the type of negotiations announced is the fact that they are about a relationship of subordination."
"The Commission is imposing draconian constraints of an ultra liberal inspiration on applicant countries with no regard for the achievements, the identity, the specific choices of each people concerned."
"This is not the way to treat sovereign partners whom we are proposing should join us."
"All this goes back to the heavy logic currently at work in the Union, which to my mind is calling for a deep reorientation of European construction."
"In this context, the decision to organize a European Conference between the fifteen members and all the applicant countries seems to be a sort of corrective, albeit partial, which opens up interesting possibilities."
"However, this is on condition that its jurisdiction is enlarged to economic and social questions and that it is opened up in one way or another to national and European parliaments as well as to representatives of civil society."
"In any case, a great building site has been initiated, and we will be there with one sole objective: to succeed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen from Luxembourg, the Luxembourg summit demanded honesty, credibility and responsible politics."
"The dealings with Turkey were governed by ambiguity and deviousness, one-sidedness and exclusion."
"Enlargement raises the question of how an active democratization process can be encouraged through the framework of the European Union."
"Such a dynamic would be a service to the people in Turkey who fight for democracy, human rights and the political solution of the Kurdish question."
"But the result of Luxembourg is a disservice, not a service, and will encourage precisely those forces in Turkey which are anti-European, anti-democratic and fundamentalist."
"After Luxembourg, Turkey is faced with the fact that there is no prospect of accession."
"That should have been said clearly."
"Everything else is diplomatic eyewash."
"And this is the way history goes on, the history of broken promises and treaties."
"Since 1963, it has always been the European Union which has broken parts of the Ankara Agreement."
"Turkey has been waiting for 34 years."
"In Luxembourg, it was shunted into a siding."
"Mr Juncker says that he will not sit down to negotiate with torturers."
"That is a laudably consistent attitude for an EU President."
"Consistent?"
"Then for God's sake why do not you immediately block the customs union with Turkey, which the Council and Commission forced through come hell or high water?"
"Why is NATO membership not suspended?"
"Why do EU Member States, above all the Federal Republic of Germany, supply weapons to Turkey?"
"Why are refugees sent back to Turkey, if torture is going on there?"
"The fact is that the true interest in Turkey is a geostrategic, political and above all economic self-interest."
"The question of human rights is forgotten until it suits the European Union politically."
"The role of Turkey is that of auxiliary policeman and aircraft-carrier, and Mr Clinton's raised index finger means nothing else."
"I would really like to ask you, Mr Juncker, to explain to me the difference between Slovakia and Turkey as far as democracy and human rights are concerned."
"What is the difference?"
"Is not the true background to the exclusion of Turkey the question of the identity the European Union claims?"
"The issue of the Christian Occident versus the Islamic orient; religion as the new element which builds entirely new walls."
"Is that not in turn the background for an almost paranoid, racist idea of 60 million Turks sitting on packed suitcases."
"Above all, the implications of Luxembourg affect 3 million people of Turkish origin among us, and in the Year against Racism they must be feeling like third-class people."
"That is a wrong and irresponsible signal."
"In spite of all that, Madam President, and not just because of Christmas, thanks for a very committed and very unpretentious Council presidency!"
"Madam President, I followed the Luxembourg employment summit with great interest and it was only one week before the summit that I heard Jean-Claude Juncker declare that it was necessary to reduce fiscal costs on labour and increase taxes on energy and emissions."
"Consequently, if it wants to create jobs, the European Union must put in place an ecological tax reform including, in particular, taxation of emissions and of energy consumption."
"It is an idea which has been close to my heart since the beginning of my career and I am glad that it is now becoming a majority view."
"I dare to hope that the action plans which the Member States are going to submit will take this need into consideration."
"I have myself worked within presidency teams, in particular when negotiating the agreement on fighting desertification - the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests - in New York."
"Colleagues from other countries' delegations regularly thanked us for our efficiency and our work."
"The people of Luxembourg have thus demonstrated that a small country is perfectly capable of handling the important tasks which fall to the Presidency of the Union."
"I am particularly glad that the criticisms regarding the size of our country, heard at the time of the election of our dear friend Jacques Santer to the Presidency of the Commission, have been stifled."
"I will conclude by congratulating the Luxembourg government for the efficiency of its work and by saying simply: ""Small is beautiful' ."
"Madam President, it is slippery outside today, and I fell over and hit my head and so it may be a bit difficult to hear what I have to say."
"Things are also slippery for eastern and central Europe on the way to the European Union."
"How can we make sure that these countries will not fall over?"
"We can do that by opening our market here and now to all their viable products so they notice the competition in our market instead of those companies failing on their home markets when we arrive."
"We can go through the ""acquis' ."
"Can it really be correct for them to have to approve 26, 000 documents of 80, 000 pages?"
"I would suggest that we prepare ourselves by examining all the legislation and throwing out all the laws which were not confirmed by, say, three years ago."
"The Commission could then resubmit the proposals which it would like to see retained. The Council of Ministers could adopt them, most of them by qualified majority, and Parliament can always throw them out in the cases where there are conciliation procedures."
"In this way, there might be a chance that the volume of laws would be clearer and so easier for the applicant countries to accept."
"It would also be to our own advantage."
"We would then make the EU more flexible, allow some of the provisions to be voluntary instead of mandatory, allow some provisions to be decided at a lower level by decentralising and dropping the demand that Eastern and Central Europe be involved in everything."
"Should they also join EMU and Schengen in abolishing their borders?"
"In that case, we might perhaps get the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia in the year 2004."
"The summit in Luxembourg would therefore be the start of dividing Europe rather than uniting it."
"I think it is important that there should also be room for the small countries such as Luxembourg which is represented here in this chamber by the President of the Commission and the President of the Council."
"I would like to end by thanking Luxembourg for an impartial presidency, and so let us not implement institutional changes demanding more power for the larger countries, which might, for example, make it impossible to have two Luxembourgers in leading positions as is the case today."
"Mr President, I can fully understand the furious reaction of the Turks now that it appears that their country, for the time being, and I personally hope indefinitely, does not qualify for membership of the European Union."
"Europe, after all, has never had the courage to speak plainly to Turkey."
"Europe has never really expressed its concern as far as the Turkish occupation of part of Cyprus is concerned, quite the reverse, in fact."
"In particular, Europe has never gone so far as to say, or never wanted to say, that Turkey cannot qualify for membership of the European Union because it is simply not a European country."
"Culturally, Turkey is not a European country, historically and anthropologically, it is not a European country, and strictly geographically, it is not a European country."
"So all the justified reservations about human rights violations are not exactly insignificant in this context, but they are secondary."
"For the past 30 years nobody has had the courage or the will to speak plainly to Turkey, quite the reverse."
"We have lost the opportunity thereby to build the very best relations and the very best cooperation agreements with Turkey not as a candidate state, but as a neighbour to Europe."
"This ambiguous European attitude is at the crux of the problem."
"Is Europe a confederation of free European nations and cultures working together very closely, or is it no more than a free market governed by the dogma of free trade, which does not take into consideration the geographic, cultural and historical meanings of the term Europe itself."
"The fact that no one has dared to speak plainly to Turkey leads me to fear that the second possibility is the case, and at any rate has made me a eurosceptic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage in our debate, the Presidents-in-Office wish to take the floor once more in order to reply to the different speakers."
"I will therefore willingly give them more speaking time. As you know, we will be voting at 11.30 a.m. and the debate will be continued this afternoon."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Poos, you have the floor."
"Madam President, I am also speaking on behalf of the Prime Minister, the President of the European Council and on behalf of the whole Council, when I thank the representative and non-representative speakers who have so far taken the floor in this debate and who have, for the most part, been full of praise for the Luxembourg Presidency."
"They have said that the Presidency has first of all tackled the crucial problems, and, indeed, this is its primary duty."
"The most important problem we raised during the presentation of the Luxembourg programme was unemployment in Europe."
"With regard to this, we have found a method which, if it is followed effectively on the ground, will enable us to combat unemployment in Europe in a more efficient way than ever before."
"The second problem was the enlargement of Europe."
"There, too, it was necessary to find a way of commencing negotiations under the right conditions, acceptable both to the fifteen and to the applicant countries. With regard to this too, we have, after long discussions and negotiations and many contacts and trips, found an adequate formula."
"I also noted that many speakers have stated that the most difficult task still lies ahead of us, and they are quite right."
"Our own internal reforms, the reform of our institutions and the financing of an enlarged Europe are problems which have hardly been touched upon during the last few months."
"The greatest reforms are yet to come."
"Similarly, the applicant countries will have to make an enormous effort to satisfy the criteria and for each one to adopt the ""acquis communautaire' ."
"A word about Turkey before I finish, Madam President, and a word on the Middle East."
"Along with the many speakers who have mentioned Turkey, and along with President Santer, I would like to underline the fact that the European Union's offer to Turkey has been a substantial one."
"We regret the deliberately negative presentation of this offer which has been made by the Turkish media and by the Turkish government."
"But in spite of this negativity, our offer remains valid, the door remains open and the ball is in the Turkish government's court."
"We will fully maintain our offer, as stated in the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council."
"One of the curious things about your debate, Madam President, was the reaction from Mrs Roth of the Green Group, who picked up the Turkish issue again, without much discernment. It was rather surprising for me to hear criticism with regard to this from a group which I thought cared about human rights and international law."
"With regard to the Middle East, the declaration contained in the Luxembourg conclusions in a way represents a strengthened strategy on the part of the European Union with regard to the Middle East peace process."
"The Middle East has been a constant source of worry over the last six months and I am sure that it will remain one of the main political priorities of Europe during the weeks to come."
"The position formulated by the Luxembourg Council has been somewhat criticized but I think it benefits from clarity and it avoids double meanings."
"What we need are short term measures of confidence to relaunch the peace process, and long term measures based on the principles of international law, the most important of which we have stated: the principle of the exchange of land for peace."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this applause is indicative of the feeling of this House, and we will now move on to our voting time."
"The debate will continu at 3 p.m."
"Votes"
"I voted for this amendment of the regulation since it concerns the control body."
"I would like to state, however, that I am against subsidies for olive oil growing as such."
"If the subsidy were removed, this control apparatus would be unnecessary."
"Quisthoudt-Rowohl Report (A4-0395/97)"
"We support those parts of the fifth framework programme for Euratom which are aimed at developing renewable sources of energy and at supporting the phasing out of nuclear power in central and eastern Europe."
"We think the Euratom Treaty should be fundamentally changed in this direction because we are very critical of the fact that we continue to give public aid at the European level for the growth and development of the nuclear power industry."
"Research into and development of the sustainable sources of energy of the future could create jobs opportunities and should be the way in which European society prepares to enter the 21st Century.'"
"In Sweden we have recently taken the decision to create the conditions for a rapid phasing-out of our nuclear power industry."
"We regard that as a big step in the right direction, but unfortunately it is in stark contrast to the Euratom Treaty."
"Parliament's amendments improve the Commission's proposal to an extent, but since the fundamental direction remains, we are voting against the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report in the final vote."
"It is important to maintain a high level of research expertise."
"Research into energy should take place in the areas where sustainable sources of energy can be developed."
"Research into more nuclear power, such as into nuclear fission and fusion power, cannot be justified."
"Following a referendum, Sweden has decided to phase out nuclear power."
"In several EU countries nuclear power is controversial."
"I have therefore voted no to research into nuclear power and fusion energy, but yes to the four main programmes as in the final vote."
"I would like to state that I do not share the negative attitude to nuclear power of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Soltwedel-Schäfer recommendation (A4-0386/97)"
"Mr President, at the time of our first debate on the technical specifications of the future euro coins, the European Parliament ended up admitting, after a great deal of controversy, that one side of the coin would be set aside for national symbols, and voted an article along these lines."
"Curiously, the Council does not seem to want to refer to this article."
"Let us hope that this does not mean a change in position on its part and that it remains clearly understood that the future coins will have one national side."
"With regard to this, the curious situation in which we are going to find ourselves should be noted since, unlike the coins, the notes will have two European sides, identical in all countries and with no national symbol, in compliance with the position adopted by the Council of the European Monetary Institute on 3 December 1996."
"Furthermore, you may wonder why we should accept a decision from this institute as final, when there has been no democratic debate on it."
"Certainly, article 109f.3 of the treaty anticipates that the EMI will supervise the technical preparation of the future notes, but the existence or not of a national side to the notes is not a purely technical decision since it comes down to the choice of a completely uniform and thus rigid monetary union rather than a union that is sensitive to certain differences, with flexibility in case of serious crisis."
"Similarly, article 105a of the treaty authorizes the European central bank to authorize the issuing of notes, but this relates to a basic knowledge of monetary policy and not to the right to decide on the principles of the single currency."
"I last night put an oral question to the Commission on this subject."
"It replied that this choice was certainly the responsibility of the EMI and the ECB since the treaty did not apparently anticipate any other arrangement."
"This is wrong."
"Within the treaty is article 109f.4, which enables the Council to take all other necessary measures for the introduction of the single currency."
"Why is this not used?"
"Are they afraid to hear the views of the different countries on this subject?"
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for the report."
"With this explanation of vote we would like to underline our fundamental position on the question, which is due to the fact that we think the coins should be designed so that the risk of allergies is eliminated, that attention should be paid to the needs of the visually impaired and that consideration should be given to the need for a firmly established identity for the coins."
"For these reasons we think that the euro coins should be nickel-free, that the denominations should be of different sizes and that the coins should have room for national designs on one side of the coin."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the Soltwedel-Schäfer report, which deals with the technical specifications of the future euro coins."
"The rapporteur emphasized in particular that the coins should be easily recognizable."
"This is particularly important when the coins are used by the blind and old people."
"In his report, the rapporteur proposes that the diameters of individual coins should increase with their stated value."
"The Danish Social Democrats support this idea and see this proposal in particular as something which could make the coins more recognizable and so benefit the blind and elderly."
"The Danish Social Democrats supported the amendment that, in making the euro coins, alloys should be used which release very little nickel if nickel cannot be avoided completely."
"In approving the Soltwedel-Schäfer report, the Danish Social Democrats would like to point out that Denmark will not be taking part in the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"It is pleasing that the Council has accepted the design of a European and a national side to the new euro coins, which is an expression of the symbolic meaning and essential for popular acceptance."
"But it must be noted with regret that the Council has not met Parliament's demand to avoid nickel in the new euro coins altogether."
"However, I see the acceptance of the euro coins as a major step as part of the third phase of EMU, so I am voting in favour of the report, even though I am against the use of nickel in the coins."
"Sindal Report (A4-377/97)"
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough report."
"With this explanation of vote we would like to emphasize that we are sceptical towards subsidies for the shipyard industry."
"A competitive shipyard industry, which can be effective in a functioning international market cannot be kept going by subsidies."
"Despite the increased competition from further afield, shipbuilding remains an important European industry."
"Areas in the UK which have a shipbuilding tradition are very proud of their local shipyards and what they have achieved over the years."
"Harland & Wolff, for example, was virtually synonymous with the rise of Belfast as a powerful industrial city and has enjoyed the respect of Northern Ireland people for its determination to develop its business throughout the period of changing economic circumstances."
"People in cities throughout Europe have much the same attitude towards their shipyards and believe, as I believe, that the European Union should try to help them face down unfair competition as much as it possibly can."
"I support the extension of the seventh directive for as long as the United States of America refuses to honour its obligation to contribute towards a level playing field in the shipbuilding industry."
"That is what we want most for our shipbuilders - that they can operate with the minimum of state support because they are operating in a fair competitive environment."
"We must continue to put pressure on the United States to play fair."
"Within Europe, of course, we must also have a level playing field."
"Whereas I support the principle that individual Member States should determine their own employment and social policies, it should be noted that we, in the UK, continue to feel that our shipbuilding firms operate at a serious disadvantage compared to those in other parts of the Union."
"It would be easier to put pressure on the USA to contribute to fairer competition if that fair competition genuinely existed in the EU."
"Parliament has noted once again that the Untied States, and other countries with a high naval construction capacity at world level, are continuing their repeated refusal to ratify the 1994 (!) OECD Agreement, which was ostensibly intended to 'normalize' conditions for competition in the sector."
"In the circumstances, we are left with no alternative but to approve an extension of the term of the provisions contained in the Seventh Council Directive allowing national public subsidies for European naval construction to continue and remain in force until 31 December 1998."
"We are nevertheless taking the opportunity to reiterate once more that we were right when we voted against that directive in 1994, because it is being more and more clearly proved that it meant we were going ahead with legislation and limiting subsidies when others were not and still are not doing so; the directive sought to standardize and limit national subsidies from Member States, leaving the door open for aid to regional government, and thus contributed decisively to reducing the size of the industry in countries where it was of strategic importance (such as Portugal), promoting concentration on certain more developed countries, for the benefit of large private groups."
"A vote in favour of the extension under discussion today is a matter of the most elementary justice, but it must not allow us to forget the essential issues, nor the economic and social damage caused by the seventh directive."
"In view of industry and jobs in Europe, there is no doubt that the Council's seventh directive on aid to the shipbuilding industry should be prolonged until the US ratifies the treaty on normal competitive conditions within the shipbuilding and ship repair industry."
"We should compete on equal terms, so the rapporteur is absolutely right in emphasizing that this aid treaty should be dropped when or insofar as international trade treaties fall into place."
"I therefore give the report my full support."
"This help for shipbuilding has a complicated history, from which in our assessment an escape route which is truly right for the future can only be found through a concerted worldwide effort to renew the world shipping fleet to the highest standard of safety, navigation and environmental protection technology which is possible today."
"All attempts to dodge a solution of this central problem by restrictive measures or deregulation strategies will only prolong the endless loop of the world shipbuilding negotiations yet again."
"It is pointless to identify and accuse the culprit directly responsible in each case!"
"Postal services"
"I support the concern of several MEPs who spoke against negative consequences of uncontrolled liberalization of postal services during the part-session in Strasbourg."
"In an oral question, they asked the EU Commission to act against such dangerous developments."
"In various countries, the postal service demands special charges for incoming letters because the foreign stamps do not cover the distribution costs."
"In fact, the foreign postal service pays a specified percentage of the stamp charge to the distributing postal service in the destination country, to meet the costs of distribution."
"But this compensation payment is often below the cost of distribution."
"The new charges were introduced by some countries to make up for this difference."
"This method is a direct consequence of uncontrolled liberalization, because the traditional postal companies, in competition with private companies, cannot afford to take on these systematic overheads."
"These charges indicate the important difference between the absolutely free market economy and healthy competition as it is wanted in the EU."
"The EU wants to open up the internal market for postal services, but not at any price."
"Liberalization is desired, and is intended to bring advantages for consumers, as far as the range and quality of services are concerned."
"However, the prices of these services must always cover the overheads, because otherwise the door is open for wild and unrestricted competition, which will then have negative consequences for the job market."
"It remains to be hoped that the Commission has actually recognized the problem, and will very quickly take steps to put it right."
"Towards Christmas a few miracles occurred in this Parliament."
"The debate about this question for which my group also submitted a resolution has been moved from the Friday to the Monday, without anyone informing me of this."
"Nonetheless, not only did Commissioner Bangemann refer to me in the debate as having second sight, but the official press report of our services presented me as speaker, even though I was absent for valid reasons."
"What is more, I was presented as one of the signatories of the joint compromise resolution, despite the fact that I had not seen the text, let alone wanted to sign it: it contains nothing, or if you like, nonsense."
"What is it about? The Universal Postal Union - UPU - has a convention."
"This contains a provision that the terminal dues are calculated by the kilo."
"This unit of weight can comprise one item of 500 letters of 20 gram."
"It is obvious that the delivery costs can therefore vary considerably."
"In a word, this regulation is not satisfactory."
"The IPC, a club of 20 operators, including all Member States, wanted to change this situation."
"The result was Reims-I, in which it was agreed that the end costs would be calculated on the basis of delivery costs of the destination country, varying between 50-80 %, depending on the quality."
"The Bundespost did not think this was enough, and has thought up a new system with La Poste Française on the payment of 85 % without the quality criterium; in other words, sponsoring inefficiency."
"In my opinion it would have been obvious in a free internal market to give all universal service providers a free hand to arrive to at an agreement between themselves, on the basis of real costs and quality."
"As long as this is not expressly stated in the resolution, my group is not able to agree, and will therefore abstain."
"It is up to the Commission to guarantee the free market and I call on it to do so!"
"Progress in the area of justice and home affairs"
"European cooperation in the area of security seems to us absolutely essential - at least in its intergovernmental form."
"Unfortunately, up until now, it has been marked by a weakness in the democratic control exercised by national parliaments."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has often proposed filling this gap by creating an interparliamentary body to follow up the actions undertaken in the area of the third pillar."
"Thus it must be clearly noted that the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is going to be submitted to Member States for ratification, takes precisely the opposite path."
"By transferring these areas from the intergovernmental area of the treaty to the Community area, it leads national parliaments to lose virtually all the powers they previously had, without replacing them with abilities of equivalent strength and quality at the level of the European Parliament."
"In effect, the ""communitarizing' of areas relating to visas, asylum, immigration and the international circulation of people will deprive national parliaments of many powers: 1) loss of the right of decision (which will be transferred to the Council or if need be the European Parliament, under supervision of the Court of Justice); 2) loss of the right of legislative initiative (which will become the prerogative of the Commission after five years); 3) loss of the power of prevention (removal of the unanimous decision procedure of the Council, in accordance with new article 67 of the EC Treaty); 4) weakening of the powers of control, which will become indirect, etc."
"This eradication of national parliaments' powers is not compensated for by an increase in the power of the European Parliament, for two reasons."
"On the one hand, the European Parliament does not gain exactly the same legal rights as those lost by the national parliaments: in some areas the national parliaments lose decision making rights, whilst the European Parliament has conferred on it only the right to be consulted."
"On the other hand, as it is conceived, the exercise of these powers will distance the European Parliament from the concerns of its citizens, even though the areas covered by the third pillar are extremely sensitive, because they are closely linked to national sovereignty and to the security of goods and people."
"This distancing may cause fatal consequences, in particular concerning decisions taken on immigration questions, an area where the lax philosophy of the European institutions is well known."
"In reality, the Treaty of Amsterdam proposes an increase in the lack of democracy in Europe. This is why we reject it."
"Organized crime is a sophisticated international business that recognizes no borders."
"The European Union response is piecemeal, uncoordinated to a significant degree and primarily fought within national boundaries."
"Why is it that we can remove the obstacles and borders to ensure the effective functioning of the single market yet we cannot apply the same principles and practices in the war against organized crime?"
"It would be correct to say that some progress has been made in the area of justice and home affairs under the Irish, Dutch and Luxembourg presidencies."
"However it must also be acknowledged that it is lamentably slow and much more needs to be done."
"Interior ministers seem to be more interested in protecting their little empires than winning the battle against criminals."
"It is also extremely disappointing to note that only five Member States have ratified Europol which has a critical role to play in the area of cooperation across frontiers."
"This fact is symptomatic of the problem."
"Let us hope when we discuss this issue next year we will be able to report that real progress has been made."
"Billingham Report (A4-0357/97)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of services of general interest is one of the themes for discussion within the context of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"By introducing a new article, article 7, the Treaty of Amsterdam ranks this notion of general interest service amongst the common values of Europe."
"We can but congratulate them for this."
"But what a path has been trodden since this demand by the European Parliament!"
"We can quote the great areas of liberalization: electricity, gas, postal sector, air sector."
"At each stage of liberalization, the notion of market value gained the upper hand over the notion of public service."
"And the citizens of Europe could not accept this."
"Now, this notion of public service must be continued through the establishment of a charter stating its great principles."
"At the beginning of the century, the French School of Public Service was able to set out the great laws developed by Léon Duguit."
"It is now Europe's turn to take over on behalf of its 350 million inhabitants."
"It will pay dividends for European integration!"
"The Billingham report is a positive, sensible response to the Commission's Communication on services of general interest in Europe, an issue which has been neglected at the Community level for far too long."
"For Europe's goals of economic and social cohesion to become a reality, for Europe to be a citizen's Europe, the EU needs to intervene in the sphere of public services, which are fundamental to each and every European citizen."
"All European citizens rely on the provision of basic services such as electricity and water, transport and postal services."
"And only EU-wide action can solve the problems of poor cross-border postal services or over-priced airline tickets."
"But although Europe aspires to running a frontier-free market, the EU cannot regulate these transfrontier vital services."
"European citizens are therefore being shortchanged, for the rhetoric of the single market and a Europe for the people sounds empty if they cannot expect equal access to essential goods and services."
"The EU's track record on this is poor and needs to be improved."
"It needs to define, specify and regulate the services of general interest so that European citizens can be sure that they are receiving a consistent and fair service, wherever they live in the EU."
"The inclusion of the new article 7d in the Amsterdam Treaty is therefore to be welcomed."
"This recognizes the notion of services of general interest as one of the common values of Europe and as a principle of Community law."
"But positive action now needs to be taken with the establishment of a European Charter for Public Services, European Parliament scrutiny of proceedings, and special responsibility for public services to be designated to a Commissioner and Directorate-General."
"If we want the single market to work we have to have Europe's citizens on board, and we can gain this by providing good quality services and so help increase social well-being."
"It is good that the EU recognizes services of general interest and that deregulation has limits."
"The citizens must be ensured access to services of general interest, such as post, telecommunications and transport, on equal terms and at reasonable prices."
"At the same time attention must be paid to the effects on the environment, social security and employment."
"Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States should decide how and by whom services shall be carried out, define levels and quality and the way rules operate."
"We have therefore voted no to the report, since we are opposed to the proposal for EU legislation in the area."
"No such new competence is given under article 7d of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Commission defines utility services as services which are of general interest and which are provided by public authorities."
"These services are often provided on a commercial basis, so as far as the free market is concerned, as the committee is correct in pointing out, there should be a uniform set of rules for the Union as a whole."
"As the committee emphasizes, these services should mainly cover important network services, such as provision of water, electricity, gas, railways, radio, TV, telecommunications and postal services."
"It is therefore pleasing to see that the Commission and European Parliament are united on this point and it is therefore with great pleasure that I can support the committee's report."
"In connection with the debate on efficiency with regard to services of general interest, I would like to point out that economic efficiency does not take into account quality and the protection of human values."
"The number of teachers per child in school is certainly a measure of efficiency which is in fact used."
"However, at the same time (and inversely proportional to the measure of efficiency) it is a measure of the quality of teaching."
"It is inappropriate to use ideas of economic efficiency when the activity concerns core activities in public services, such as nursing, caring and education."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"European Council in Luxembourg - Six months of the Luxembourg Presidency (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council statement on the six months of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"I would like to welcome the presence among us of the President of the European Council and the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker."
"The President of the Council has given an example to us all by following the entire debate that is being held on the review of the Luxembourg Presidency. I would like to stress this and I would like this example to find imitators."
"Although it is not customary for such comments to be made from the Chair, I would like to say that I think I echo the feelings of all our colleagues when I express my appreciation for the Luxembourg Presidency, which is coming to an end in a few days' time."
"It has been an example to us in many things and I think that the Prime Minister, Mr Juncker and the Foreign Minister, Mr Poos, who had to leave, deserve the congratulations of the European Parliament for their willingness to work with us and for the excellent way in which they are bringing to an end the presidency of a small country, which demonstrates once again how successful the Luxembourg Presidencies have been and how much the presidencies of the smaller countries have helped to promote the concerns of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, a sense of modesty prevents me from crowing with nationalistic delight about the Luxembourg Presidency, but I all the same I would like to say that this Presidency has, once more, proved its know-how and commitment to Member States, when its size does not predestine it, in a traditional national perspective, to play an international role."
"It has become apparent over the months, that the Luxembourg Presidency has spared no efforts, and with success."
"Everyone has recognized that this morning."
"I would first like to return briefly to the employment summit, a poisoned present if ever there was one."
"It has been a success, considering all the reticency and unspoken words."
"This success is largely due to the enthusiasm of the presidency."
"It has in fact worked on the squaring of the circle, for it was necessary to respect national jurisdiction in the area of employment, not to increase budgetary expenditure and, however, to define precise measures and above all to commit credits which we were able to clear in the European Union budget thanks to the collaboration of the European Parliament."
"I think that the Council is finally going to agree, indeed has agreed, to give a legal basis to a truly European policy on employment."
"As far as last week's summit is concerned, it clarified the approach and methods of the European Union for the years to come."
"There too, we succeeded, in Luxembourg, in not dividing Europe, in giving the countries of Europe a true perspective of accession."
"Quite a lot has been said this morning on the problems which remain in the path to be followed."
"At the same time as finding a solution to these problems we must, I think, move reflection further on regarding the limits and future configuration of an integrated European area."
"This space cannot stretch into infinity and I therefore think that, whilst opening up new perspectives through this summit, we must also open up a new reflection on the future shape of Europe."
"Allow me to say a word more on the work of the presidency in other essential areas."
"The presidency's initiatives in the area of foreign policy were fruitful and useful in many ways."
"I would, above all, like to underline the attitude of dialogue and permanent openness of the Luxembourg Presidency with regard to the European Parliament."
"Members who participated in conciliation meetings noted this."
"This attitude marks a turning point all the more important - and I insist on this - since the reforms of the Treaty of Amsterdam regarding codecision will make interaction between the Council and Parliament frequent and necessary in order to get results."
"Finally, I would like to note that, in the path towards the euro, the European Parliament is finding its place, thanks to a good understanding with the Council, in particular during the long weekend of the 1 and 2 May."
"Furthermore, it was noted that, in the context of the third pillar, the Luxembourg Presidency has opened up a new means of collaboration with the European Parliament, in an area which is largely intergovernmental."
"Mr President, there are many individual issues on which the Luxembourg Presidency has accomplished important work and has managed to reach agreements."
"I am thinking in particular of taxation, an area in which the presidency has truly achieved a breakthrough."
"Mr President, the Luxembourg Presidency has shown that for the country who assumes the presidency, the best way of helping oneself is clearly not to focus cautiously on your own interests, but to serve others by adopting an offensive and positive attitude in the face of the European task."
"I think that this is a message which Luxembourg and European opinion should know."
"Let us not forget this historic lesson."
"I would like to thank Mr Fayot."
"What he said is very true and I admit I allowed him to run over his allotted speaking time considerably in recognition of his very consistent work in this House."
"Mr President, I hope that if I point to my work I might perhaps gain a second or two?"
"It was less than nine years ago, yet worlds away."
"On 1 August 1989, on the Austrian-Hungarian border, a first breach in what was then still the Iron Curtain was made."
"The opening of the Brandenburg Gate a few months later began the collapse of the Eastern bloc, and simultaneously resulted in the creation of free, sovereign and democratic states, which have now rightly reminded us of their position as candidates for membership of the Union."
"The Union is facing this historic challenge."
"The enlargement to the East actually promises enormous political and economic gains for us all."
"Gains in security, and as far as external security is concerned I believe that I do not have to justify that."
"We must work on the gains in internal security."
"New economic opportunities are linked to this enlargement to the east, and one would expect to find agreement and even enthusiasm in Europe."
"There is none to be found, or very little."
"They are outweighed by scepticism and fear."
"Even in Austria, my country, which is returning for the first time for many years from the periphery to the centre, many people are afraid that uncontrolled cheap labour and cheap agricultural products will rush in."
"In other parts of the Union, people are nervous about the money from the structural and cohesion funds."
"In this situation, we must ensure that we make clear to all those who are affected that there is nothing to fear."
"At least, not if we use all the opportunities of the enlargement, and not if, to the extent that it is necessary and justified, we ensure that no-one is left behind, by careful negotiation results with appropriate transition rules, and if necessary also with individual, targeted support actions."
"A final word of congratulation to the Luxembourgers."
"They have shown - as has been said several times today - that a small country can contribute a great deal to Europe."
"I hope that Austria, which will take over the presidency in autumn next year as the next of the small and medium-sized Member States, will carry out this task as well as Luxembourg has."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, like the previous speaker, I will wait until I have finished my contribution before giving my plaudits, but I acknowledge the fact that they are going to come."
"If I do nothing else in the time available to me, I want to say a very sincere word of thanks and congratulations to the Luxembourg presidency."
"Well done, we are proud of you!"
"Not just as Luxembourg, but we are proud of you as a small nation, and you are certainly showing the others who have been there before you and those who are coming immediately after you, how to do a good job."
"Your pursued the agenda that you laid before this Parliament with skill and determination, with diplomacy, and at times with strength when necessary to ensure that you achieved your objectives."
"Well done, we are proud of you, and may others learn from you."
"The summit represented a significant step forward in the ongoing evolution of the European Union."
"That is particularly so in the context of the next wave of enlargement, an event which will transform the Union significantly, ensuring that the EU of the next century will be very different in configuration from that of the 1990s and is also of great symbolic importance given that it involves many of the countries in the former eastern bloc."
"The decision to open negotiations with Poland, Estonia, the Czech republic, Hungary and Slovenia is genuinely a historic one."
"This, more than anything else, marks the end of the cold war and the bridging of the divisions that have existed in Europe for much of this century, and for this reason alone the summit gives cause for great satisfaction and is the culmination of years of work."
"Ireland has much to offer the new applicant states as a model for what can be achieved with the help of EU transfers and policies, and I personally look forward to the forging of new and deeper relations between the applicant states and Ireland, particularly in the areas of trade and tourism."
"Enlargement is also vital to the long-term development of the EU itself."
"However, this enlargement must take place in a structured fashion and at a steady pace in the interests of both the Union and the applicant countries."
"There are clear implications for the EU's decision-making process and the shape and size of the budget; and regarding the budget I am satisfied with the decision of the summit not to pre-empt the detailed negotiations that have yet to take place on the budget for the period 2000-2006."
"But I am not altogether convinced that the budget ceiling on spending as currently constituted is wholly practical."
"If we are to meet on the one hand the demands of enlargement, and the need for transitional financial arrangements for existing Member States on the other, then a greater degree of budgetary flexibility may be required."
"Thank you, President-in-Office and thanks to Luxembourg; and let us hope that everything goes well with the new presidency that is about to begin."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have all been trying to take advantage of the same favour I extended to Mr Fayot."
"I cannot really refuse you as you probably more than deserve them."
"Mr Juncker, you are right."
"The most important decision of the summit was to decide on no postponement of the euro."
"But that has consequences."
"Even intelligence, prudence and tireless commitment must be measured against the requirements which are set by the introduction of the euro."
"We need as a counterweight an effective, jointly coordinated policy against mass unemployment."
"You might say that in Essen there was a pursing of the lips. In Luxembourg there was a trial whistle."
"A first test run may be useful, but not enough to get a grip on the problem."
"The aims have too many loopholes, and you know that."
"Second: regarding the setting up of the European central bank and Euro-X, really the softest possible form has been found: informal, vague task description, unclear definition of the opt-outs."
"Third: regarding tax harmonization, to a large extent it has remained as intended."
"Even the code of conduct has as many explanations of exceptions as a Swiss cheese has holes, so considerable work remains to be done there."
"We should not fool ourselves."
"Gramsci said that optimism of the will is needed to do anything."
"But pessimism of the intellect is also needed."
"Very much remains to be done, too much."
"At least the starting line and course are sketched out, and the Luxembourg Presidency must surely be thanked for that."
"When we in Germany manage to make a political change of course, we in Europe can probably learn to go actually together in a correct - more productive and with more effect on employment - direction."
"Mr President, we have heard a lot about the future of the Union in the coming months and what Luxembourg has done to prepare it for that future."
"However, the last six months have been tragic for the people I represent."
"The farming community in Northern Ireland, which forms the basis of the economy of the country, is on the verge of total and absolute collapse."
"As Mr Hume, one of my colleagues, said recently in a speech on Northern Ireland: ' We are facing days that can only be compared to the Irish famine.'"
"This has come about because in the last six months farmers and the ancillary agro-industries of Northern Ireland have been discriminated against."
"They have beef health standards and traceability standards not matched anywhere else in Europe, and yet Europe has closed the market to their produce."
"I have to say with great regret that if in the last six months we had had far more determination from both the Commission and the Council this calamity could have been averted."
"I trust that something in the last days of the Luxembourg presidency will help to redeem this."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, I would like to join the ranks of those who have congratulated the past Presidency on its successful activity in many areas."
"In the area of employment policy, it must be measured against what happened before."
"I would like to concentrate on some points of external policy: the questions of Turkey, the Near East and - if there is still time - Yugoslavia or former Yugoslavia."
"The President of the Council made intensive efforts to come to an agreement with Turkey about how this important process of rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey can happen."
"The President of the Council found some public words which can be called undiplomatic or honest, depending on how one sees things."
"I am not so critical or sceptical about it, because I believe that we have entered a phase in which we must talk openly and honestly to Turkey."
"If there are reservations - reservations with good reasons - they should be expressed openly."
"I have spoken critically, even in this Chamber, against a decision or recommendation of Christian Democratic parties about the relationship with Turkey, because of the differences of religion."
"But as far as the differences in questions of human rights are concerned, or differences in questions of how one relates to one's neighbours and starts conflicts or not, there are serious differences which must be identified beyond the political forces in this Chamber, but at the same time the firm will to enter discussions with Turkey."
"I would like to say clearly once again, even to Turkey, that what happened in Luxembourg is not closing the door but opening it."
"But even to friends, one must be critical where critical comments are appropriate."
"What matters now is to see whether something can be achieved with specific agreements."
"As far as the Near East is concerned, you were also very active."
"I had the opportunity to be in Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria almost in the footsteps of the Council Presidency."
"I saw that very good approaches were disseminated here."
"We see that the Arab world demands much more from Europe than we can give at this time."
"Thank God, no longer against the USA, but altogether in cooperation, always as a strong - sometimes quite independent - partner, but a great deal happened here too."
"That also applies to Yugoslavia."
"I hope that we can make more progress under the British Presidency, based on your preparation. We must make it clear that we stand by Dayton, that we insist that war crimes must be punished, that there must be true peace and cooperation."
"Finally, my congratulations again on the Luxembourg Presidency."
"As has already been mentioned, Austria will likewise have the Presidency in the second half of 1998."
"We are a small country like Luxembourg."
"But one thing is exemplary, first in Luxembourg, second in Austria: low unemployment."
"I hope that the European Union will soon reach the average of the Luxembourg and Austrian unemployment levels."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under the energetic and imaginative leadership of Luxembourg, good, noteworthy progress has been achieved in the field of internal and legal policy, in many particular fields, from organized crime to delivery of documents in civil and commercial court cases."
"What matters now is to combine these individual steps into a total concept."
"We must make the European legal area co-extensive with the European economic area."
"We have become used to being able to claim the whole internal market for commerce."
"The legal instruments which protect commerce are still blocked by national internal borders."
"Now we must therefore ensure that, wherever trade throughout the Union is possible, we also provide legal protection throughout the Union."
"For this purpose we need a convincing total concept, which does not consist of transferring national legal systems to the Community, but which ensures that there are legal instruments with Community effect where Community trade is possible."
"That must be at the centre of the work in the legal and internal fields in future."
"If you will allow me a comment on the side, Mr President of the Council: If it is true that secret data from the Schengen computer has been sold to organized crime, as the Neue Zürcher Zeitung has reported, that would be an unprecedented scandal and would have to have consequences both in the security system and for the responsible individuals, and I believe that it would be altogether advisable if the President of the Council would look into it, even though the Union has not been responsible for Schengen up to now."
"Mr President, I would like to stay with the issue of enlargement and Turkey, and to stress that we have all been impressed by the Luxembourg presidency and by the personal intervention of Prime Minister Juncker in combining honesty and dignity with a political spirit of conciliation and political vision."
"The big question for me is: after the Luxembourg session comes to an end what will happen and how will our achievements be maintained?"
"I think that the first precondition for continuity is for the British Presidency to stick to the decisions of the Luxembourg session, which were not due to any veto and which have so far been the most unifying decisions that we have had with regard to Turkey."
"The second thing is that the European Union must reserve the right to draw up policies that relate to itself and not yield to the demands of the United States, which is what we saw yesterday at the political session of NATO foreign ministers, with the attempt of Mrs Albright to present a European Union which would be a Banana Republic of the United States."
"Thirdly, the European Union must resist - which is very easy to do - the ridiculous threats of Turkey, which is brandishing the 2.5 billion dollars for the purchase of aeroplanes until the year 2000, or the 3 to 4 billion dollars for the privatization of its energy industry or, even more so, the 150 billion dollars over a period of twenty years for the purchase of weapons."
"I think that the European Union must maintain a cool-headed, unequivocal and unshakeable position, especially when it is faced with provocative actions such as those of Minister Tselembi when he says that they will boycott European businesses, with the exception however of the United Kingdom, which will hold the presidency, France and Italy."
"With these preconditions and with progress in the Cyprus issue, I think that Turkey sooner or later will take advantage of this opening of the door offered to her by the European Union by taking of course the necessary steps to solve the Cyprus problem, through respect of international law and human rights and through the peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem."
"Mr President, as ever when judging the results of the Commission it is a case of pluses and minuses."
"I think the result is best summarised by a colleague of mine who said: it is less than we hope for, but more than we expected."
"That rather expresses my feeling."
"I find the fact that the mechanism which also leads to the coordination or the disciplining, if you like, of the EMU, now also includes employment very positive."
"I have a strong impression that a very large number of representatives of Member States do not quite understand what this means and must mean in the future."
"There are some positive issues, but it will not surprise the Prime Minister that I in any case am disappointed about what has happened in the sphere of taxes."
"I do not reproach him for this."
"I know there is resistance, but to shift taxation either to investigations on national level - while we know that, in a kind of prisoner's dilemma, we do not dare move because a competing colleague Member State will carry off the prize - or by passing the mandate on to Ecofin, where ultimately there must be unanimity in decision-making, does not exactly fill me with enthusiasm for the future, especially as I know that if there was one negative factor in the preparations of the summit, it was Ecofin."
"I will return to this topic."
"The most important issue seems to me the much welcomed presidency and the result they have delivered in looking forwards to the follow up."
"What does this mean for the future?"
"In my opinion, extremely important new opportunities have been created for the coming years, but then we must, and I mean at the level of the Council, the Commission and this Parliament, sink our teeth into this hard-won result."
"Because though we might see the result as a step forward, there are government leaders who left the summit, went back their own country and said: we can simply carry on as before."
"Look, if this is the attitude amongst representatives of the Member States, then there is still an awful lot to do."
"I think we have to be exceptionally alert and active in this."
"I am obviously disappointed that social VAT, as I will call it for convenience sake, was not accepted."
"Not because it is a pet issue in the Netherlands, but because I actually think it is ridiculous that Member States do not allow other Member States to start experiments in this field."
"I really do not understand what it is in the Council that it makes it want to block this possibility."
"I would like to ask the Prime Minister if I may interpret the text to mean that the Netherlands is allowed to see where the ground lies, in other words is be able to start the experiments."
"The subject of economic coordination strikes me as equally important for the future."
"Will the balance which was incorporated in the employment chapter, in the results of Luxembourg, also be put into practice?"
"I can see people thinking this is coordination, this balance has to be introduced via Ecofin."
"It think that is simply ridiculous."
"Up till now this has not been the obvious institution to accomplish a balance with employment."
"I am also concerned for the sake of the future presidency, because the many contacts that I have had I notice that an enormous amount of missionary work has to be done, that there is an impression that Ecofin is better suited to coordination."
"I would find that incredibly unfortunate, and absolutely not in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Briefly and to the point, the Luxembourg summit was a start, a very important start."
"The results are extremely important."
"But it was a merely a start."
"A great deal of undercoating still needs to be applied, a great deal needs to be done finally to wrap the term flexibility in genuine certainty."
"A great deal needs to be done in the field of taxation, etc."
"But I would like to conclude with expressing my appreciation just once more - it risks becoming boring - towards the presidency, because I am convinced that if it had not been launched so toughly and firmly by Jean-Claude Juncker, we would have been discussing a very different result."
"As far as that is concerned, my thanks."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 21 November 1997 is a noteworthy date."
"The Heads of State and of Government finally made up their minds to avoid big words at a summit, and agreed on concrete decisions."
"Subsidiarity was ensured."
"President of the Council Juncker said rightly that we all have the same disease, but do not necessarily need the same medicine."
"In Luxembourg, the content of the approaches to the common employment strategy on which the Essen summit decided was filled in."
"The main concern of the citizens of Europe is now also the main subject of those who are responsible for government, that is the fight against unemployment."
"The most important findings from our debates in the European Parliament with a highly committed President of the Council were put into effect."
"Retraining and further education, training and jobs will be made possible for young people under 25 within six months, and for the long-term unemployed within one year."
"Small and medium-sized companies are actively supported by the European Investment Bank."
"Budget resources are restructured, and our Parliament played a leading role in this."
"Luxembourg is also a rejection of the Utopians who thought that additional programmes at European level and costing billions could solve the problem."
"Anyone who says that this can be financed is fooling the citizens."
"It is also a slap in the face for those in Germany who claimed in advertisements that the German Federal Chancellor would block it."
"On the contrary, here one of them has used his great influence to achieve unanimity for results which can be put into effect."
"Our colleague Mr Wolf will therefore also be wrong with his hope for a change of government in our country."
"Mr Wolf has often been mistaken, but not usually the German Federal Chancellor!"
"Back to Luxembourg."
"Jean-Claude Juncker made it clear that 2 + 2 = 5."
"The reason is that there is a European added value, through coordination, model projects and ever more intensive exchange of experience."
"The future annual balance sheet of the national campaigns based on European guidelines has every chance of becoming a success in relation to group dynamics."
"The employment summit shows that the European medal has not just one side, the economic, but equally the other side, the social."
"Congratulations, Jean-Claude Juncker!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, even the fact that a snail's pace continues to be declared in European integration changes nothing of the positive image of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Because, as a German author says, progress is a snail, but it moves, and it moves forward. It can therefore be said that in the field of tax cooperation, in the field of employment policy, there have really been the first steps towards letting citizens feel that they are better understood in what goes on here at the European decision level."
"I think that in this Luxembourg Presidency it has become very clear that taking responsibility and leadership quality are just what a presidency needs."
"That should also be emphasized in relation to economic and monetary union."
"It is certainly right to emphasize, again and again, the date of the start of monetary union, 1 January 1999."
"But at the same time the house tasks must be done."
"Here I would like to say to the Council Presidency that this European Parliament has certainly always done the house tasks very quickly."
"But it would be good if all Heads of State and of Government, and above all EU finance ministers, would use clear language about political responsibility in their testimonies, promises and messages."
"Here I regret very much that the Luxembourg Presidency could not finish with two further positive results."
"I mean here a positive decision about the presidency of the European central bank."
"I think that the way in which the staffing discussion has been conducted is not good for the future credibility of the independence of the European central bank, and I hope that before the end of the year a solution may still be given in this area, so to speak as a Christmas present for monetary peace."
"But I also think that it would be important, precisely in the field of monetary union, not just to find temporary solutions for the Euro-X Council, but also to make a clear statement of who has what responsibility for macro-economic interrelated decisions."
"Here we can give not only the European finance ministers, the national central banks and the European central bank responsibility, but I would also emphasize very clearly from Parliament's point of view that there must be a triad between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, as far as responsibility for both economic and employment policy guidelines is concerned."
"We really need concentration here."
"We do not need different orientations, so that the Member States, which obviously remain responsible here for economic and employment policy, create added value, and anyway no coordination."
"I therefore insist that the demand of this European Parliament for inter-institutional agreements in relation to the development of economic policy guidelines for the European Union and its Member States remains a current demand even for the next Council presidency."
"Mr President of the Council, if you could contribute, even after the end of the Council presidency, to ensuring that the Economic and Finance Committee of the European Union does not argue only from monetary and financial points of view, but by its composition can also consider the economic policy arguments, that would certainly be an improvement which would be valued positively."
"Mr President, may I begin by congratulating the Luxembourg presidency on their efficiency and effectiveness."
"I only wish the European Parliament could show some of the same qualities."
"That way we could organize this debate as a coherent whole instead of in little bits."
"This morning Mr Poos gave an extensive report on the activities of the Luxembourg presidency."
"I would like to underline just one point: the importance of the EU policy towards the Ukraine."
"There is a very serious situation developing in the Ukraine and EU support has been of tremendous importance."
"But we have to say to the Ukrainian authorities that ultimately their fate lies in their own hands, so they must push forward their economic reform which will allow private investment to come in to galvanize their economy."
"On the main issue of enlargement, it was very important that the summit came to the conclusion that this should be an inclusive process within a single framework, but that at the same time we should recognize that each country should be judged on its merits."
"For that reason I support the conclusion that we should proceed at all possible speed with enlargement negotiations with the six countries named."
"We must not allow countries that have been very forward in their reform process - that have gone through a very painful process - to be held back by countries that have been more half-hearted in their approach to this process."
"We must also make it very clear to these countries that the fact that they have joined the negotiations does not guarantee accession to the European Union."
"In view of the report in the Financial Times today, we should perhaps address that particularly to Poland."
"Equally, we have to be clear that any country that makes the right sort of progress should be entitled to join in the enlargement negotiations as soon as possible."
"I particularly welcome the resolution which establishes the European Conference and sets out its content."
"The European Conference potentially could be a powerful engine for deepening and widening the political dialogue and cooperation throughout the European continent."
"That will be very important while the enlargement negotiations are going on in parallel."
"On Sunday night I was rung up by the BBC World Service who wanted me to give a quote on the position taken by the Turkish Government."
"So extreme were the quotes from the Turkish Government as a result of the summit, I was really concerned that something had gone seriously wrong in the summit."
"But when I read the conclusions, it is very clear that we have actually been very positive toward Turkey."
"I cannot therefore understand the statements from the Turkish Government."
"Perhaps it is because the Americans have given them ideas beyond what the European Union can deliver - because Americans constantly believe we can take Turkey into membership - or perhaps it could be because of their domestic situation."
"Either way, we have heard a lot from the Turkish Government about their rights recently, but nothing about their obligations."
"EU membership brings rights and obligations."
"We should reinforce that message to the Turkish Government; but equally we should say we will be delighted for them to join in this process because we recognize their position within Europe."
"This is an important process."
"Let us not forget that at the end of the day it needs the assent of the people of the European Union and the applicant states."
"Therefore the solutions that we seek to the problems have to be realistic and acceptable to the people of Europe."
"Mr President, following the truly historic Council of Luxembourg, in which we all recognize with admiration the constructive role of Mr Juncker, two hopes have been raised."
"The first hope is that Turkey, despite its negative behaviour all these years and its peevish reaction to yesterday's decisions of the 15 Member States, will realise that nobody is denying its position in Europe and that it is its own activities and oversights that, since 1963, have prevented the upgrading of its relations."
"The second hope, allied to the first, is that the whole of Cyprus will not only accede with the greatest possible speed, as of right - and President Santer underlined this fact - to the European Union, but that it will cease to be the hostage of the country that invaded it."
"Now Turkey has a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate its Europeanness instead of running off in indignation to the Americans or the Russians."
"It now has the opportunity to take advantage of what Europe is offering and above all to reinstate, for the sake of its people, the rule of law."
"Mr President, I believe that at the start of each six-monthly term of office for the Council's presidency, there are two major dangers which have to be avoided."
"One is the danger of thinking it possible, in such a short time, to resolve each and every one of the problems facing the European Union."
"The second danger is that imbalances should arise in that constant dynamic between defending legitimate national interests, on the one hand, and the common interest on the other - which is the dynamic which drives the evolution of the European Union and makes it work."
"I believe the job of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is to unite wills, forge agreements and make sure, in short, that the European Union moves forward."
"Well, as Mrs Lulling said, both the important employment summit at the end of November, and the European Council last weekend - when a decision was made on the start of membership negotiations - the current Presidency of the Council has demonstrated that some of the large Member States of the European Union are small as regards their European ambitions, whereas some small Member States are large, in terms not just of their ambitions for Europe, but also of the results they achieve."
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"I will first of all join in the praise which has been given to the Luxembourg presidency for the excellent work which it has carried out."
"A key role in an historic summit in Luxembourg, a fine employment summit; good work has simply been done by Luxembourg, and I think this ought to be mentioned."
"I have three small points."
"Firstly, Turkey."
"The impression has been created in the outside world that Turkey was rejected on the basis of the fact that it is largely a muslim country."
"Worse still, the impression has been created that the Christian Democratic parties were largely responsible for this."
"I find this curious."
"We all know that Turkey has been deterred for the sake of human rights, because of its dubious democratic character and because of the way border disputes and minority problems are solved, namely through military force."
"I assume nonetheless that once these problems are solved in Turkey, it will be more than welcome."
"I would like to hear it again from the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Then there is the issue of the European central bank."
"I hope that we will be able to depend on the fact that the choice for President of the European Central will not be a political one, but one based on the basis of personal qualities."
"I think it is very dangerous that all manner of discussions are held to satisfy various countries with shared presidencies: for four years it will be one, the next four another."
"I have a feeling that we are entering deep water."
"May I hear from the President-in-Office of the Council what he thinks of this."
"National contributions to the European Union."
"In my country an unpleasant debate is being conducted about the Netherlands' high contribution, and about the report by the European Commission which is alleged to prove the contrary, and the response to this from the European Commission."
"I would find it helpful if the European Commission would clarify on this as soon as possible, as it is bad for the image Europe in my own country."
"I have asked a question about this in writing, but if Commissioner Oreja was able to say something about it now, it might also give some comfort in the Netherlands."
"I am now going to give the floor to Mr Bourlanges, but first of all I would like to protest once more because the Group of the European People's Party is giving its distinguished members speaking time of one minute, and this puts the Chair in an impossible position."
"I cannot interrupt colleagues who have a speaking time of one minute. This puts me in an impossible situation."
"I understand the groups' problem."
"Naturally, there are many requests to speak, I know that very well, but all the same, I would like to request that the political groups give colleagues a speaking time of at least two minutes so that they are able to make their points."
"Mr President, your request touches the modest backbencher that I am."
"This Parliament has an obsession: not to enlarge itself, but to succeed at enlargement."
"How far has Luxembourg contributed to achieving this success?"
"Amsterdam was disappointing on the level of institutional reform."
"We decided, then, to commence negotiations without undertaking reforms."
"The European summit of Luxembourg introduced an essential notion, that of the need for reform to precede enlargement."
"We are very grateful to you, Mr President."
"Does this mean we are satisfied?"
"Certainly not, for we consider that there are many things which still need to be clarified."
"I will quote three of them: the timetable, the nature of reforms, the procedure for reform."
"Regarding the timetable, it seems to me that you remain set on the idea of a two stage reform: a small reform before admitting the sixteenth member on the one hand, and a large reform before that of the twenty first on the other."
"We want, we wish a global reform, perfectly compatible furthermore with the Amsterdam provisions, and on the principle that if you can do something complicated, you can do something simple."
"On the nature of reforms, we consider that reform of the Commission and of the weighting of votes is good, but that it is the whole of the balance, political, institutional and administrative, that must be revised within the perspective of a substantial enlargement."
"On the problem of procedure, finally: the method of the Intergovernmental Conference has shown its limitations."
"We want a reform which will enable coherence and more democratic deliberation to be ensured."
"You have laid your stone of the building."
"It is not enough, but you have done your duty."
"You leave it to your successors to continue and for the moment, dear friends in the Luxembourg presidency, some of whom I see exhausted by such efforts, I will say thank you and above all have a good holiday, take a rest, you deserve it!"
"Mr President, The Luxembourg European Council may be considered, in the main, to have been successful."
"The decision on initiating draft negotiations and negotiations for membership with Cyprus and the main eastern European countries is very important."
"It was good that, in deciding the scope of the next EU budget, we went into extra time."
"Now we can give proper attention to what resources and means we can have recourse to in the fight against unemployment."
"We must ensure that resources targeted at unemployment and social inequality are not reduced, and that they be used more efficiently in the future, especially in the creation of new jobs."
"The hardest decision concerns how we democratically monitor the EU monetary union."
"It was good that the status of the Ecofin council was properly defined and that member states were given the opportunity to hold policy talks on decisions regarding monetary union, but the basic problem remains."
"There is still little opportunity for ordinary citizens to supervise the work of the central bank and have a say in monetary policy."
"Tradition has it that European democracy reflects common, public opinion in all political decisions."
"But its powers of influence are tenuous when it comes to the work of the European central bank."
"The European Parliament will work towards democracy being an intrinsic part of monetary union."
"It was a race against time getting here, but, anyway, thank you for allowing me to take part in the talks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this debate I would very rapidly like to say a few words, I would not go as far as to say to close the debate, but as a provisional conclusion."
"I would very briefly like to reply to those who have continued to question the presidency during this afternoon's session."
"I would first of all like to say to Mr van Velzen that it is not my impression that the European Council on employment simply forgot to mention the idea of introducing a so-called social VAT in the countries who wish it."
"In the guidelines there is a very direct reference to the reduction of VAT rates in particularly labour intensive sectors."
"The Member States who want to embark on this path will be able to do so, as long as they have been authorized to do so via a directive that the Council will have to adopt, following a proposal for a directive from the Commission."
"We have left it until the last minute in order to avoid following those of our Member States who wanted to make sure that no reference was made to this idea of a social VAT."
"It must be said that, in fact, only four or five Member States agreed with this idea being mentioned."
"We have therefore been able to pick up this idea again, which I know is so dear to Mr van Velzen's heart, in an optional manner."
"For the rest, with regard to the employment summit, I am grateful to all those who have noted that the presidency has taken up all of Parliament's suggestions since, on re-reading Parliament's report on the employment summit, I can find no guideline which has not been taken up in the guidelines proposed by the presidency and taken up by the European Council, apart from a few literary elements that we were unable to take up but which we have replaced with other similar elements."
"On the subject of the presidency of the European central bank, we would have liked to give an answer to this question, which has not taken shape following intervention on the part of the Luxembourg government, but on the part of a Member State not far from Luxembourg and of which I am using the official and working language at this very moment."
"In fact, I believe that the conditions are right for us to be able to resolve this problem before it becomes substantial, which could run the risk of threatening the credibility of the monetary initiative in Europe."
"At this precise moment, we have two candidates. It will be necessary to have reduced this to one by the end of the year or the first weeks of next year."
"Indeed, if we continue to cultivate this double candidature, it could very quickly come to be perceived that each candidate is representing a different policy."
"There is competition between men and we must make sure that there is not soon to be competition between policies."
"I believe that we must be in a position to bring the discussion to a close."
"Initiatives will be taken before the end of the year to try to bring this problem to a conclusion."
"I could make numerous comments about national budgetary contributions, but I do not wish to do so today."
"The Commission has, furthermore, presented a report, in which it has noted, if in a general way, that the current division more or less appropriately reflects the real situation in different member countries."
"Those who have read it have applauded it, if the conclusions seemed to them to be going in the right direction."
"Those who have different opinions or those who have not read the report, have said that it lacks content and ambition."
"Furthermore, all of the reports that the Commission presents in this respect are, very often, of an exemplary mediocrity."
"We have often said that we cannot reduce membership of the European Union, and the virtues of this membership, to a purely budgetary ebb and flow."
"It is a simplified and reduced idea of Europe, which gives no reason to all those who, because of considerations which go far beyond simple budgetary considerations, continually praise the virtues of the European Union."
"To reduce Europe, and thus peace, to a few budget lines, really stems from a mediocrity that never fails to exasperate me."
"It is a false debate for which there are no grounds. It must be objectified."
"The Commission will apply itself to this, as will others."
"The Commission will make a new proposal on own resources, it has been invited by the European Council to present this in October 1998."
"This will be the time for a detailed and in-depth discussion on all the problems relating to this matter."
"With regard to Turkey, I would like to say and repeat that the European Union - for the first time fifteen of us, which we often do not note - has been able to formulate an offer aimed at this country, an offer which I would say shows that all the doors of Europe are open to Turkey on condition that - and this is the same for all countries wanting to join - she is able to fulfil a certain number of demands which we impose upon ourselves and which we must be in a position to impose on all those who wish to join the European Union."
"It must be said and repeated, explained and re-explained to those who are watching us sympathetically in Turkey - and this is the majority of this dignified, proud and noble people - that Europe has not said no to Turkey."
"Europe, which is not a club of Christians which would want to remain a club of Christians, must explain that it is a club which has certain rules regarding tolerance, that it has within it a basis of common rights, demands, duties and obligations and that anyone who wishes to join the club, which is in fact a community and a union, must answer these demands."
"The modest backbencher who has just left us for reasons which escape me, when he knew that I was going to provide a reply likely to satisfy him, questioned us on the significance of the preliminary issue concerning the need for the European Union to put in place a weighty institutional reform."
"I would have liked to have said to Mr Bourlanges, but I am sure you will report back my comments to this modest backbencher, as he called himself before raising the question, that amongst the Member States there are two sensibilities."
"There are those who would like to see a fundamental reform take place before we proceed to the first enlargement and there are those who would like to see more modest reforms at the same time as preparing for the first enlargement."
"I would like you to know, at the end of this presidency and when I can again begin to express my personal views once more without having to submit myself to the heavy constraint of having to comment on behalf of fifteen prime ministers, which is a difficult thing when they are always changing their minds, I would like to say personally and on behalf of my government, that we will support the efforts of all those who want the institutional reforms to be coherent, substantial, deep and with an eye to the future, whenever we can."
"We would like to be in a position to carry out serious work from the start, on condition, however, that we do not find ourselves once again on the margins of the debate. The poor comments of some political forces, in some of the larger Member States, have resulted in the smaller states turning against them, rebelling, and not being able to reflect with the desired calm, tranquillity and serenity, on these questions."
"If certain large Member States stopped playing this little game, for which there has never been any justification, and which consists of explaining to the smaller countries that they are a group which is preventing the big ones from progressing; if certain politicians in certain large Member States could bring to an end these kinds of comments, which have had no empirical justification throughout the last thirty years, and admitted that where there are substantial and lasting blockages it is because of disagreements between the big countries, then the small ones would be more easily inclined to envisage a relative weakening of their position."
"I believe that if we want to reform our institutions we will have to make sure that we all have the impression of having learnt once again how to respect ourselves better."
"If we no longer like Europe, institutional reforms will not get us very far."
"I would like to wish you personally, Mr President, and all of your colleagues who have willingly listened to me, and indeed all of the members of the European Parliament, happy end of year holidays."
"I wish you a happy new year, a good British and Austrian year, and I hope, a good European year."
"Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, I do not know the extent of the modesty of our colleague to whom you are referring, but in my own country we always say that you should take what people say on face value, thus if he considers himself modest, modest he must be."
"I do not want to excuse him, but I must at least explain to you that he has had to attend another meeting which started at 3.30 p.m."
"He left twenty minutes late and he was very sorry not to have been here to hear your reply."
"Unfortunately, as you know, when we are here we have parallel meetings of which there are not dozens, but hundreds, and so it is always a little difficult to be everywhere at the same time."
"As for me, I would simply like to thank you once again for your presence here, and for your parliamentary spirit."
"You wanted to reply in person at the end of a day of debate."
"I am not sure that we have given you the best proof of your talent, due to the organization of this debate, which has been interrupted two or three times."
"The European Parliament is a little strange, and we apologize all the same for this."
"We are coming to the end of an extremely enriching debate and we would like to thank you for your presence right to the very end and to congratulate you once again for the great presidency which a country, not one of the largest, has been able to take on for the third time."
"Ah, the modest parliamentarian has just arrived."
"I would like to thank you once again and congratulate you, Mr Prime Minister."
"Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the resolution on the Luxembourg Presidency will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Commission work programme for 1998 (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Commission work programme for 1998."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want my speech today to be a routine detailed listing of each and every one of the proposals set out in the legislative programme."
"I would prefer this debate to be relevant to the way the European Parliament exercises its powers of control, and the Commission explains and gives an account of itself, as befits a democratic system such as our own."
"I also think this is the time to take stock and draw conclusions for the future."
"This year - 1997 - has been an important year for the European Union because of the great number of questions addressed, and because of the important political events which have taken place: the Intergovernmental Conference; the employment summit; technical decisions about the implementation of economic and monetary union; and the extremely important decisions about enlargement made at the European Council in Luxembourg last weekend."
"I think 1998 is also going to be an important year, because that is when membership negotiations will begin, decisions will be taken about which countries will participate in the third phase of economic and monetary union, and substantial progress must be made in the difficult matter of the financial perspectives and the reform of Community policies."
"I can assure you that the Commission will continue to fulfil its role as the driving force behind Community initiatives and defender of the general interest, as it has done so far."
"Before I present the work programme, please allow me to address three very topical questions."
"Firstly, are there too many consultation documents?"
"Did we produce too many consultation documents during 1997?"
"Have we been a bit slow, and not keen enough on bringing out new legislative initiatives?"
"In fact, with more than half these documents, we are fulfilling formal demands of the treaty, or obligations arising from an act of derived law, or from petitions from Parliament or the Council."
"Allow me to quote a few figures to put the problem into perspective: in 1997, the Commission presented 13 White or Green Papers, 103 communications - some of them virtually compulsory, while others were consultation documents - and 116 reports, all of which were requested of us."
"Firstly, in accordance with the Subsidiarity Protocol, the Commission has to carry out consultations prior to each legislative proposal. Secondly, we need to take account of the views of all the varied organizations and associations which are so active in Europe, since they make a major contribution to the quality and feasibility of the initiatives."
"And finally, the Commissioners need to have a firm idea of what is needed, and what will work."
"You may ask me - I may ask myself - whether we have misused this method. Have we produced consultation documents when we should have produced initiatives, because it was the easy option?"
"I do not think so."
"But I can assure you, the Commission will work hard to ensure that it can never be accused of legislative laziness."
"The second matter I want to mention is codification and consolidation."
"Because of what the Treaty of Amsterdam says about transparency, consolidation and codification have become one of the Commission's political priorities."
"Obviously, transparency cannot be achieved by this means alone, since the treaty also demands a specific legislative initiative."
"But there has to be constant codification to improve public access to Community legislation."
"It is true that not many codifications have been carried out, but the relevant departments of the three institutions are working on the set of codifications which have been announced."
"It is also true that codification is often delayed because of changes in legislation."
"Obviously, we cannot hold back basic decisions just for the sake of codification, and you would be the first to criticize us if we did."
"Text revision, which will probably be the method used in future, does not present this problem."
"As far as consolidation is concerned, work is progressing fairly well."
"In two years there have been 310 consolidations, based on 2, 500 documents."
"I should like to request this House to look favourably on the setting up of the necessary appropriations to allow this work to be done properly."
"The third matter is the success of codecision."
"Despite having experienced problems, and a proliferation of statements in the proceedings, the fact is that we have worked together well."
"This is best illustrated by the result - the Treaty of Amsterdam - which simplifies the procedure and allows codecision to be applied more widely."
"Mr President, I now propose to talk about the implementation of our 1997 work programme, and in particular, how what we actually did compares with what we said we were going to do."
"I am well aware that there have been delays, and I realize that we need to be stricter in future."
"However, in several cases the delay was caused by our having to consult on certain political or technical points, which takes time to do properly, in order to achieve an effective and consistent proposal."
"That is a very important aspect of the way the Commission exercises its initiative."
"Thanks to that power of initiative, we can for example request to Council that proposals should be put to the vote, as happened during the last few weeks with the Robert Schuman action and tobacco advertising."
"That is something Parliament has always requested."
"I think the way forward has been opened up, and that is the route we should continue to take."
"The same can be said - as I think should be recognized - of the requests you have made applying article 138b. In every case, the Commission has given an immediate response, although such a response does not necessarily have to involve presenting a proposal."
"Presenting proposals is the Commission's responsibility."
"Nevertheless, Parliament can request such a proposal because of article 138b."
"For example, in the case of public liability insurance, the Commission has presented the proposal you requested."
"We have prepared a White Paper on the prevention of damage to the environment."
"As regards forestry strategy, we are preparing initiatives in accordance with the proposals in Agenda 2000."
"In two cases - hotel safety and the European health document - we have encountered problems (mainly of a legal nature) which need to be resolved before we can present a useful proposal."
"However, we hope to find solutions to meet your demands for a European health document."
"And as for safety measures against hotel fires, the Commission has already informed Parliament of the obstacles which are preventing us from presenting the requested proposal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to repeat something I said at the beginning: it is absolutely not true that the Commission has been idle."
"I must remind you that we have had priorities of great political importance, which have taken up all our attention."
"Let me mention just a few of them: firstly, preparing initiatives to combat unemployment (which contributed greatly to the success of the extraordinary European Council in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November); secondly, actively participating in the intense work and hard negotiations of the Intergovernmental Conference, the result of which - the Treaty of Amsterdam - will have to be ratified during 1998; thirdly, the communication on Agenda 2000, which is a keystone of enlargement and Community policy reform (especially the structural funds, the common agricultural policy and the future financial perspectives); fourthly, the whole set of technical proposals in connection with the implementation of the single currency; fifthly, preparing the Kyoto agreements on environmental matters; sixthly, negotiation on the liberalization of the financial services of the World Trade Organization, successfully concluded in Geneva a few days ago; and lastly - one of our highest priorities - the launch and initiation of a plan of action for the single market, which was adopted in April and presented at the European Council in Amsterdam, and includes specific proposals to make the internal market more effective."
"The work and political effort which these activities demanded of us probably meant that some legislative initiatives had to be delayed, as well as certain consultation documents which some Members of Parliament are quite rightly calling for."
"Is this delay justified?"
"Probably not in every case."
"But I want to emphasize that the Commission has concentrated on those areas which it judged to be the most important, and has worked hard to sketch out a strategy for Europe for the next ten years."
"I hope you will recognize the efforts the Commission has made."
"Allow me to pass on quickly to our priorities for 1998."
"President Santer has already described them, and I do not think any of them can be neglected."
"In particular, I am thinking of the following: firstly, to continue our employment strategy at European level; secondly, enlargement, which was set in motion at the weekend and is going to require us to make an exceptional effort, both political and technical, to develop and prepare the negotiations, the reform of the funds and the common agricultural policy, and the introduction of the euro; and lastly, actions for the benefit of the people of Europe - especially the conclusions of Amsterdam and the Kyoto Conference."
"We must also remember our external policy, which demands far-reaching action, as regards both the World Trade Organization and the strengthening of our presence in the politics of diplomacy and security."
"Furthermore, the institutions must progress quickly in this sphere, just as with Schengen's ""communitarization' , to be able to apply the Amsterdam decisions."
"As regards freedom of movement and immigration, penal justice, and justice within the third pillar, the Commission is starting to get ready for the new treaty being applied. There are proposals already on the table, and others in preparation."
"We will also present an action programme for justice and internal affairs, as soon as we can."
"In preparing the programme for next year, there are two major institutional commitments which need a mention: to prepare an amendment to the 1987 decision on comitology, which we have promised to present to Parliament and the Council by June; and to prepare a document on future institutional reforms, which was requested by Parliament for the European Council in December 1998."
"As you know, the Commission has committed itself to that politically, as I confirmed in this House in connection with our Agenda 2000 communication."
"To conclude, I should like to mention the relations between our two institutions."
"We have presented a list of proposals which we hope to tackle in the coming year."
"Our work programme and our list of legislative proposals are the result of our having used our right of initiative, and we do not want them to be seen as excessively unilateral on the part of the Commission."
"Parliament must be involved in next year's programme, and its development."
"It is true that the European Union's parliamentary system is not based on the dialectics between a majority and an opposition, but the Commission cannot be founded solely on the legitimacy conferred on a single occasion, at the investiture vote."
"We need a permanent political reference, democratically elected, to confirm that legitimacy, and I think the example of the mad cow affair has a particular significance."
"I think Parliament has constructively fulfilled its true function of control."
"However, it has also been clearly shown that we will never build a healthy Union based on a lack of transparency or a feeling of mistrust between the public and the institutions, nor of refusal on the part of people in power to bow to democratic control."
"I am about to finish."
"The Commission has committed itself to helping to consolidate the building of Europe, and to endorsing the Union's highly positive initiatives designed to combat unemployment, reach the environmental targets set in Kyoto, make sure the euro is brought in on time, complete the single market, and undergo enlargement."
"I think Parliament and the Member States share that commitment. In short, I think our future depends on effective cooperation between the institutions."
"Therefore, we do not want this to be a routine exercise. We are not preparing a simple, bureaucratic series of lists, of varying degrees of controversy."
"We are embarking on a real political programme."
"On that basis, I beg Parliament to work with us to accomplish it, and thereby renew its confidence in this Commission."
"Mr President, I would really like to repeat what I said last year."
"I looked at the text on my hard disk again this morning, and I could really use it again, verbatim."
"Mr President, we are having a debate today which is a gauge in relations between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"We are having a debate today in which we can see each other about how the Commission and the European Parliament might help each other to bring Europe closer."
"We started in 1995 with Commission Santer taking office."
"The first year was for reflection, in the second year, 1996, the theme was do less to do more, in 1997 much has been done."
"You yourself have already mentioned it, Mr Oreja."
"We have had the IGC with the Treaty of Amsterdam, Agenda 2000 with all the attendant work, the employment summit, completion of the internal market, the entire fiscal case, and in addition, a whole host of achievements."
"You will not hear me say that the Commission has not done anything."
"What we are saying, is that what was announced on paper for the 1995, for the year 1996 and for the year 1997 has not reached us yet; what together should we be doing now?"
"Mr President, I would like to repeat again, that we are also each other's partners."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission: can we not find a method, a procedure for adjustment to check, say, every three months, whether all the activities which we have planned still fit the priorities we have set together?"
"That was one point."
"Secondly, I wonder if you could tell me why at certain times you do not get through to the Council."
"Why are you not able to clear things much more quickly, or in any case tell Parliament about it?"
"Mr President, I would like us to take an example from the way Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Bonino handled the BSE case, the way in which Parliament was involved in this."
"I think that such a method allows us, Parliament, to work much better, as regards speed and intensity, as well as concerning the Commission."
"I said a short while ago that if there are unpleasant words in the resolution, Mr Oreja, you should not take it personally."
"You have been entrusted with this responsibility for coordination."
"But I have a feeling that all those distinguished Commissioners hand you a list via the computer, that this list is stapled together, and subsequently submitted to Parliament."
"I think - and maybe my view is a little too simplistic - that this must be what happens."
"I have a feeling that on that point, with regular consultation and with the major example of the BSE inquiry, possibly via the Conference of Presidents, we will be much better able to give shape to the friendship we feel for each other."
"Mr President, I do not accept the argument Commissioner Oreja uses, either: namely that this Parliament asks so many questions."
"May I give an example which just came to mind, from my own experience?"
"Remote selling - financial services - had an chance."
"The Commission proposed it."
"The Commission removed it after the first reading."
"And then we needed statements, memorandums and a new directive to reinstate what was taken out."
"Mr President, the trouble it is not only Parliament, but also the Commission."
"The only demand, and it has also been incorporated in the resolution, islet us find a way to arrive at better harmony."
"If there is a word in the resolution that disturbs you, then we can talk about it."
"Mr President, at the risk of again being mistranslated, because the last time I spoke Swedish the word travestera , travesty, became transvestite in translation, I am using Swedish again."
"I can agree with what the previous speakers said, that the work programme debate is quite meaningless."
"I am surprised at the explanations which the Commissioner gave regarding the challenges which, according to him, are the reason why the legislative programme has not been realized."
"They were known when we adopted and debated the programme last time."
"On the other hand, I do not think the proposal from the large Groups, the majority, for a joint resolution is serious, with 50 different points which we should consider during the coming year."
"None of the institutions would manage that."
"Firstly, I believe that we in Parliament must also be informed about the new programme document which the Commission is about to start using."
"At the same time we have to agree that agenda work and preparing ourselves for the turn of the Millennium are the most important things."
"We must also make sure that we help the Commission to use its existing powers as much as possible."
"As far as the whole work programme is concerned, we now know after the debate in Luxembourg that there are other priorities which have risen above those in the work programme."
"I am thinking, for example, of the issue of food safety."
"Are the legislative proposals which were sought by the European Council going to come during next year or not?"
"The same applies to the northern dimension, which was mentioned in the Council's resolution."
"I believe this is one of the problems of the work on the legislative and work programme for the Commission during next year."
"Mr President, in the legislative programme submitted by the Commission, the new regulations on the reform of the common agricultural policy take up a fundamental space, and we hope that the time is right! 1998 should be a year of reform, because time runs on mercilessly and the common agricultural policy cannot only be the object of theoretical debate."
"Reform has been announced for the common agricultural policy for too long."
"It was in 1995 in Madrid that Commissioner Fischler adopted the famous strategy paper on European agriculture, in which it was said that the status quo would not have prevailed for long."
"Finally, in 1997, almost two years later, the first proposals arrived with the Agenda 2000."
"However, if we take into account the uncertainties and doubts in the Agenda 2000 and the time that is slipping away, we fear that the option of the status quo that was hunted from the door may come back in through the window."
"According to our group, however, there is an urgent need for changes in the common agricultural policy, and the 1996 Court of Auditors report sets out several problems including that of cohesion."
"On 13 and 14 November, we, as a socialist group, held a conference on the future of the CAP, seeking to state our own, tracing the lines of thought and stating that the agricultural policy needs a new legitimation, because popular consent risks becoming weaker."
"We may lose the common agricultural policy, with its task of solidarity, along the road, for, when some Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance take stock of the debit and credit sides of the Community budget, they often mention the common agricultural policy."
"The only way to recover this consent, this relationship with society, for the common agricultural policy, is to face the challenges both within and outside the CAP, the European and international challenges, with far-sightedness and without any fear of calling the present inertia into discussion."
"We do not think the Commission is seeking to demolish the CAP with Agenda 2000."
"However, we feel that, on decisive matters such as the ceiling for aid, modulation and eco-compatibility, the call to subsidiarity is made a little too comfortably, leaving the ball in the court of the Member States."
"We have therefore confirmed a quality policy, a rural policy, new attention to Mediterranean products and simplification, and we anxiously await the draft regulations in the early months of 1998."
"Mr Commissioner, our group will not adopt any unnecessary delaying tactics or, worse still, exploitation of difficulties, but we will want to contribute towards giving the common agricultural policy a future, so that it becomes a better means of accompanying the effort made by companies wishing to be competitive and face the ever more complex and global market on their feet."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to certain areas that have to do with the external relations of the Union, which, in fact, are mentioned in the Commission programme, as this has been put before us."
"The first area is the new transatlantic agenda."
"This is a very important area and needs a great deal of preparation, which has already been demonstrated by what we have seen up till now in Europe's relations with the United States."
"The second area is the preparation of Europe for its participation in the fresh round of negotiations for the new GATT, which begins in 1999."
"This is a matter which, if we wish Europe to remain a strong producer, as it has been up till now, needs very careful preparation, especially at a legislative and institutional level."
"The third issue concerns Russia and the Ukraine."
"The relations between Europe and Russia and the Ukraine and the fact that very soon both Russia and the Ukraine will be knocking once again on Europe's door, and for much more than hitherto, is something that we must consider."
"Fourthly, the Middle East."
"This is an area which is of great significance to Europe and to which Europe is already paying a great deal of money, without however this being offset by political presence."
"Very specific proposals are needed here which will help to revive the peace process."
"And finally, the Balkans."
"European policy in the Balkans cannot and must not be restricted to the enormous effort that is being made for reconstruction. There must also be many imaginative proposals as to how the Balkan states can come closer to us."
"Mr Commissioner, I refer first to the written form of the working programme of the Commission, where you quite rightly identify Agenda 2000 and the preconditions for enlargement again and again as one of the most important projects, and in your speech itself you identified that as a cornerstone."
"I was all the more disappointed that you did not mention institutional reform in the written version of the plans."
"I am therefore very glad that now in your speech you identify the task of the European Parliament, to present the essential contents of institutional reform by the end of the coming year, as a task of the Commission."
"I consider that to be quite essential, because we know that there will be enough political resistance against enlargement, which some people would like to postpone while pointing at the absence of institutional reform."
"I am really afraid that institutional reform or the demand for it will be misused to prevent the enlargement of the European Union."
"We must fight against that together, on the one hand the European Commission as the motor of agreement in our institutional structure, and on the other hand you will find in the European Parliament, or at least large parts of this Parliament, massive support for sensible and far-reaching institutional reform."
"I therefore ask you, in accordance with the decision of this Parliament, to accept institutional reform as one of the most important cornerstones of the tasks of the Commission in the coming year."
"Three minutes, Mr Oreja, what can I say in three minutes about this working programme?"
"A difficult question."
"Normally I have no problem with it, but this time I have."
"For instance, I could ask you whether your submissions are a kind of cover-up, and with that I am saying rather more clearly what Mr Fayot wrapped up much more elegantly and politely in his speech."
"The Commission - and I know that it is wrong to chastise you yourself for it, and therefore I apologize to you personally, but you are here so to speak responsible for your colleagues - the Commission has submitted several documents: a document about new legislative initiatives, with a Commission number; a document about political priorities, with a Commission number; a document about what you have done in 1997 - unfortunately not about what you have not done - with a Commission number."
"What interests me most, that is the indicative list of what you intend for this year, without a Commission number, is incidentally the thickest document with the most proposals."
"That means that we can rely on something perhaps coming or perhaps not."
"Then I will say something about what everyone here expects from me."
"We have voted in the last month on a decision about whether the Commission deserves to be sent home, whether the Commission deserves - indirectly of course - a declaration of no confidence."
"We said no."
"I made a speech here which was full of praise for the Commission."
"In the last year, as chairperson of the BSE Monitoring Committee, I have often praised the Commission, including you, when you were in my committee."
"But I now have no more reason at all to praise you!"
"Not you personally, Mr Oreja, not Mr Bangemann and not many others."
"Where is the legislation in the follow-up to BSE, where is what we want?"
"Yes, there is a Green Paper about food law."
"But where is the proper legislation about it?"
"Where is the framework directive about food, food control, hygiene and other aspects?"
"I have a slight feeling, Mr Oreja, that the Commission is returning to the doze in which it has been lying for the last ten years."
"I am not prepared to accept that."
"We shall look very carefully at what comes in the next few months."
"None of the documents which I mentioned to you include anything about what specifically you are going to do."
"You the Commission, again not you personally."
"I have nothing at all against Mr Santer saying that they must reflect more."
"I always think reflection is excellent."
"I would just very much like to see a result of the reflection, and I do not want another Green Paper, I do not want another White Paper, I want crisp legislative initiatives."
"I want nutrient identification, I want food hygiene, food control, I want the framework legislation about it!"
"Please go home and say to Mr Bangemann that he should finally fall on his feet and start to become active."
"I know that Mr Bangemann would willingly discuss this with me directly, and I would also willingly discuss it here with Mr Bangemann."
"What is in these many documents, even this semi-official document which does not even have a Commission number, is in no way enough for me to say in the next year that this Commission is doing what it must."
"In no way, Mr Oreja!"
"I am sorry if that upsets you, please pass it on to your colleagues!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of the Committee on Transport and Tourism I can continue seamlessly from what the previous speaker said."
"We in the Committee on Transport and Tourism also fear that in 1998 we will receive more statements and White Papers than specific legislative proposals."
"We regret that, and I hope, Commissioner, that you will talk again to your colleagues and persuade them to rethink."
"I will just take an example from the transport field."
"There we are supposed to receive a statement about the environment and air transport."
"No, Commissioner, we want a quite specific proposal on improving the environmental compatibility of air transport."
"We want to talk to you about that, but not in a general debate about the environment and air transport!"
"I won't say that that is another cover-up, but it is the lack of courage of the Commission to submit something specific."
"But perhaps the Commission is just afraid of the Council, because the Council always pushes unpleasant stories in front of it."
"Road use charges have been pushed backwards and forwards for six months, and they still are."
"But, Commissioner, it is better that we, the Commission and Parliament tell the Council, ""here is the proposed law, confess your inactivity' than that the Commission, prematurely obedient, makes no proposals at all, but sends another statement as food for thought."
"But I will take up a second subject which a previous speaker has already mentioned, and cover it in the transport field."
"We need specific legislative proposals about how, four years after the completion of the internal market, traffic should be regulated from the social point of view."
"We have always said that harmonization and liberalization must go together."
"We have driven liberalization forward very well to a large extent, but harmonization of social, technical and tax conditions for transport is still outstanding."
"I only say that many railway strikes in France, many lorry strikes in other Member States are linked to the fact that people have the feeling that the Commission owes us proposals for the promised harmonization of conditions, particularly in the social field."
"A third field about which I would like to remind you: We have asked the Commission twice in the last year to submit to us within a year - to that extent you still have time, Mr Oreja, but only until February - a quite specific proposal for the calculation of external costs of transport."
"We said as Parliament with an overwhelming majority: Yes, we want to internalize external costs, but we need calculation methods for all types of transport, not just for lorries, because even a nice railway produces dirt and noise, and so do many aeroplanes."
"We therefore asked the Commission to submit to us the external costs of all types of transport on a demonstrably scientific basis, so that we can then internalize the external costs of all types of transport simultaneously."
"But as I know the Commission - here I take up what the previous speaker said - the Commission knew that, but there is not a word about it in the legislative programme."
"And if we are not careful, the Commission will say at the end of 1998 that unfortunately it has had no time."
"The last field: I would like to ask the Commission, although it is clearly not guilty here, and although the Council has again refused to support tourism, to consider in the next year how it can carry out a subsidiary, accompanying support for tourism on the basis of existing policies and programmes, because tourism ensures and creates more jobs and economic growth in the Community than the whole of agriculture."
"Therefore, small and medium-sized companies in particular deserve support for tourism, and we ask for your support on this point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the third German joins the criticism of the two previous speakers."
"The Commission - I will not put it as drastically as my colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt, but I want to do it with a bit more refinement, Mr Oreja - the Commission could be more active."
"I will narrow it down to the field of internal policy in the European Union."
"If the Commission does not become more active, it contributes by its passivity to strengthening more and more a dangerous development which has begun in the European Union, that is the immense remoteness from democracy which is gaining ground in this Union."
"I do not become tired of showing this Chamber that the Council - and particularly certain Member States - block things. We heard yesterday from Mrs Gradin that some initiatives of the Commission failed because of the veto of states which were not named yesterday, but we know which Member States they are."
"But when they arrive in Brussels, these things remain in the inter-governmental area and are not passed to the European Parliament, even in accordance with the construction of the Treaty of Amsterdam, not as the legislative Chamber and very often not even for consultation."
"They are thus practically removed from the democratic control of the national parliaments, and not transferred to that of the European Parliament."
"This democratic deficit becomes quite difficult when institutions which acquire rights to intervene in basic civil liberties are created."
"I do not need to repeat the Europol debate."
"For instance, if, as we have read in the last few days, data from the Schengen information system is sold to organized crime, I ask who is really controlling responsibility?"
"Who controls these organizations?"
"Neither the national parliaments nor us!"
"Commissioner Gradin yesterday impressively presented to us how weakly she is staffed in this area of the Commission."
"This shows that the Commission has only taken responsibility for this subject insufficiently."
"But just because, unlike us, it has the right of initiative, and could take initiatives to implement freedom of movement within the European Union for instance, it should do so more strongly."
"The Monti initiatives no longer appear in the legislative programme."
"Those were the last initiatives which the Commission took to put into effect the freedom of movement of citizens which was provided in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Single Act, but which was not put into effect within the strategy of the Council."
"The Commission took initiatives."
"As I said, these no longer appear in its working programme."
"Have more courage, then Parliament will support you at all levels!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have two points of view."
"I shall begin with the positive and would like to warmly welcome the cooperation with the USA which has inspired a new strategy with regard to synthetic drugs through, for example, the early warning system against new substances and tougher legislation against producing and dealing in narcotic substances."
"And so to the points which I am less positive about and where I want to know more."
"This concerns organized crime and freedom of movement."
"The Commission itself has said in this House that it has a task to fulfil in 20 paragraphs in the Council's plan of action against organized crime."
"But the work programme for 1998 does not contain anything about this."
"Measures are required with regard to money laundering and the confiscation of criminally obtained assets."
"In addition I would like to stress that there are several paragraphs in the Dublin convention which require implementation."
"The other point concerns freedom of movement."
"We have the Weil report which clearly shows the problems which exist."
"Here the Commission must be more active as a problem solver and attack obstructing countries."
"I can quite an example from my home city of Stockholm."
"More than 3, 000 people do not get their rightful pension in time because the authorities are unable to calculate pensions when people have worked in other countries."
"If it is the case that normal, decent citizens find they have their pension indirectly confiscated, at least temporarily, while criminal assets are not confiscated, the Union will of course risk losing credibility and even democratic support."
"The Commission must have the ability to act as an effective guardian of the treaty, so that we in the Union can deliver both safety and freedom of movement."
"In these areas the citizens have expectations of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank you for all the speeches we have heard here this afternoon."
"Starting with Mr Fayot's speech, which was the first, I fully agree that this is a crucial year."
"And all the more so once Parliament's powers are increased by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The treaty will shortly come into effect."
"As far as possible, we should try to put many of the treaty's provisions into practice before it comes into effect, just as was done so successfully at the European Council in Luxembourg with regard to employment."
"Mr Fayot said the Commission must be subject to Parliament's control, and I fully agree with him, naturally."
"Of course the Commission is not immovable."
"That was Mr Fayot's question, and the answer is categorical: of course the Commission is subject to Parliament's control, as we made very clear in relation to the mad cow affair."
"I believe that is exactly where the basis of the Commission's legitimacy lies."
"What legitimacy would the Commission have if it were not subject to control?"
"I have been a member of two Commissions - this one and the previous one - and I can assure you, I feel my legitimacy has increased since appearing before the European Parliament on 4 January 1995."
"As I left the hearing on that day, I felt I had become more of a Commissioner than I had been before."
"So I fully agree about what it means to exercise that power."
"I also want to say - and I hope this will go some way towards answering Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's comments - that one of the difficulties between Parliament and the Commission probably stems from something I think is particularly important: the system of legal bases."
"I think it is important for us to make progress in establishing the legal bases for the proposals which are made."
"Obviously, that is a matter for the Commission itself, but I think that by giving clues about the legal basis and the type of action which is wanted, relations between the Commission and Parliament can be made easier."
"This is where Mr Fayot's proposal comes in, which was referred to by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and which I wholeheartedly support."
"I think we should make sure we follow his suggestion - and not just once a year, but periodically."
"Mr Fayot, you suggest a three-monthly meeting."
"There is no reason why we should not do that."
"Greatly increased transparency is exactly what the Commission wants."
"Let us meet every three months, in whatever way you prefer."
"It could take place at the committee chairmen's meeting, or wherever you wish."
"At this moment, I cannot give you a response to all the matters which have been raised here."
"Some are legislative matters and others are not."
"But our work should be serious, responsible and punctual, and if we are unable to make progress on a specific matter at a certain time, we should explain why that is, or why we think we have to resort to a Green Paper."
"Mr Fayot, you referred to the concentration of resources, and pluralism. That is not a matter for which I am directly responsible as Commissioner, but as a member of the College, it is my concern."
"You are absolutely right."
"The previous Commission raised this matter and issued a Green Paper, which produced a series of responses."
"And I can tell you, the responses were extremely mixed."
"At that time we were unable to judge them."
"The Delors Commission was about to end."
"We did not know what to do."
"A new Commission was formed and Mr Monti arrived."
"He produced a new Green Paper, to which the responses were again not clear."
"Although the responses from the sector and the social groups were insufficiently clear, Mr Monti nevertheless put a proposal to the College of Commissioners."
"We held a very long debate to discuss the matter, but at the end of the debate the College's position was not clear."
"Mr Monti decided it needed more thought, and I think he was right."
"You believe we have been thinking about it for too long."
"Well, I think a delay of a few more months does not matter if we get it right in the end."
"As you know, the matter you have raised is extremely difficult, and affects many sectors."
"One thing at stake is what the concentration of resources means, and what the consequences may be for the people of Europe."
"There is also the question of what it means to operate a true market economy, and what difficulties there are in acquiring the actions which may perhaps allow that agreement finally to be reached, and how to safeguard interests."
"It is a very serious problem."
"Well, that is one of the issues, and I am sure that we will soon have a debate in the Commission, reach a solution, and put that solution to Parliament. I cannot tell you exactly when that will happen, but I am sure it will not take long because I have seen how deeply Mr Monti is studying the matter."
"I want you to know that we get extremely involved in these matters, and I think a greater degree of transparency can be achieved by changing the method."
"I think that where we have made mistakes has been with the method, and therefore we must improve the method we use in the future."
"I also want to address another of the issues raised here: the question of proposals being blocked."
"My comment is this."
"Firstly, it is true that there are a lot of matters with the Council, but not everything with the Council is being blocked."
"It is likely that we may be able to withdraw some of the matters which are currently with the Council. That is the Commission's right; the right to withdraw is one of the consequences of our right of initiative."
"The reason for withdrawing these matters is that they are obsolete."
"Other matters are currently in an information phase, and yet others are soon to be voted on in Council."
"In any case, I want to assure you that we are going to keep a special watch on these matters."
"I realize that Parliament is particularly concerned about this, and therefore I will give you a reply at the appropriate time, and I hope we will soon be able to hold a meeting to examine the list of matters still to be dealt with."
"I do not propose to say much more, but there is something I want to say to Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I understand your particular concern about that subject."
"As you know, I have already spent a lot of time with your committee, when you asked me many questions about institutional matters, for which I was responsible at the time."
"It was not easy, but I came out of it pretty well."
"However, as regards the matter you have raised - which is very important - we are awaiting the results of the conference organized by the European Parliament and the Commission on 3 and 4 November last year - at the moment we are analysing the consequences of that meeting."
"So you think we should have done it already?"
"Well, sometimes we are a bit slow, but we are reliable."
"Therefore, you can rest assured that we are going to study it in depth."
"We also wanted to know the conclusions of the BSE investigation, and we now have that."
"In a way, we also wanted to know what was happening with the European Council in Luxembourg."
"So I have made a note of your concern."
"Next time, I think you will be entitled to get angry, but please do not lose your temper this time. Please wait, because next time I will be able to give you more categorical answers."
"There were a lot of other speeches."
"I want to mention one or two, for example Mr Dimitrakopoulos' speech."
"I agree that we need to prepare properly for our actions in the area of foreign policy."
"I believe what is currently being prepared should be put into operation immediately."
"We will see how the planning cell works."
"It is one of the results of Amsterdam."
"The new Treaty of Amsterdam has not yet come into force, but the planning cell could nevertheless be put into operation before that happens."
"As for Mr Fantuzzi's speech, I agree with his interesting comments on agricultural policy and the role of subsidiarity."
"Mr Frischenschlager's comment about institutional reform and the extent to which the institutions can affect enlargement is a question about which I am particularly concerned."
"There is a very important point in the resolution approved by this House on 19 November - I think it is point No 20 - concerning Parliament's demand that the Commission should present proposals and report to the European Council to be held in Vienna in 1998."
"I think this is a really important and significant matter."
"If you will allow me to use a very Spanish expression, what we must not do is let the bull catch us, as has happened to date - in Maastricht and Amsterdam. In other words, we must not allow events to overtake us in such a way that, in the end, we do not have enough time left."
"We cannot always wait until the last minute, run out of time, and put it off."
"We cannot allow the Community's method to be one of postponement; it has to be a decisive method."
"Let us not wait until the day before a new state is due to join - much less until there is to be a twentieth, twenty-first or twenty-second state."
"No, let us do it now."
"First, let us wait for the treaty to be ratified, which is the important thing."
"As you well know, nothing can be taken for granted - neither bad things nor good."
"So let us wait now for the treaty to be ratified, and as soon as that has been done, we will set to work."
"If you have charged the Commission with doing something, the Commission will do it."
"And we are going to try to reach an agreement between the Commission and Parliament - and involve the Council too - and try to resolve once and for all this institutional question to which you have drawn attention, without being pressured into it by a new state's final negotiations for membership of the Community."
"Well, those are some of the things I wanted to say to you."
"I also want to say, on the subject of Mr Schulz's speech, that the Commission's commitment to democracy is very clear."
"I think everything that has been done goes to prove that commitment, especially the Intergovernmental Conference, and the Commission's proposals on citizenship, which is not often spoken about - but should be."
"Citizenship was one of the subjects to benefit most from the Intergovernmental Conference, along with codecision."
"Let us attempt to go further."
"We are going to try to do so."
"Turning now to Mr Böge, I want to assure him that I have taken note of his proposals. I do not think this is the right time to reopen the debate on some of the matters which have been raised in relation to the third pillar."
"However, I do believe that the Treaty of Amsterdam has given us a margin there, and we must see how we can stimulate it."
"The most important thing - or one of the most important - is the free movement of persons. We know we must perfect that, and we have a procedure by which to do it."
"The result of Amsterdam is not what I would have liked to have seen; I would have preferred the step to be taken in three years rather than five, and I would prefer it to be by majority rather than unanimity."
"But that is what the Community is like, and has always been like."
"It is never completely satisfactory."
"However, I think we have been shown a way forward, and we are going to try to do it."
"I hope that together, Parliament and the Commission will be able to continue to make progress, once and for all, towards building a Europe truly based on justice and solidarity."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.."
"Investment firms and credit institutions"
"The next item is the report (A4-0380/97) by Mr Cassidy, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 93/6/EEC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (COM(97)0071 - C4-0304/97-97/0124(COD))"
"Mr President, this proposal on the capital adequacy directive is a revision of a 1993 directive and that directive in turn was made necessary in order that the European Community, as it then was, should be able to take advantage of the universal rules which were agreed by the Committee on Banking Supervision in Basle."
"When this House considered the 1993 directive, we were aware that other elements would be required in due course to keep up to date with technical progress, but I do not think we anticipated that technical progress would be quite as rapid as it has been."
"Indeed, the rapid change in the financial services industry has required an updating of the capital adequacy rules to enable financial institutions to calculate something called value at risk, using computer models."
"Under the 1993 directive, computer models are not allowed to be used."
"Under the amendments to the Basle rules and under the amendment to the 1993 directive which we are considering today, they will be."
"However, there was a further obligation imposed on the Commission and Parliament back in 1993, which was to draw up rules to deal with commodities and derivatives, and those have required some substantial changes to the 1993 directive."
"We have all been working under conditions of some difficulty because the new Basle rules come into force on 1 January next year, in other words in two weeks' time."
"One of our principal objectives in the Commission, Parliament and, indeed, the Council is to try to ensure that our amendment to the 1993 directive can be brought into force as quickly as possible in order not to place European Union financial institutions at a disadvantage compared with their competitors in Japan, the United States, Switzerland, Korea, Indonesia etc. assuming that there are still banks in places like Japan, Korea, etc. which are in a fit state to do anything at all."
"Nonetheless, we have to safeguard the position of our own financial institutions."
"Turning to the question of derivatives and commodities, when the Commission proposal was originally brought forward, a problem presented itself in that the Commission's original proposal required commodities firms to modernize their systems so as to be able to use computer models by 31 December 1999 - a significant date because it is the date of the millennium, but also because it is the date by which some countries are trying to get themselves organized for the single currency."
"It has become apparent that there is going to be a desperate shortage of suitably qualified IT personnel, not only in the European Union but in other parts of the world."
"As rapporteur, my original thought was to suggest an extension of that deadline to 31 December 2002."
"However, I have discovered that the Council has been prepared to be rather more generous than that, and Amendment No 19, which will be voted on tomorrow in the name of the PPE and other political groups, and its accompanying Amendment No 20, will help to adjust the positions of commodities and derivatives firms."
"I, as rapporteur, am but the humble servant of the committee and I have to leave decisions on Amendments Nos 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 to the wisdom of the House."
"But if I might presume to guide the House, I have to say that I hope it will see its way to supporting Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 16."
"Some of the others may possibly have been withdrawn."
"Having said all that, we do not have a great deal of time to spare on this."
"I am hopeful that when we come to vote on this report tomorrow, it will go through, if not unanimously, at least with a significant majority in favour, so that Commission and Council can then move as quickly as possible to a common position, thus enabling us to give it a second reading and putting European Union financial institutions on a par with their competitors elsewhere in the world."
"I am very sorry about this but we are going to have to stop the debate at this point and resume it at 9 o'clock this evening."
"It is not in my hands."
"The Vice-President who is taking Question Time wants to start Question Time at 5.30 p.m."
"We have the honour of having the President-in-Office with us, so it is only appropriate we should start on time."
"Mr Wijsenbeek wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, this really is a point of order."
"I think this is a highly unsatisfactory way of doing things here in this Parliament."
"This is the second time today that a debate has been interrupted somewhere in the middle, with full appreciation for the Luxembourg Presidency which worked so incredibly hard during the past six months."
"But you cannot let the rapporteur begin, send for the Commissioner, make sure all speakers are present and then after the introduction say that the debate is now suspended and will resume tonight at 9 p.m."
"Could you please delete my name from the list; I think this is an unsatisfactory way of doing things, and I hold the Bureau responsible, which, as so often, simply does what it feels like."
"Thank you, Mr Wijsenbeek, but I must remind you that we have approved an agenda - all of us - and in that agenda it says that Question Time to the Council begins at 5.30 p.m. today."
"Therefore, Mr Wijsenbeek, I am making sure that we keep precisely to what was approved by this House."
"Furthermore, Mr Wijsenbeek, you are a well-known member of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities - as I know for a fact - and you are aware that there is a section of that committee which also determines how this Parliament operates as regards Question Time."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-1002/97)."
"First of all, allow me to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, and thank him for being here today."
"We greatly appreciate his presence here, but I should also like to mention how valuable it has been to have the Secretary of State, Mr Wohlfart, with us. I should have liked to have wished him a Happy Christmas and New Year."
"Mr Juncker, please be kind enough to pass that message on to him, and also thank him for having attended Question Time during the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Question No 1 by Paul Rübig (H-0832/97)"
"Subject: Dismissal of a secondary school teacher in Slovakia for encouraging use of the minority Hungarian language"
"The efforts being made by Slovakia in the economic sphere in order to become a member country of the European Union are to be welcomed."
"However, the worsening conflict between the Slovakian Government and the Hungarian minority, which is now spreading to education, is all the more disturbing."
"Teachers and head teachers are being dismissed for what are clearly political reasons. This situation mainly concerns Hungarian schools in the bilingual region."
"Mr Alexander Tóth, for example, a Hungarian secondary school teacher, was dismissed on 30 June 1997. The headmasters of two Hungarian schools, Mr Gyula Popélyy and Mr Peter Kovács, were dismissed in October 1997."
"All three had issued their pupils with two-language reports."
"Can the Council of Ministers representative say whether the Council is aware of these incidents and how it intends to respond?"
"Mr President, I am told that this is the first time that a Prime Minister has taken part in this exercise of questions and answers."
"I am doing it firstly because I like the European Parliament a lot, but above all because Mr Wohlfart is not here."
"Mr Wohlfart, my Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who, I am told, normally represents the Presidency brilliantly, cannot be with us because he has been involved in a car accident."
"It is not a serious one, but my government members still do not know how to keep to the road when there is black ice."
"Consequently, Mr Wohlfart has become a victim of the carelessness which characterises the conduct of affairs in Luxembourg."
"I would now like to give the awaited reply following Mr Rübig's question, to say that the Council deplores the incidents described in the question he has put."
"I would like to remind you all of the importance the Council gives to respect for the political criteria of Copenhagen on the part of all countries with a European vocation."
"It is with this in mind that the Council acknowledges the Slovakian Parliament's declaration of 10 October 1997 and the joint declaration of the Slovakian President and Prime Minister on 17 October 1997, declarations which it considers to be a first constructive step towards a solution of the open questions regarding Slovakia."
"It is equally a question, in this case, of the beginnings of a reply to the recommendations drawn up by the joint parliamentary committee between the European Union and Slovakia."
"Regarding treatment of the Hungarian minority in particular, the Council has noted the Slovakian government's memorandum on the use of minority languages, whilst hoping that this initiative will be shortly followed by a specific law governing the different aspects of this question in its entirety."
"The Council has similarly noted with satisfaction the recommendations directed at the Slovakian government by the joint parliamentary committee's session of 25th and 26 November 1997, inviting it to prepare, in cooperation with European Union experts, the relevant legislation in order to find a solution to the problem of minority languages within national territory."
"The European Union is resolved to help all associated countries to satisfy the criteria drawn up in Copenhagen."
"In this context, it has not ceased to encourage the Slovakian Republic to put to good use the time lapse in order to remove the remaining obstacles which stand in its path to full membership of the European Union, whilst hoping that it may be possible to reach, by the same time, a just solution to the problems of the minority in question."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank Prime Minister Juncker very much."
"I think that it is exemplary that you are available to Parliament here in person for questions."
"I believe - and I would like to emphasize this explicitly to this audience, because we were very glad about it - the Council has followed Parliament's line and not mentioned the word Slovakia explicitly."
"Nevertheless we should do everything so that the criteria which are very important for us are fulfilled there."
"The first problem is the minority question."
"The second is the question of Mr Gaulider, the member of parliament, and I believe that we on the European side cannot emphasize too much that the Gaulider question must be solved."
"We know that that is related to President Kovác and with the elections in the autumn, and my question is: Do you believe that the European Union has an opportunity to solve this Gaulider case before the elections in Slovakia?"
"Mr Rübig, on the question of Mr Gaulider and all the other related questions which you have raised, I would like to tell you that I have discussed the questions which you have raised and related questions very intensively with the Slovakian Prime Minister, Mr Meciar."
"This happened at the end of August, on the occasion of a half-day working visit to Slovakia which I made because, precisely at the time when Slovakia was actually excluded from the enlargement process by everyone, I wanted to show through this visit that this does not mean that we are now giving Slovakia the cold shoulder."
"I then discussed this question with Mr Meciar, the president of the republic, the opposition parties in the Slovakian parliament and some other Slovakian friends and colleagues."
"I also took this opportunity to invite both the president and the prime minister to make a common declaration about the accession of Slovakia to the European Union, and I made it clear that we wanted some answers to questions which we brought from outside to be given in Slovakia itself."
"By chance that was precisely the day on which voting on the so-called Gaulider case was due in the Slovakian parliament."
"The vote was then postponed."
"In all discussions with all contacts in Slovakia, I have made it clear that we place the highest value on improved functioning of the democratic institutions in Slovakia, and I also made it clear, in a further conversation with Mr Meciar last Saturday in Luxembourg, that the fact that the European Council has nevertheless explicitly included Slovakia in the enlargement process should not be interpreted as meaning that we are now satisfied with the quality of the democratic processes which have been achieved in Slovakia, but that we assume that further efforts must be made."
"There is Slovakia, there is the Slovakian government, there are also five million Slovak men and women, whose place is in the centre of Europe."
"We should please not forget that, however angry we are about what Mr Meciar does, does not do or fails to do."
"There is not only Mr Meciar, but also five million Slovaks, who are worth our support."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank you very much for being here, and also ask you to pass on our best wishes to your colleague for his recovery as soon as possible, because he has really done outstanding work here."
"I only wanted to put one question about your previous answer: One of Meciar's main arguments is always, in all his speeches, that he recognizes only individual rights and not collective rights."
"Do you intend to emphasize as much as possible that precisely minority questions depend above all on collective rights, and not individual rights?"
"That is always the way in which Mr Meciar tries to avoid a definite answer."
"Mr von Habsburg, minority rights cannot be individualized."
"Minority rights are rights of a particular population group."
"In our conversations in Slovakia, and subsequent conversations with Slovakia, we always pointed to Hungary, Romania, but particularly Hungary, to make clear how we think that minority problems should be handled, or rather minority questions - I much prefer the term minority questions to minority problems, because minorities are not problems, they just raise questions."
"We have always pointed to the Hungarian example to show how we think minority questions should be handled, and I believe that the Slovakian leadership is very aware of this."
"Question No 2 by Jens-Peter Bonde (H-0856/97)"
"Subject: Registration of individuals in the Schengen Information System"
"Can the Member States and/or the Council of Ministers say how many individuals with Danish residence or nationality are registered in the Schengen Information System for the various main categories under which individuals, objects etc. are registered and will the Member States respect the Danish ban on registering lawful political activity in their own files and in those they hold in common?"
"I will say to Mr Bonde that the Schengen Agreement and the convention regarding the implementation of the Schengen Agreement were concluded at an intergovernmental level between certain members of the European Union."
"These agreements do not therefore for the moment come under the jurisdiction of the Council properly speaking, and the honourable gentleman's question should rather be put to the authorities of the Schengen Agreement."
"Mr President, this morning, I thanked the Presidency of the Council for having been so impartial for half a year, and today I would like to thank the Minister of State for coming here and answering questions at question time in person."
"And I would also like to thank him for having given me an answer."
"But I obviously cannot, as it will be given by the Schengen information system."
"So I would like to ask instead whether the Chairman of the Council has considered how we can balance certainty in law against political effectiveness in the records in Schengen and the AIS system which will replace the Schengen system under Europol."
"My suggestion to the Chairman of the Council would be that a rule be introduced whereby, if suspicions no longer exist, the person suspected is sent the information recorded or that, if this cannot be done because of investigations, that information should be given to an independent control authority so that there is always certainty that having suspicions about someone is taken very seriously."
"To reply to Mr Bonde's question, I will simply say that he must be aware that this relates to highly confidential matters; I am talking of the questions to which he is directly referring."
"It is clear that integration of the points to which he has referred into the Schengen information system takes place only by demand of a judicial authority."
"As his question relates directly to the treatment of Danish nationals and residents, I suggest that he puts this question to the Danish Parliament, where all the replies could be provided for him."
"Amongst my youth's ambitions was that of one day being able to speak in front of the Danish Parliament."
"If the Danish Government was in agreement to authorize me to reply to this very question that you will formulate for the Danish Parliament, I would be extremely pleased and honoured to be able to reply to you on behalf of the Danish Government."
"But I do not know if, speaking on behalf of the Danish Government, I would be able to give you a satisfactory response."
"I would like to say that I think this is a very important debate, because the Schengen material will probably become EC law in the near future."
"People often talk of the advantages of the Schengen Agreement, but people must also be able to discuss how it works in practice."
"In the Schengen Information System there is at least a possibility of asking to see your personal information in the SIS database."
"What concerns me most is the confusion about SIRENE, that is the database which lies behind the Schengen Information System, where there is authority to provide much more sensitive personal information than is allowed to be done from the SIS database."
"Does the Council of Ministers think we are going to need to tighten the supervision of the SIRENE database and the information which is provided there so that we shall have a control authority, as in the SIS database, if it is integrated into EC law."
"Thank you, Mr Sjöstedt."
"Mr Juncker, I do not know whether, in your youth, you ever dreamed you were a Member of the Swedish Parliament, but even if you did, I invite you to reply to Mr Sjöstedt's question."
"My childhood dreams concerned only the Danish Parliament."
"It was not my ambition to one day be able to address any more than one Scandinavian parliament."
"As for the rest, personally, I will say that I understand perfectly the fears which can arise from the problems we are now mentioning."
"For my part I would not exclude the fact that it would be wise to search for a suitable ways and means to organize things in order to achieve a real mastery of these problems."
"I see no problem in continuing our common reflection in this regard."
"I perfectly understand the worries that underlie the questions being put to us, but you will understand that I cannot give a ready made reply from the Council."
"A dream may well become a nightmare, and I can say that people in Scandinavia regard joining Schengen as containing a number of potential nightmares."
"The Chairman of the Council is correct in saying that the development which Jonas Sjöstedt touched on in his question has not happened yet, but it is a question of time if Schengen law becomes EU law, i.e. is integrated in the European legal system."
"And, given that there are absolutely fatal problems of certainty in law about personal records, passing on and checking names, as the report which was published in the Spring shows, one might of course think that the Council has had some thoughts (now that it has been resolved to integrate the Schengen system) on how to resolve these problems of certainty in law, which are undoubtedly of a highly fundamental nature."
"My question to the Chairman of the Council is whether such analyses and considerations exist."
"Schengen is a mechanism that was invented to fight against criminality."
"It is not a system which has been put in place to control citizens, their opinions or their convictions."
"Indeed, we forget that Schengen is a mechanism set up to fight criminality more effectively and that its results are very often convincing."
"I am not excluding some lack of control and I would like us to concentrate our thoughts on the means that we could put in place to avoid this."
"We must make a distinction between the principle of Schengen and a number of exceptional failures which it may have given rise to, and which must be avoided at all cost."
"Question No 3 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0863/97)"
"Subject: The associated countries of the Maghreb and ""European voluntary service for young people' (OJ C 302 of 3.10.97)"
"The programme is intended to step up cooperation with third countries with which the Community has signed association agreements, and as regards the participation of the associated countries, it is open to the countries of central and eastern Europe; one of the purposes of the project is to provide Community young people with experience of contacts with other cultures in an intercultural context."
"Could the Council investigate the possibility of opening up participation in this programme to the partner countries of the Maghreb which have signed a euro Mediterranean Association Agreement, i.e. Tunisia and Morocco?"
"What might the timetable for this be?"
"Article 5 of the draft common position approved by the Council during its session on 28 October 1997 clearly states the countries to which participation in this programme is open. It says, ""European voluntary service for youth' ."
"The associated countries of the Maghreb, who have concluded an agreement with the European Union, do not figure amongst the countries stated."
"However, amongst the specific objectives of the programme, recorded in article 2, paragraph 2, appears the intensification of youth participation in transnational activities of community service within the Community, or in third countries, in particular those with which the Community has concluded cooperation agreements."
"Completing this, paragraph 3 of the same article stipulates that support of transnational community service activities of a short or long duration within the Community, or in a third country, is one of the main actions of the programme."
"Similarly, section 2 of the annex of the draft common position anticipates the active participation, in third countries, of young people residing legally in a Member State in activities which contribute to solving the needs of the society likely to have a direct effect on the well-being of the populations of the host communities."
"It follows from this that, at the time of implementing the programme, projects anticipated in one of the countries mentioned in the question could, of course, be considered."
"Judging by the tone and political attitude of the reply given by the President-in-Office of the Council, I assume he said yes."
"However, I do not understand it, because in fact, in the Commission proposal published in the Official Journal on 3 October 1997, it is envisaged that the countries of central and eastern Europe and third countries would benefit and participate in this way, but not the associated countries of the Maghreb."
"I should like him to state precisely whether, as President-in-Office of the Council, he would be in favour of the associated countries of the Maghreb being able to participate in this voluntary service programme, in two ways: firstly, young Europeans being able to do service in these countries, and secondly, the associated countries of the Maghreb being able to participate in the programme in their own right."
"The Council could come to the agreement that you wish as long as it is submitted to a Commission proposal which moves in this direction."
"Mr President, I only have quite a short question."
"In the case of such a fundamental expansion, would the Council also be prepared to increase resources for this programme correspondingly?"
"If the Council was able to associate itself with a proposal made to it by the Commission, it would really have to be interested in making the relevant monetary resources available, in the context of a coherent interpretation of what the Commission would propose."
"But as there is no such proposal by the Commission, we are in a very hypothetical question and answer game here."
"Question No 4 by Gerard Collins (H-0865/97)"
"Subject: Agri-tourism"
"Does the Council accept that agri-tourism can play a significant role in developing the economies of rural areas and will the Council instruct the Commission to put forward measures designed to assist the further development of the agri-tourism sector in the context of the Union's tourism and rural development policies?"
"As the honourable gentleman himself highlights in his question, tourism can contribute to the economic development of rural areas of the European Union, given that economic development of rural areas is traditionally linked to agricultural development."
"The Council shares Mr Collin's opinion that rural tourism offers possibilities which, judiciously exploited, are of a nature which will increase well-being and create jobs in these areas."
"The Council attaches a particular importance to the qualitative improvement of supply in the rural tourism sector."
"Such a step is likely to benefit the development of the areas in question."
"In this context, the Council would like to remind you of its decision 92/421 concerning a Community action plan for tourism."
"Finally, it should be noted that rural tourism plays an important role in the Community's cohesion policy."
"In this regard, it is useful to underline the fact that, within the framework of the structural funds and the Leader 2 Community initiative, according to the most recent estimates, 40 % of the budget of ECU 1, 750 million anticipated for this will be allocated to projects aimed at developing rural tourism."
"I just wish to record my thanks and appreciation to the Prime Minister for his very extensive and comprehensive reply."
"Mr President, I have the following question: As far as agricultural tourism is concerned, we in Austria have a rather special situation, since we have a very large percentage of farmers for whom farming is a secondary occupation."
"I know that this cannot be applied to the whole European Union, but that it is an argument which very much supports this agricultural tourism."
"Would you consider it possible either to provide these part-time farmers with special support for agricultural tourism or to support these farmers, who live in a very special situation, from the agricultural side, so that they can commit themselves more strongly here?"
"Yes!"
"I am very pleased that Mr Habsburg-Lothringen kept his question so short; he did not use up the minute he was entitled to. I am also very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council is being so concise."
"Question No 5 by Sören Wibe (H-0868/97)"
"Subject: EU relations with Israel and Palestine"
"The Israeli government has committed serious breaches of the peace agreements it concluded with the Palestinian State."
"In so doing it has jeopardized peace throughout the Middle East."
"Ought not the Council to respond by imposing sanctions against the State of Israel and, for instance, consider breaking off the trade agreements which the EU has signed with Israel?"
"The situation in the Middle East is a complex one and the Council does not believe that measures such as those suggested would contribute to an end to the impasse in the region."
"The best reply that I can give to you is to return to the Presidency's conclusions published at the end of the European Council held in Luxembourg on 12th and 13th December."
"These conclusions demonstrate once more that the European Union is determined to make a concrete and positive contribution to the peace process."
"Thank you for you answer Prime Minister Juncker."
"As far as the relationship with Israel is concerned, the situation is still that we have repeatedly adopted resolutions in which we have criticized Israel's breaches of the peace agreement in fairly strong terms."
"These resolutions have clearly had no effect whatsoever."
"Is it not so, that the only language Israel understands is if we resort to concrete sanctions, such as in the economic area?"
"It is also so that Israel as a State imposes hard economic sanctions against the Palestinians by, for example, obstructing their export of flowers to the Union."
"I would like once more, at the risk of being boring, to ask whether it is not time for us to begin to consider concrete economic sanctions against Israel."
"I will tomorrow be meeting, in Luxembourg, the Israeli Prime Minister, and on Friday, President Arafat."
"I will have the opportunity of discussing with both representatives the problems to which you are referring, but I will not threaten the Israeli Prime Minister with sanctions during these meetings."
"I do not believe that this is the method we should employ with regard to the State of Israel."
"We need discussions, not threats."
"I entirely agree with what the President-in-Office of the Council has just told us twice, and I should like to ask him if he thinks there is any way of clearly defining, in black and white, what we are always referring to as the spirit of Oslo. I ask this particularly, having read very carefully the text approved by the European Council in Luxembourg."
"I am familiar with the Oslo written agreements, but I am always hearing people talk about violating the spirit of Oslo and I have still not found anywhere a single written reference to the spirit of Oslo."
"I would like to know if the Council would be able to undertake this interesting intellectual task."
"I think the details requested by Mr Robles Piquer must, indeed, be given."
"It is sometimes extravagant to see with what luxurious detail we try to surround vague notions such as ""the spirit of...' , in this case ""the spirit of Oslo' ."
"In fact, we know to what, in general, we are referring when we evoke the spirit of which you speak."
"I will tomorrow have the chance to contribute in a modest way to the search for the spirit which is, it seems to me, a little lost."
"Question No 6 by Karl Habsburg-Lothringen (H-0873/97)"
"Subject: Electoral law in Gibraltar"
"What does the Council propose to do with regard to the law in Gibraltar on elections to the European Parliament?"
"Is it acceptable for EU citizens there to be denied this elementary right on the grounds that Gibraltar would be too small a constituency, thus creating first- and second-class EU citizens?"
"Would the Council consider enabling EU citizens of Gibraltar to cast their vote in or for another EU country, if they are unable to do so through the UK?"
"Mr Habsburg-Lothringen undoubtedly knows that Annex II of the Act of 20 September 1976 relating to the election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage anticipates that the United Kingdom will apply the measures of the Act in question only with regard to the United Kingdom, that is to the exclusion of Gibraltar, which is not part of the United Kingdom."
"The 1976 Act was adopted on the basis of article 138, paragraph 3, of the Treaty setting up the European Economic Community, on the basis of a project drawn up by the European Parliament, which made no mention of the particular situation of Gibraltar."
"Nor would the Council be able to extend, by its wish alone, the application of the 1993 directive on the exercising of voting rights and eligibility for the European Parliament, which refers to the 1976 Act, to enable the citizens of the United Kingdom resident in Gibraltar to vote in European parliamentary elections in a Member State where, hypothetically, they do not reside."
"Indeed, the 1993 directive is based on article 8b, paragraph 2, of the Treaty, whose application is limited to European Union citizens resident in a Member State of which they are not nationals only."
"Mr President, the fact is that I have received the proposal for a law concerning a voting right for Gibraltar from the British House of Commons, but only after I put this question - I did not know about it before."
"I have heard that it is not the first proposal."
"Other proposals have already been rejected."
"But here there was the opinion that this proposal of 1July of this year had a better chance."
"I do not know how that can be combined with that."
"Furthermore, the legal situation - looking at Gibraltar today - is rather divided, if you take on one side the Peñón and on the other the isthmus, because the Peñón practically belongs to England according to the Treaty of Utrecht, whereas in the case of the isthmus there is some dispute about who it belongs to, even if it is now quite clearly under British administration."
"Mr President, the clever people sitting to my left and behind me are of the opinion that I should not burden the last days of the Luxembourg Presidency by now getting mixed up in the difficulties between two Member States."
"I think this was clever advice!"
"So I would like to tell you that I understand your question very well, but I will give you my answer outside the door."
"As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses."
"Question No 8 by John Cushnahan (H-0878/97)"
"Subject: European Food Agency"
"Can the Luxembourg Presidency inform me whether the Council is prepared to give its support to the Commission's proposal to establish a European Food Agency?"
"I am sorry to have to say that the Commission has currently submitted no proposal to the Council regarding the creation of a European Food Agency."
"As soon as it has been submitted, it goes without saying that the Council will as quickly as possible proceed to examine the text in depth and when the time comes will take a decision in full knowledge of the reason and by virtue of the Commission's proposal's own merits."
"Mr President, thank you for your courtesy in allowing me to ask a question."
"I do appreciate that I arrived just as you were moving on and I also thank Mr Juncker for his answer."
"I have taken note of what you said regarding the Commission proposal."
"I understood that it was before the Council."
"I will check that but can I ask (and I do not expect you to give a formal answer) whether - maybe when it does come before the Council - the Luxembourg Government will support such a proposal and whether maybe it is something, as you go out of your presidency, that you will pressurize the next presidency about?"
"Can I congratulate you on a successful presidency?"
"You certainly moved the European agenda forward."
"I repeat that it is the Luxembourg government's custom to study Commission proposals before being able to support them."
"Our support is not a support in principle."
"We only take a decision after having read and examined the proposal."
"Question No 9 by Carlos Robles Piquer (H-0882/97)"
"Subject: Request by thousands of Cuban citizens for a plebiscite"
"More than ten thousand clearly identified Cuban citizens resident in Cuba have now signed a letter addressed to the President of the National Assembly of People's Power of the Republic of Cuba respectfully requesting, in accordance with article 88(g) of the 1976 Constitution, that a plebiscite be held to consult the people on whether they wish to amend the Constitution to the effect that it would guarantee freedom of expression, freedom of association, pluralism and the election of the government through a direct, free and secret ballot."
"According to Amnesty International (AMR 25/29/97/S) the first 12 signatories were visited by the police, who warned them that they were risking long prison sentences."
"What information can the Council provide on this initiative, the Cuban Government's response and the likelihood, in its view, that a petition lodged in accordance with the Cuban Constitution might be accepted and acted on?"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"The information I have is not entirely consistent with yours."
"I believe at least one of the two initiatives has already exceeded the figure of 10, 000 signatures, by means of worthy effort and great personal risk."
"However, even if it has not yet reached that number, there is no doubt that it will do so reasonably soon."
"So, my supplementary question is whether, despite the awful wording of that terrible article 62 which has been read to us and which is, of course, a proclamation of absolute totalitarianism, there is anything the Council can do to try to persuade the Cuban authorities simply to comply with their own constitution, which they themselves - Fidel Castro - approved."
"I believe that once that figure of 10, 000 signatures has been reached - and as I said, if that has not yet happened then it soon will - there will have to be some effort, on the part of the Council and the official embassies there, to persuade the Cuban Government to comply with its own constitution."
"I do not doubt that the Council will be able to act in the way indicated by the honourable gentleman."
"Mr President, thank you for your clear statement."
"We have not always heard such clear statements in this Chamber on this subject, and I also thank you for what the Council has defined not long ago as the common attitude on this question."
"But I wanted to ask additionally, what about efforts to form treaty relationships with Cuba - even membership of the ACP has been mentioned - and what part is played by questions of human rights and freedom of belief and conscience in this context."
"Thank you, Mr Posselt."
"I am sure you realize that your supplementary question is well outside the scope of Mr Robles Piquer's original question."
"Therefore, it is up to Mr Juncker whether he replies or not."
"Mr Juncker, the floor is yours, to use as you see fit."
"Mr President, the Council defined its Cuba policy in the common statement of 2 December 1996."
"The questions which you have raised will have to be answered in the context of the implementation of what was said there."
"Question No 10 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0887/97)"
"Subject: Abolition of the teaching of ancient Greek in France"
"According to information from the French Association of Language Teachers, the National Union of Secondary School Teachers and the Toulouse Regional Classics Teaching Association, moves are being made by the French Minister of Education, Claude Allegre, to abolish the teaching of ancient Greek as part of the educational reforms scheduled for the beginning of 1998."
"Ancient Greek is currently taught to 1.9 % of pupils in certain secondary school classes while Latin is taught to 25.4 %."
"Despite reassurances from the Minister of Education, these rumours are still giving cause for concern."
"While educational curricula are the responsibility of the Member States, action to improve the teaching of European languages is one of the priorities of the European Union."
"What representations will the Council of Ministers make to the French Government, which is itself engaged in an intense campaign ( ""Francophonie' ) in favour of the French language in other countries?"
"As Mr Alavanos states, responsibility for the content of education and the organization of an education system remain within the jurisdiction of Member States."
"In accordance with the relevant article of the treaty, the Community contributes to the development of a quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and completing their actions, whilst fully respecting their responsibilities."
"Furthermore article 126 of the treaty states, in paragraph 2, that Community action aims at developing the European dimension in education, in particular by apprenticeships and the diffusion of the languages of the Member States."
"It should be noted that this relates to the spoken languages of the Member States and not dead languages."
"In the absence of a Commission proposal, the Council would not be able to adopt the actions of encouragement in this area that the honourable gentleman has mentioned."
"It is furthermore not for the Council to intervene in the content and organization of the education system of a Member State."
"I consequently fear that the Council is hardly in a position to undertake any step that may be contrary to the French government regarding the teaching of ancient Greek in French schools."
"Mr President, I would like to thank President Juncker for his reply."
"It is a reply within his terms of reference."
"I would however like to ask him the following question: does he not believe that ancient, perhaps unspoken, languages such as ancient Greek or Latin, are part of the heritage of the European Union that we are in the process of constructing?"
"Is our heritage simply what is to be found in museums or in certain buildings?"
"Is not part of our cultural tradition just these languages, which play a fundamental role in European culture today?"
"Does he not think that they should be supported throughout Europe?"
"How does he react to the Greek proposal for the creation of a Centre of Classical Studies in the European Union?"
"I await the replies of the President with great interest."
"Having spent seven years of my life studying Latin, I would like to believe that the teaching of dead languages enables a better comprehension of the integrality of European cultural heritage."
"Question No 11 by Bernd Posselt (H-0890/97)"
"Subject: Autonomous status for Kosovo"
"What steps has the Luxembourg Presidency taken to reinstate Kosovo's autonomous status, which was unlawfully withdrawn in 1988?"
"The oppression of Kosovo's Albanian majority, which accounts for 90 % of the population, must under no circumstances be trivialized and dismissed as a ""minority problem' ."
"Is the Council considering sending international observers, or even peace-keeping forces, to Kosovo, and what means are being used to exert pressure on Belgrade so that it finally agrees to the opening of a European Union office in Prishtina, particularly in view of the fact that the United States has had such an office for a long time?"
"The Council continues to give a high priority to the problem of Kosovo."
"In its declaration of 9 April 1996 on recognition, by Member States of the European Union, of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the European Union declared that from then on the development of good relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the place of this country within the international community would depend on the adoption by the FRY of a constructive attitude, in particular with regard to the full respect for human rights, rights of minorities and the right of return for all refugees or displaced people as well as the granting to Kosovo of a large degree of autonomy within the FRY."
"The position that I have just stated has been repeated many times, in particular by the European Council at its meetings of 13 and 14 December 1996 in Dublin, 16 and 17 June 1997 at Amsterdam, as well as by the Council on 29 April 1997 and, more recently, in its declaration of 10 November of this year aimed at the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"In particular in its conclusions of 29 April 1997, on the application of conditionality for relations between the European Union and the countries of the region, the Council linked the development of relations between the European Union and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to conditions both general and specific."
"Thus, general assistance within the Phare programme requires that the FRY makes a credible offer with a view to initiating real dialogue on the status of Kosovo."
"The opening of possible negotiations regarding a possible cooperation agreement will depend in particular on the existence of real dialogue with the Albanians of Kosovo on the status of Kosovo, within the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"One of the conditions for the conclusion of a cooperation agreement is the effective granting of a large degree of autonomy to Kosovo."
"Furthermore, the Council has underlined, in particular during its session of 6 October 1997, that the commencement of dialogue between the Belgrade authorities and the Kosovo Albanians is necessary and that all the parties concerned must contribute to this fully and rapidly."
"It even insisted on the implementation of the education agreement concluded between Mr Milosevic and Mr Rugova without delay."
"The European Union has indicated its intention to support this agreement."
"The European Union is asking the Belgrade authorities to allow recourse in the long term to missions of the OSC to Kosovo, Vojvodine and Sandjak and it continues to follow the situation closely, in particular through the ECMM."
"To the same end, the European Union intends to open an office in Pristina and it has presented a proposal to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"As you know, no resolution of the UN's Security Council has anticipated a peace maintenance force for Kosovo in particular."
"Mr President, the problem in Kosovo is simply that because of years of neglect by the international community - by which I do not mean the Luxembourg Council Presidency, which has actually done something - a situation has arisen in which everything threatens to escalate and outbreaks of violence are expected."
"Therefore, we must really try, before it is too late, to bring about a political solution, even by pressure."
"The Americans have an office in Pristina, and the European Union has been talking about it for years and has no office in Pristina."
"The same obviously applies to autonomy."
"The autonomy of Kosovo was a constituent part of the constitution of Yugoslavia before it broke up."
"We must press for the restoration of this autonomy."
"I believe that the attitude which Yugoslavia took at the Petersberg conference in Bonn, that this is an internal affair of Yugoslavia, cannot be accepted simply because we know that there are hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and refugees from Kosovo in the territory of the EU."
"My question is therefore: Are further steps planned?"
"Mr President, I assume that the British Presidency will continue the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency in this direction."
"Question No 12 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0894/97)"
"Subject: Supervision of the Schengen Information System register"
"Does the Council of Ministers consider that the Joint Supervisory Authority (JSA), the authority intended to supervise the correct operation of the SIS register, has adequate resources and powers to carry out its work in a satisfactory manner?"
"Does the Council intend to make any changes to the JSA's modus operandi if and when the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into EU law?"
"Will the supervision of the register within the Schengen Agreement and Europol be carried out by separate authorities even if the Schengen Agreement becomes part of EU law?"
"The Joint Supervisory Authority was set up by the convention for the purpose of implementing Schengen, more precisely by its article 115."
"The JSA is part of the Schengen patrimony."
"The Council, at this stage, is not in a position to give an opinion on the functioning of the JSA which comes within the jurisdiction of the Schengen authorities."
"The creation of a Joint Supervisory Authority for Europol is anticipated in article 24, paragraph 7 of the convention which set up Europol."
"Since January 1996, work has begun in order to draw up its internal regulations, in particular in the light of the work of the European data commissioners."
"It is anticipated that the work on a draft text of internal regulations will be finished in the first months of next year."
"It is not anticipated at this stage that one supervisory authority alone will cover the SIS and Europol."
"Thank you for your reply to the question, and the answer that there are no plans for a joint supervisory authority in connection with Europol."
"I think it is important to study the example of the JSA in order to see what problems could be encountered in the case of Europol."
"I hold in my hand the first activity report from the authority which is supposed to supervise personal security in the Schengen Information System."
"I must say, it makes catastrophic reading."
"Among other things the authority has such limited resources that no real inspection can be carried out. For example, it has no offices."
"In addition, the authority has been denied access to the central computer located in Schengen in order to be able to carry out the inspection it wants to do."
"When some inspecting was done, it was found that there is different information about the same persons in different parts of the Schengen Information System, that it is difficult to find out who has had access to the Information System and has looked for various sensitive pieces of information, that those who have been registered, such as asylum seekers, do not know how to find out whether the information is correct, and that certain Member States use the information in an incorrect way."
"A lesson must now be learned from this."
"What are we considering doing in the case of Europol so that this is not repeated?"
"What are we considering doing about this when the Schengen Agreement becomes part of EC law?"
"We believe that this issue will develop in the short term and, when the time comes, the Council will have the possibility of giving the European Parliament all useful information enabling it in particular to exercise, within the limits imposed by the Treaty, its role in the supervision of Community action in this area."
"Question No 13 by Maren Günther (H-0896/97)"
"Subject: Image of the various European countries in the other EU Member States"
"A negative, superficial and simplistic image of other countries is often conveyed in EU Member States, especially in certain media."
"Prompt measures should be taken in schools to counter this tendency."
"What steps are being taken to ensure that as objective an image as possible of the various European countries is conveyed in the other Member States?"
"Are efforts being made in joint bodies (e.g. school book commissions) to reduce prejudice about European neighbours?"
"The Council has for a long time been sensitive to the concerns mentioned."
"Indeed, in its resolution of 1976 which comprised a programme of action in the area of education, one of the important themes of the text was made up of what we at the time called the best opportunities for cultural and professional training for nationals of other Member States of the Community and of non-member countries and their children."
"Point 2 of this chapter initiated, amongst other things, studies and works of pedagogic research into the place and importance of the culture of the mother tongue of nationals from other Member States in school programmes."
"Since then the Council has continued to give concrete signs of its interest in this issue, whilst acting within a wider perspective than that following from the question."
"Thus, through its conclusions of 27 September 1985, the Council introduced the concept of the European dimension into education."
"Apart from the promotion of the teaching of foreign languages, its conclusions indicate, as an appropriate measure, the promotion of measures aimed at encouraging contact between pupils of different countries and the development of a European dimension in study programmes, in training and in educational materials."
"In the Council resolution of 24 May 1988 on the European dimension of education, the objectives include the need to improve young people's knowledge of historical, cultural, economic, and social aspects of the Community and of its Member States and to make them understand the interest in cooperation of the European Community with other countries of Europe and the world."
"In its conclusions of 27 November 1992 on the measures aimed at developing the European dimension in higher education, the Council confirms, in particular, that, to take up the challenge of an increase in the number of students having access to the European dimension, we must now strengthen the integration of this dimension in the policy and the practise of higher education at all levels."
"All of this underlines the concrete interest in anchoring the concept of the European dimension in the different educational systems."
"It is due to this integration that it should be progressively possible to wipe out the current bad perceptions to which you have referred."
"With regard to the specific initiatives referred to, these can only be taken on the basis of proposals in due form from the Commission."
"Mr President-in-Office, thank you for the answer."
"A short question: Are you satisfied with the results of all these efforts over the decades, as far as the image of the states - above all in the media - is concerned?"
"I am thinking particularly of criticism in the media, in which individual countries are really branded, particularly by young people."
"No, Mrs Günther, I am not at all satisfied with what has been achieved!"
"Question No 14 by Alex Smith (H-0903/97)"
"Subject: Community policy towards climate change and the use of nuclear fuels"
"During the most recent Troika discussions on Community policy towards climate change, was there any consideration of the proposals advanced by the European nuclear industry to increase the use of plutonium-uranium mixed oxide (MOX) nuclear fuels in reactors as part of a strategy to reduce CO emission from electricity generation?"
"The Council is not aware of the proposals formulated by the European nuclear industry to which the honourable gentleman refers in his question."
"In any case, I can indicate to you that, in principle, the Council would give all its attention to proposals which may be submitted to it with a view to reducing the greenhouse effect."
"It goes without saying that the Council will examine these proposals according to their own merits and without prior assumptions of any kind."
"I would lastly like to underline the fact that the Community strategy, with a view to the third conference of contracting parties to the framework convention of the United Nations on climatic change, which took place in Kyoto, has been recorded in the Council conclusions of 16th October 1997."
"They are available to Parliament."
"Mr President, I am indeed grateful to hear the Council say that it would discuss this with no a priori considerations because there is a downside to the use of MOX fuel."
"A report recently issued after a two-year project makes it quite clear that it has a potential for terrorist organizations in the fabrication of nuclear devices with socalled reactor-grade plutonium, the stuff that is being produced at Sellafield and La Hague."
"It is made chillingly clear how dangerous this is and obviously the transportation of nuclear fuel is equally dangerous."
"Would the Council please obtain a copy of this report and study its implications?"
"It is called ""The comprehensive social impact assessment of MOX use in light water reactors' ."
"I would like to repeat that at this current time the Commission has not submitted a proposal to the Council with regard to this."
"Once such a proposal is made, we will give it all the attention which an examination of this question requires."
"Question No 15 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H-0911/97)"
"Subject: Provocative letter from the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Cem"
"On 20 October 1997 the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Cem, addressed a letter to the Foreign Ministers of all EU Member States which not only contains a large number of inaccuracies and allegations against Greece, but also basically threatens the EU with war in Cyprus if this country goes ahead with plans to station the S-300 missile defence system in areas still untouched by Turkish rapacity."
"The same letter provocatively states that, even if negotiations are initiated with Turkey concerning EU accession, the problem of Cyprus will still not be solved."
"Will the Council give its official view on this matter, given that Turkey is pursuing its attacks with undiminished vigour against the EU, a Member State (Greece) and Cyprus and denying the latter country the right to accede to the Union and to protect itself from unrelenting Turkish expansionism?"
"I have spoken about this issue three times today. Consequently, I will refer the author of this question to the three replies I gave during the course of today's debates."
"Mr Juncker, indeed you are right since the question was tabled before the Luxembourg session, and is therefore somewhat out-of-date."
"This morning I have listened to the whole of the debate and to your replies, but I wish to avail myself of the opportunity to ask you if have heard about the interview given just two hours ago in Brussels by Mr Gilmaz, who said that he is giving the European Union six months' grace to revise its position, otherwise Turkey will revise its own position in respect of customs union."
"Secondly, if you have heard of yesterday's statement by Mr Denktash in Brussels, who asked the representative of the Commission in northern Cyprus to leave northern Cyprus since, as he said, he was bothering them."
"I would like his initial comment on the above two issues."
"As for my basic question, thank you, it has been covered."
"I do not wish to comment on the opinions given by the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs at a press conference in Brussels, as I am not in possession of the precise text of the minister's speech."
"Unlike the Turkish Prime Minister and the Turkish government, I would first of all like to read what the Turkish government said before commenting on the content."
"I would have preferred that the Turkish government had first of all read the European Union's offer before rejecting it."
"I am concerned about precisely the same thing."
"I have just been in touch with our Foreign Minister in Sweden who has spoken about what has emerged today."
"Turkey is going to withdraw its application for full EU membership if the EU does not include Turkey on the list of applicant countries by June next year at the latest. There is a quite threatening tone in that if it is true - I only got the information via telephone and radio."
"It is still a serious matter and highly worrying since I and many others do not consider that Turkey is fulfilling the requirements of the Customs Union Agreement."
"A war is taking place in Kurdistan, there is continuous torture and there is no guarantee of human rights in the country."
"It is of course impossible for you to comment on what has been said today, but it is very urgent for us to now ensure that no conflict arises on the basis of the latest information."
"I would like to have a comment from you on that."
"You must understand that I would first of all like to be fully aware of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affair's comments before being able to comment on them myself."
"Question No 16 by Pat Gallagher (H-0913/97)"
"Subject: Protest march in Brussels"
"Can the President of the Council indicate whether the Council is prepared to re-examine the duty-free issue in the light of recent political developments such as public declarations from the Irish, Greek, Spanish, Finnish and German Governments that the issue should be reopened and, in the light of the 15, 000 workers who participated in a protest march outside the Council, Commission and the European Parliament buildings in Brussels on Monday 1 December to voice their concerns over the abolition of duty-free in June 1999?"
"To reply to this question I will say that the maintenance of dutyfree sales for travel within the Community is in contradiction with the existence of an internal market without borders."
"Indeed, the circulation between two Member States of goods bought by individuals for their personal use is of no more consequence from the point of view of tax law."
"Thus, individuals can buy goods for personal use in any other Member State without having to declare them or pay tax at the border."
"In this situation, the application of exemptions for travellers beyond the deadlines anticipated could create distortions in competition for businesses selling goods with tax included, as well as between the different forms of transport, depending on whether they propose to sell duty-free or not."
"If the Council has temporarily extended duty-free sales to intracommunity travellers until 30 June 1999, it was to alleviate the social and regional difficulties which risk being caused by a too sudden abolition of these sales."
"Thus, it was a question of giving sufficient time to the sector concerned to prepare itself for the disappearance of intracommunity duty-free sales."
"Furthermore, it should be noted that even in the absence of the aforementioned tax advantage, opportunities for sale will probably remain."
"Regarding duty-free sales, these will continue to exist for travellers from third countries, due to the very fact of exports."
"While I welcome the reply, which seems to be somewhat factual in relation to the decisions taken, what can he say to the Irish, Greek, Spanish, Finnish and German Governments which, we understand, are anxious that there should be a further extension?"
"He refers to the single market."
"Surely he is referring to a pure single market."
"I am sure there is a lot of other harmonization that could take place."
"I also welcome his initiative in relation to the employment summit."
"I should like to say to the President that these jobs which could be lost could be sustained if the Council took this very courageous decision to allow duty-free to continue for a further period."
"Does he also accept that to suggest that it should not continue beyond June 1999 flies in the face of the wishes of the vast majority of Europeans?"
"The Commission gave an assurance to this institution that an economic and social study would be carried out."
"That assurance was given in 1991."
"So much for the respect that the Commission has for this House."
"What does the Council intend doing about that?"
"How, therefore, can the Commission suggest that Community instruments and state aid could be used in the event of jobs being in jeopardy if it does not carry out this study?"
"Mr President-in-Office, I suggest that, in the final weeks of your office, you ask the Commission to fulfil the commitment to this House and until such time as it can do that - present the recommendations of a study - that it should allow this duty-free to continue."
"We have asked the Commission to provide us with this study."
"When the Commission has made a proposal for a directive on this point, we will need to be unanimous to be able to amend the directive currently in force, which the Member States agreed on until 30 June 1999."
"In the absence of an initiative from the Commission we cannot act and, assuming they take such an initiative, I am not certain that we would be able to achieve the necessary unanimity to be able to amend the current directive, which stands until the end of June 1999."
"I congratulate the President-in-Office on his firmness."
"He will be aware that the Court of Justice delivered a judgment early in November which clearly stated that the Commission and the Council had proceeded correctly in this matter and that the European Parliament had been duly consulted."
"He will also be aware that there is a great deal of misleading publicity and scaremongering on the part of what is generally referred to as the dutyfree lobby."
"One example is the figure of 16, 000 quoted here, which is a wild exaggeration."
"It was reported to me at lunchtime by a representative of the duty-free lobby that there were at the most 6, 000 people there."
"I saw a small demonstration outside the European Parliament that I would put at no more than 300."
"So, my question is: Will the Council please stick to its guns on this and encourage the British presidency to do the same?"
"During the past few months, each time the Council discussed this question, I never had the impression that we were in a position to unanimously delay the measures anticipated to come into force on 30 June 1999."
"Consequently, I do not think that the British government has need of particular encouragement in this respect."
"Mr President, whichever way you look at it, it seems that there is great unrest in a number of regions and a number of sectors."
"I refer to ferries, to regional airports, to tourism in peripheral regions."
"Did I gather correctly from the answer of the President-in-Office of the Council that he also thinks that in 1997 people have a right to know what the probable consequences will be when this measure, as decided, takes effect on 1 July 1999?"
"Is he prepared to have another talk with the Commission to ensure that this study will indeed be carried out in the short term, so that there will be clarity on the social and regional implications we have to draw from it?"
"Could I have an answer on this from the President-in-Office of the Council?"
"We have invited the Commission to produce a study for us, which many of you are referring to."
"It is true that all of these issues should have been discussed at the time the Council took its decision."
"This was in 1991, at the Ecofin Council."
"I believe, furthermore, that I was President of the Council."
"Since then I have seen some colleagues move into opposition and ask for the revision of the directive, only to return to office and become very quiet on the subject."
"Consequently, unanimity will be necessary to amend this directive."
"It does not exist because governments have very different opinions on this issue."
"It is true that the Council is not organized along the same lines of systematic persuasion as the duty-free lobby."
"I admire the efforts put into this problem by those who are particularly affected."
"If Europe had the same competence and the same capacity for marketing as the lobbies in question, we would perhaps be able to explain why we took the decision that we did in 1991."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 lapse."
"Question No 22 by Brian Crowley (H-0932/97)"
"Subject: EU and a global traffic safety effort"
"According to a report just released by the World Health Organization and the Harvard School of Public Health, road accidents are set to become the third biggest cause of premature death and disability across the world by 2020."
"Does the Council have a position on this alarming forecast, and does it share the view of the US Transportation Secretary that a global traffic safety effort is needed and, if it does agree, what contribution can the EU and the individual Member States make to this effort?"
"The Council shares the honourable gentleman's concerns regarding the harmful consequences of road traffic accidents on life and human health."
"This is why the criteria for road safety, appearing in article 75, paragraph 1, letter c of the treaty inspires all the Council's actions, in particular all the legislative acts that it adopts in the area of transport."
"In addition, the Council expressed a unanimous opinion on this question in its conclusions adopted during the session of 17 June of this year."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his very short and curt reply."
"However, the question was: What contribution the President-in-Office thought that we in the EU and he could make with regard to this global transportation safety question?"
"In particular, there are two areas on which I thought you might have responded."
"Firstly, there is our duty of care for the health and protection of EU citizens."
"Secondly, there are various considerations regarding the different directives which have gone through Parliament, the Council and Commission in the recent past with regard to design and models; some thought might also be given to standardizing safety features within the automobile sector to ensure they are made available, not necessarily as extras but also as part of the normal construction of automobiles to guarantee the safety not only of the drivers but also of the passengers and pedestrians."
"At the current time, the Commission has submitted no proposal to the Council regarding the problems mentioned by the honourable gentleman."
"I would nevertheless like to add, on a personal level, that I consider that the European Union should pay more direct attention to these problems, which concern the daily life of many men and women in Europe."
"It is a question of putting into concrete practice within Europe these formal, rhetorical, lively discussions."
"A Europe of citizens exists, day after day, on our roads, and I think that much could be done, if only to harmonize all the signs and instructions, all the illustrated warnings, which add nothing to the richness of Europe but which make life difficult for European citizens when they travel."
"I believe that we show a serious deficit in the area of road safety."
"The fault, of course, lies with Member States, with the Commission and with Parliament, with all those in fact, who have failed to provide Europe with a strategy in this area, which would make Europe more attractive and more popular in the eyes of its citizens."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 23 and 24 fall."
"That concludes Question Time."
"However, I should like to offer our sincere thanks once again to Mr Juncker, the President-in-Office of the Council, for being here with us today, and for his answers, and for working with Parliament."
"We wish him all the best for Christmas and the New Year."
"And we request him to convey to Mr Wohlfart our best wishes for his speedy recovery, and our hopes that he will be well enough to enjoy Christmas."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Investment firms and credit institutions (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0380/97) by Mr Cassidy, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 93/6/EEC on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (COM(97)0071 - C4-0304/97-97/0124(COD))"
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Cassidy for his excellent presentation of the nuances of this complicated issue."
"It is important for the people of Europe, even if they may not readily understand that because it is about underpinning the financial solvency of institutions."
"It is an amendment to the CAD I directive."
"I would also like to thank our colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who have worked so hard in reaching what I think is a sensible practical compromise and Mr Katiforis who has brought a lot of detailed technical knowledge from the Economic and Monetary Committee to this debate."
"I am not going to go over what Mr Cassidy said because he explained it so lucidly."
"I just want to flag up the importance of Amendments Nos 16, 19 and 20."
"In particular, with Amendment No 20, trying to bring in a differentiation between different types of commodities, what is known as the expanded matrix."
"To me it seems quite self-evident that the treatment of metals should be different from the treatment of perishables like coffee, cocoa, sugar etc. and the expanded matrix is simply trying to make sense of the need to treat things like tin, copper, silver differently from commodities like cocoa and coffee."
"Fortunately we have been able to explain this adequately in the Council of Ministers and in this Parliament and I think now it is accepted that the expanded matrix is sensible."
"So I sincerely hope that the vote will go successfully in the Parliament tomorrow."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"My group welcomes the Commission's proposal to introduce a more stringent and effective method of measuring banks' and investment firms' capital requirements, and one geared towards market risk."
"This involves adopting the Basle rules on banking supervision, with a view in particular to avoiding distortions in competition relating to competition from outside Europe."
"Therefore, like the previous speaker and the rapporteur himself, I would particularly ask you to support the three amendments tabled by my group, i.e. Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 16, which correspond to the old Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 8."
"These concern the transitional period up to 31 December 2006."
"The institutions affected require this transition period to adapt to the new rules, and it is needed above all to achieve a uniform deadline for all three banking supervision directives."
"This means that Amendment No 20 is important."
"Internal risk models are not yet sufficiently developed for banking supervision purposes, and the banks must be allowed to continue working with the extended maturity bank models up to the end of the transitional period."
"I would also ask you to support Amendment No 16."
"This amendment is concerned with a method for internal risk models that do not satisfy the criteria listed in paragraph 4 of Annex 8."
"All these amendments reflect the Basle Rules."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the committee responsible and, in particular, its rapporteur Mr Cassidy for their excellent work on this highly technical proposal."
"I am most grateful for the speed with which they have been able to process the proposal, given the importance of its early adoption for Europe's financial services industry."
"The proposal represents a major step in improving the assessment of market risk for capital adequacy purposes."
"Not only will this improve the prudential soundness of our financial institutions but it will also contribute to their competitiveness by helping to optimize the allocation of capital within them."
"The Commission believes this reflects our common purpose to promote a safe and competitive financial sector in an environment of constant innovation and technological change."
"Our proposal introduces into EU legislation recent developments in the international supervisory community regarding the use by institutions of their own statistical models to set supervisory capital requirements and inclusion of commodity positions in those requirements."
"A number of amendments have been proposed, largely reflecting further relevant decisions taken in international regulatory fora since the adoption of our proposal."
"We welcome these amendments."
"However, we are concerned that some other very technical amendments are not fully consistent with the approach adopted at international level."
"These we oppose."
"Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 and 17 introduce useful technical clarifications which we welcome."
"However, Amendment No 4 duplicates much of Amendment No 2."
"We would prefer to draw on the latter for our amended proposal."
"Amendments Nos 15 and 17 duplicate Amendments Nos 5 and 6, third paragraph."
"We could accept both and will make a proposal covering the substance of these amendments."
"Amendment No 1, on the other hand, introduces a new capital charge for recently issued securities which diverge from the international approach adopted by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision."
"This would create an uneven regulatory playing field between the European Union and other G10 institutions."
"We fear it may also be prejudicial in certain circumstances."
"It means it could impair the success of the market introduction of shares of new companies or of privatizations such as France Telecom and Halifax by imposing an 8 % charge on securities which currently attract only a 2 % charge as highly liquid instruments."
"I would therefore recommend that you oppose this amendment."
"Amendments Nos 9 and 10 also prescribe a degree of detail regarding the elements of risk to be covered by internal models which would impair the ability of the authorities to adapt the requirements appropriately to individual circumstances."
"Such adaptability is the intention of the changes at international level."
"It could also result in certain elements of risk being ignored because they are not specifically mentioned."
"Our original proposal deliberately employs forms of wording which would ensure that all material risks are covered without trying to prejudge the precise requirements to be observed in every situation."
"We believe that this should be left for the competent authority to judge on the basis of each individual case."
"On these grounds I would encourage you to support the original wording of the proposal and reject Amendments Nos 9 and 10."
"Finally, a number of additional amendments have been tabled."
"Two of them - Nos 19 and 20 - relate to transitional arrangements for the treatment of commodities."
"This has been one of the most difficult elements of the proposal."
"The models approach requires specialized computer software and highly qualified technical staff to operate it properly."
"Not only will this be very expensive for small and medium-sized investment firms but also, as you know, the euro conversion and the millennium problem are already absorbing many of these resources."
"Certain institutions will therefore need time to adjust to the new capital regime for commodities."
"The proposed transitional period until the year 2006 during which the authorities may apply an alternative set of capital charges for commodities represents a very sound compromise between the need to establish a common set of requirements for commodities business and the interests of individual institutions which would suffer unduly from an abrupt introduction of the new requirements."
"I would strongly encourage you to support these amendments."
"Another of the additional amendments, No 16, clarifies that the original standardized method should be used for calculating capital requirements in cases where models do not satisfy the necessary criteria for measuring specific risk."
"I consider this to be a helpful clarification."
"Thank you, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Olives and olive oil"
"The next item is the report (A4-0374/97) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Note to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament on the olive and olive oil sector (including economic, cultural, regional, social and environmental aspects), the current common market organization, the need for a reform and the alternatives envisaged - Options Paper (COM(97)0057) - C4-0096/97)"
"Madam President, in the first place I would like to thank the Commission for having followed the recommendation contained in the resolution approved by us in October 1996 and for having produced the document which is the subject of this report."
"However, the lack of information in the report about the operation of aid in the olive oil sector is to be regretted, in spite of the fact that it was requested by Decision 2261/84 of the Council and should have been presented before January 1995."
"The memorandum produced by the Commission does not meet the Council's requirements, and this deficiency has made discussion and the production of the report more difficult."
"The Commission's memorandum highlights weaknesses in the analysis of the sector and, to rectify them, I made a request for complementary information which was not fully answered in the letter which the Commissioner sent me at the end of July."
"One of the problems in the analysis is the pessimistic picture which is drawn in regard to the sector's position and, above all, about a possible risk of future surpluses."
"This is not the case."
"The last harvest was exceptional and reached levels which are considered dangerous according to the Commission's memorandum."
"However, at the end of the season there were hardly any stocks registered in the control system."
"To have this pessimistic view, the Commission rejects its own research and uses other sources from the International Oleicola Council in which the influence of third countries, who would benefit from a reduction in the possible Community production, cannot be ignored."
"As far as the options are concerned, the Committee on Agriculture has clearly played down the option of aid not linked to production - this was the meaning of the vote taken in the Committee on Agriculture at the European Parliament."
"The fundamental reason is of a social nature, due to the higher risks in the loss of employment which would show up in the Community regions most affected by unemployment."
"If unlinked aid, following the direction of the 1992 reform, is proposed you cannot ignore the fact that between 1990 and 1995 13 % of the Community agribusinesses and 23 % of agricultural work has disappeared, according to the survey on the structure of agribusinesses. These are facts that the Commission cannot ignore."
"If these effects have come about after the 1992 reform, the effects of destroying work in the olive growing sector would be much greater for two reasons."
"Firstly, olive cultivation involves intensive manual labour."
"The cost of gathering the olives is made up of 80 % of the expenses of manual labour and 70 % of the variable costs."
"Consequently, if aid is not linked to production, the risks of destroying employment would be more than obvious."
"In addition, the reduced level of cultivation costs made when the aid was given - 15 % as opposed to 85 % for cereals or 98 % for bulls - considerably increases the risks of destroying employment."
"These sorts of risk are contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty in respect to employment."
"These risks would have an effect in the regions where the rate of unemployment is double the Community average, and which, moreover, show important cohesion problems."
"It is unreasonable to increase cohesion problems or the need for a possible rural development policy which, at this time, is no more than an abstract formula."
"Does the Commission intend to run the risk of carrying out dangerous experiments with a problem as serious as employment?"
"Defenders of unlinked aid argue that control is easier with such aid."
"However, the Committee, in describing the control system applicable in the case of introducing aid per tree, restricts itself to quoting a Geographical Information System. I do not think it is appropriate to let ourselves be dazzled by technological wizardry."
"Although the technical benefits of satellites would be an improvement, they would never manage to drop aid on each olive tree."
"A formidable administrative framework would always be necessary to distribute the aid corresponding to each tree among more than two million producers."
"These two million producers are usually found in areas of continuous cultivation and there would appear to be enormous difficulties for the distribution of aid."
"If we are trying to differentiate aid as a function of returns we face the lack of consistent regulation in the producing Member States and this matter has raised fierce debates which have had to be settled by the Court of Justice."
"If proof of changing the olive into oil were demanded the control system should be reasonably similar to the current one with the added cost for satellite pictures."
"Therefore it would be reasonable to make the current system perfect."
"It is clear that in this debate the producers of olives are in opposition to the aid collectors."
"Between these two positions a great number of jobs are put at risk in those regions with most unemployment in the Community, which show serious cohesion problems and whose economies are highly dependent on the levels of olive oil production."
"Madam President, I conclude: above all allow me to congratulate and express my personal gratitude to all my colleagues in the committee from the various countries who were determined to achieve a common solution in looking for a unitary position to reflect a single voice, a voice from this millenial culture, firmly based in the Mediterranean as well as in European culture."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please excuse me if I have to be very firm about speaking time."
"We still have a great many reports on the agenda and a good many speakers, so we will not finish by midnight otherwise."
"I would therefore ask you to stick to the agreed speaking times without me having to remind you every time."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and I would also like to express my satisfaction that Mr Jové Peres has included in his report all of the conclusions that were unanimously approved by the Committee on Employment."
"Madam President, the production of olive products is concentrated in the countries of the Mediterranean and in particular the objective 1 regions, which are structurally weak and where the per capita income is less than 75 % of the Community average."
"In these regions the percentage of the workforce employed in agriculture is especially high, and the unemployment rate is about three times the Community average."
"The olive oil sector is the most important economic sector and approximately 27 % of jobs are directly or indirectly linked with olive oil production, which demonstrates its importance in the wider social balance and cohesion of these regions."
"Therefore there are obvious dangers for the socio-economic fabric of these regions in disturbing these balances through a policy that threatens to hit olive cultivation."
"The greatest weakness of the Commission communication is that it lacked a thorough analysis in respect of the repercussions that the proposed revision of the COM would have on employment."
"The Committee on Employment is deeply worried about the implementation of aid per tree, which may have catastrophic repercussions on employment in the sector."
"There is the fear that olive oil producers will lose interest in the quality of the product and in improving it, and that they will be unconcerned with quantity or will abandon olive cultivation for good, resulting in a significant loss of jobs and incomes."
"Our fear is that there will be significant repercussions on the entire product chain: oil-pressing; standardisation units; trade, creating serious economic and social problems and exacerbating the phenomenon of the desertification of the countryside."
"The Committee on Employment calls on the European Commission to act in accordance with the recommendations in paragraphs 7.5, 11, 14, 15 and 16 of the report, which incorporate its conclusions in full, and for this reason it once again thanks the rapporteur."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, I would like, in the first place, to congratulate Mr Jové Peres on his magnificent report since he is a person who is aware of what olive plantation and olive cultivation mean to his native people."
"Commissioner, we are absolutely opposed to fraud and we understand that fraud must not be any form of subsidy in any area of the European Union."
"But the fact that we are against fraud and that we support all the measures which should be used against fraud is no obstacle in our thinking that preventing fraud should not be the only way to establish new standards in relation to the production of olive oil."
"We understand that olive oil, olive production, is an important tradition in the Mediterranean, especially in regions and areas with objective 1 status where, as preceding speakers have already said, unemployment and economic difficulties are very serious."
"In many places the production of olive oil is practically the only produce and it is this which gives rise to a larger proportion of employment in those areas."
"I regret that to combat fraud, solutions are sought which may also be defrauded in the future as is the olive tree subsidy, which has not properly assessed the regional impact it may bring to bear in many areas of the European Union, in areas of the Mediterranean basin, which do not assess the consequences of unemployment and the consequences of rural exodus, nor do they assess the impact on the rural area which a reform of this type can have."
"A few days ago the European Council met in Luxembourg to discuss employment."
"Let us not move now with the measure such as that of olive oil to create more unemployment in areas where there are already serious problems."
"Let us bear in mind that the Accounts Court, in 1991, positively evaluated the way in which the current system of olive oil subsidy has been managed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgetary Control, as we know, had chosen a different option for the allocation of subsidies."
"It favoured the option of tree subsidies rather than production subsidies in several majority votes."
"I would particularly like to note that in an insular area such as Corsica, which has been criticized for so many things, the system of tree subsidies and the intelligent policy followed by our colleague, Jean Baggioni, who is also president of the Corsican executive, my birthplace, has enabled, with Community participation, the renovation, spreading and replanting of the island's olive groves."
"Corsica has thus been given the means to fight effectively against the fires which have so ravaged it over the past few years, without however setting in motion a frantic course towards yields and production, all of this within the framework of mixed farming and the diversification desired by the European authorities."
"A tree subsidy therefore has its virtues."
"But I completely understand that our Spanish colleagues from regions of high production are defending another point of view and, consequently, another philosophy based on yield which justifies employment and monoculture."
"It is the reason why I decided it would be useless to propose any amendments on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I am indeed persuaded that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has weighed up its responsibilities well in deciding not to follow the proposals of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I am indeed persuaded that this is not the last we will hear of this issue and I hope, sincerely, that the conclusions of our colleague, Jové Peres, and of those who have supported him, will help us to avoid the severe criticisms of the system currently in place in the future, which I think are at the origin of numerous cases of deplorable fraud."
"Madam President, whilst giving credit to Mr José Perez for the mass of work carried out, I have to say that we do not recognize some of the fundamental aspects of the resolution."
"Firstly, it seems too conservative to us."
"In fact, it would appear that the current olive oil COM problems are the result of the Commission's unhealthy imagination; unfortunately, however, we know that that is not the case."
"The alarm bells of the marked increases in production declared for the 1996-97 season and the IOOC forecasts for the current season, which confirm them, should also ring for Parliament."
"The olive growers' statements, which are already reporting a huge fall in the prices of olive oil, are not an invention of the DG VI."
"Secondly, the proposed resolution too hastily rejects those options that anticipate a disconnection of aid from the level of quantities of product."
"We are not enamoured by the tree aid, as if it were the miracle cure to all evils; we believe, however, that, rather than reject it initially, accusing it of intentions which do not actually exist in the Commission's document, it would be better to discuss it with judgment and clarity."
"The growers fear that this option rewards land income, they fear a decline for all growers, capable or otherwise, they fear effects on employment; so this is what we have to discuss, and in our amendments we have tried to answer these fears; for example, by linking the new unconnected aid with the utilization of olive production, combining it with the historic profits for uniform regions and providing the possibility for the producing states to modulate aid according to quality parameters and respect for the environment and landscape, for the disadvantaged regions."
"I understand, Mr José Perez, that things may seem a little complicated, but too much planning will not resolve anything, for everything is getting worse."
"How can we think of imposing a single, intensive and productive model for European olive growing that does not create marked imbalances between the companies and between the regions."
"How can we think of increasing costs and support for olive growers on the basis of a single system of production aid directly connected with volumes of production; how can we use such a system to keep effective control of two million producers, knowing the cyclical fluctuations traditionally sustained by olive oil production and abolishing the simplified system of tree aid that is currently of interest to the 60 % of Community producers that fall into the category of small producers?"
"In my opinion, if we follow this path, uncertainty, disputes and insecurity will flourish with the olives."
"All things that do not help the future of the olive growers."
"In our opinion, the entire CAP should start to change direction."
"While Agenda 2000 finally begins to discuss a modulation of aid, environmental sustainability, rebalancing in the rural areas and limits to the increase in production, specifically for the olive which, more than other sectors, can only gain from these changes, it would be understandable for a huge and incomprehensible cultural exception to be invoked immediately."
"Only with a reformed aid system will olive growing be directed towards the often declaimed policy of quality utilized on the market and in an ever more attentive and demanding consumer."
"A strategic prospect for growing which is so much a part of the history, culture and landscape of Europe, is at stake, and only with a strategic choice can it be defended."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, with 28 votes in favour, seven against and two abstentions, the Committee on Agriculture approved a proposed commitment to the reform of the olive oil market, which my group strongly wished for."
"In the Chamber today, we confirm the need to ratify those conclusions with a vote in favour, convinced that they are in the interests of operators in the sector and European agriculture."
"Together, it was decided to find a commitment within the groups and so I am surprised that, after the clear vote within the Committee, dozens of amendments should be proposed, here in Chamber, particularly by the Socialist group."
"I do not understand the logic or maybe the commitments should only be taken when they agree with the Socialist group?"
"We, however, are against almost all the amendments, as some of them distort the meaning of the commitment made within the Committee on Agriculture, while others offer useless answers that repeat what is already present."
"We therefore call upon common sense."
"Beyond the contingent problems, the olive oil sector may expand and develop; however, we should not simplify the answers to complex problems."
"The path indicated by the Committee on Agriculture enables a strong dialogue and a democratic relationship to be maintained with the producers."
"The solutions should be sought with the producers and their organizations involved and not against them; we already have too many examples of divisions in crisis and protests against the agricultural basis as a result of a mistaken relationship between decision-makers and managers of agricultural policies and the operators themselves."
"No good reforms are made against producers."
"The true reforms are those that act permanently on the structures as they are shared by the interested parties and those that exploit business capacity, permitting joint cultural changes together with a modernization of the sectors concerned."
"In the case of olive oil and table olives, the listening attitude adopted by the local communities is even more necessary, if it takes into consideration the social significance of the sector from the point of view of work and employment."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Mr José Perez for the way he, unlike others, has been prepared to look for commitment, starting from different positions existing among the producing countries and members of the Committee."
"This has been appreciated by our group and we intend to defend it, tomorrow, when the time comes to vote."
"Madam President, I would like to begin, rather than end, by thanking the rapporteur, and not just formally, for two reasons: firstly for the substantial corrections made to the Commission's document and secondly for the effort made in looking for a point of convergence between the requirements of the producing countries, valuable attention to making not just extra virgin olive oil but the entire production sector transparent."
"The position approved by the Committee on Agriculture, by means of the commitment amendments, which my almost united group will support tomorrow when it comes to voting, lays down three fundamental pillars for the future of this agricultural production; these pillars can certainly be perfected but, at the moment, they represent the one and only way of satisfying everyone a little or, at least, disappointing as few producers as possible."
"Firstly, the adoption of national quotas is proposed instead of the guaranteed maximum quantity calculated on a Community scale; this brings it into line many other COMs."
"Secondly, tree subsidies are rejected and production subsidies are offered, based on the quantity actually produced; corrections could be made here as well, but it is a valuable way of ensuring the protection of employment."
"At the same time, the abolition of consumer aid is maintained, as it fosters suspicions of fraud and doubts as to the quality of the product obtained from mixtures which are often difficult to certify, particularly with oil of a generally uncertain origin."
"Finally, the funds that will no doubt be saved could be used for a valuable promotional action favouring the incentive not only for the much-desired quality, and therefore for consumer trust, but also for promotion in people's use and taste for this valuable food; also, and above all, they will be used to give a little more trust to the category which, as you know, is currently a prey to considerable anxiety, and not just in Italy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, the Commission's document prefers simply to subsidize the mere physical existence of trees, which may or may not produce olive oil, but which in any event would always be subsidized."
"The Jové Peres report, on the other hand, prefers to subsidize the actual production of olives and olive oil, rejecting an alternative which would lead to absentee landlords who would simply be receiving money for having planted olive trees, and also to an increase in unemployment among the people who help to bring the olives to the presses and actually turn them into olive oil."
"The Commission justifies its option on the grounds of the fraud for which the present production subsidy leaves room."
"The report informs us that the problem is not the rules, which should be improved, but the lack of specific policy measures to prevent fraud."
"Finally, the Commission would like subsidies to be paid on the basis of the existing land registers."
"The Jové Peres report opens up the possibility of increasing national production, allowing for new plantations which would make it possible to return to traditional production levels."
"The options are clear."
"Our vote also goes to the Jové Peres report."
"We must reject changes which are designed to conceal the Commission's intentions, overtly or under cover. It is essential to support by that act of rejection the political philosophy the report represents."
"Madam President, I have just come from my group's Christmas party, and I was wondering whether I should be eating olives or come and talk about them, but out of respect for our rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, and in view of the importance of olives for the history of civilization in the south of Europe at least, I decided to come for these one and a half minutes."
"Our group has of course also been concerned about the potential for simplifying matters and the possibilities for preventing fraud."
"However, we believe that the rapporteur is right, and that olives should actually be harvested."
"If we grant aid related solely to the olive tree itself, then we are not recognizing the value of work."
"This would be tantamount to paying for planting without any intention of achieving a crop, and that is why we support the rapporteur."
"I am sorry, Mr Fantuzzi, but we want to reward work, and the quality of the product."
"There are good reasons for accepting your ideas on account of manageability and fraud prevention."
"But because of the fundamental considerations I have mentioned, our group has decided to stick to this approach, which we also adopted in the Agriculture Committee."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin, as the other speakers have, by recognizing the complex and difficult work which our colleague, Mr Jové Peres, has carried out in this report. I know that he has devoted very many hours and a great deal of effort to this and it has caused him some difficulty."
"We must point out, in general, the positive effect which, up until now, the current COM has enjoyed with regard to olive oil: since a modernisation programme and an improvement in the operations and quality of the product has gone as far as a higher level of protection of the environment consolidating the European Union as the top producer, consumer and exporter of olive oil in the world."
"Unfortunately all this will turn out to be useless if the reform proposal, which the European Commission proposes, is included in Agenda 2000, and this is because it introduces elements which are prejudicial to the correct working of this sector."
"In concrete terms, the proposal to grant aid to the tree and not to production, which also includes small producers, would do no more than cause a deterioration in the quality of oil and in the stability of the market itself."
"It would generate an increase in speculation which would directly affect the consumer, would cause an increase in rural exodus and the risk of turning the affected areas into deserts, this would bring with it a great and serious environmental deterioration."
"To this situation, moreover, we must add that the Commission has not produced either the consequent research about the regional impact of the measures that are contained in this proposal."
"This research concerning regional impact is indispensable because the main productive areas for olive oil are situated in the south of the European Union as has already been said."
"Most of those are objective 1, that is to say they are underdeveloped regions, with no alternative products and with a work-force dependent on the sector."
"The olive is a product which is difficult to replace and, as we have already said, is concentrated in areas with serious structural weaknesses, deprived economic status and high levels of unemployment."
"Having said that, the Commission must respect the principle of economic and social cohesion, and the COM must mark out oil within a regional strategy in which its impact is researched and the agricultural, socio-economic and structural development of the areas concerned is guaranteed."
"I conclude, Madam President, by demonstrating our conviction that this Parliament will take on board the proposals contained in the report which we are debating today and on which we will vote tomorrow."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Alleanza Nazionale delegation agrees with the resolution passed by the Committee on Agriculture on the olive oil COM, as it considers it more balanced and fundamental than the initial proposal made by the Committee, which, in our opinion, did not bring clarity into a sector which needs specific, definite rules for everyone."
"We can only agree with the fair demonstrations of civil protest made by the olive growers of southern Italy, who have seen their income fall, as a result of a lack of control over the origin and quality of the oil in circulation."
"Ahead of the more negative forecasts, there is chaos on the olive oil market, resulting from the Community and national laxity towards those who, in breach of the Community quota, have planted higher numbers of olive trees, proving detrimental to the honest farmers who have respected the Community regulations."
"Consequently, the introduction onto the European and Italian market of oil of doubtful origin and quality, bought at very low prices, is causing the collapse of the domestic price of oil, aggravating an already very critical situation."
"To conclude, the Alleanza Nazionale is therefore against tree aid and in favour of a single production aid, able to guarantee a fair level of income based on the quantity of oil actually produced."
"We are also in favour of an abolition of consumer aid and the creation of an integrated control system running from production to consumption itself."
"It is therefore essential for all the producing countries to set up an olive growing register, similar to the one introduced in Italy, to check the production declared and to define the production capacity of the agricultural companies involved."
"Finally, we are also in favour of an increase in the European guaranteed maximum quantity, in a fair definition of national quotas and in a strict regulation of product labelling, permitting the utilization of quality and the identification of the place of origin of the oil."
"For these reasons, we confirm our support for the resolution, congratulating the rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Agriculture, who have really done a good job."
"Madam President, we wish show the support of the Spanish socialists for the text of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and especially as it is arranged."
"We understand that it is a question of an agreement at the lowest level, and in any case, we wish to make a contribution so that this report is approved tomorrow in the full session."
"We agree with the request for an increase in the guaranteed maximum amount which, although the text does not say so, we think that might reach a figure of about 1, 800, 000 tonnes. The lack, in every way, of realism in the current figure of 1, 350, 000 is only incurring unfair penalties which specially affect, together with a decline in prices, small and medium-sized producers."
"We think that a system of intervention must be maintained, we want the support for future rulings to continue to depend on real production and we also show our agreement with whatever measures are proposed for the promotion and improvement of quality."
"And, moreover, it must occupy in this framework a central position in the banning of mixtures since these are always produced to the prejudice of olive oil and as a fraud for the consumers."
"Linked to the previous point, we think that we have to strengthen the role of producer organizations as an essential element in a commercial and promotional policy in regard to the product."
"Likewise, we cannot overlook at this time a specific consideration, that is table olives."
"This focus should not, anyway, lead us to forget, in future rules and regulations, the existence of a large number of small and medium-sized olive growers for whom, through a specific complementary system or through appropriate modification, their role as producers ought to be recognized."
"This agreement, in general terms, with the text from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development must not prevent us from calling attention to some smaller discrepancies but they have to be addressed."
"Therefore it is hard for us to understand that we point out the efficiency with which current regulations have operated and, yet, we need a deep and rapid reform and that even in this report the correction of serious damage caused by rules and regulations is demanded."
"Something is not right."
"It is not possible to make two positive statements which in themselves are contradictory."
"Likewise we think that we should escape in the future from certain wilfulness, as stated in certain paragraphs."
"There seems to be no justification in stating that, in a short period of time, large increases in demand are expected, and nor does there seem any justification for us to consider that the results of the extraordinary harvest in the years 1996-1997 would be the future reality."
"On the contrary, we would say that we should be a little more realistic."
"I would not like, anyway, these partial and minor discrepancies to tarnish upon our general agreement with the text which must offer a positive framework so that millennial production, tightly bound to the south Mediterranean area of Europe, can carry on occupying an important position in the Common Agriculture Policy."
"The olive in some regions of Spain, and especially in Andalusia, represents a strong source of employment, an environmental concern, the struggle against deserting the land, settlement of population, rural development, and to sum up it represents economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Therefore, in this sense, I insist that tomorrow we socialists vote in favour of the text presented by the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development."
"Mister President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate today is the first priority for us, the producer countries of this precious product."
"The document put forward by the Commission has been analysed by all the previous speakers and especially by the rapporteur whom I wish to congratulate here and now for his work and for having been able to unite, without sparing any effort, almost all the views in a consensus document which many people thought impossible."
"It is an assessment I share - congratulations to Mr José - and here we are, Commissioner, sending him a clear, majority message whereby this Parliament, having heard all those who had something to say on the subject, believe that this reform must go through."
"A fundamental reform, I would say basic, for all producer countries, and therefore for the European Union, but especially for the Objective 1 regions - such as Crete, the Peleponese or the Alentejo and Puglia, Sicily, Calabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Estremadura and Andalusia - with a rate of agrarian unemployment varying from 45.6 % in the Peloponnese to 12.0 % in Andalusia and, more importantly, with a rate of unemployment of 4 to 33 %, but which would be increased if we moved to a reform which would not take priority over real production, agrarian environmental measures and, therefore, employment."
"We are opting for a reform which is based on real production with an adequate guaranteed maximum amount with which we, all the producer countries, can feel comfortable."
"We are also opting for a simplification of the rules and regulations."
"Simplification, not lack of control, but rather a greater control of fraud."
"But above all, Commissioner, you have shown your sensitivity because you know the situation in producer countries - for which we thank you - and you know the reality of the sector. We await a balanced response to deal with the concerns expressed which will allow a balanced development of the sector."
"I hope that the words spoken by President Santer this morning become reality and that, with ambition and realism, the future reform will be set before us."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if it is true that the COM for olive oil has worked more or less well over the last few years and has enabled the maintenance of a large number of business operations and thus jobs, in spite of the competition from other vegetable oils, it is nevertheless necessary to embark on a reform of the sector."
"Mr Jové Peres' report reveals the wider options which must today prevail in the proposal for a common market organization that the Commission will announce to us at the beginning of 1998."
"In some Member States, the potential for olive oil production has greatly developed over the last few years and we can now see that, due to this development, the COM is no longer suitable."
"The reform to be undertaken must in particular take into account our economic, social, cultural, regional and environmental concerns."
"We must keep in mind the following principles: simplification and a greater transparency in the functioning of support systems, an improvement in controls with the aim of fighting against fraud, the guarantee and equity of olive growers' incomes."
"France, as a small producing country with a majority of small concerns and which is currently engaged in a phase of restructuring of its groves, particularly in Corsica under the impulse of our colleague, Mr Jean Baggioni, could not support proposals which would penalise or discriminate against small producers, nor could we support anything which could be considered a threat to the continuation of this production in the disadvantaged regions of objective 1."
"Like France, other producing countries of the Union which also have a large number of small businesses will support, I am sure, a reform which ensures a prosperous and balanced rural base."
"Let us preserve the specificity of the small quality European olive grower."
"The olive tree, a three thousand year old tree, will remain the cultural and spiritual symbol, the feature of union and the memory of the Mediterranean region."
"Madam President, in Greece, when a priest baptises a child, he anoints the child with oil and makes the sign of the cross over it, and this, I think, shows that the identity of a Mediterranean person is very much tied up with oil."
"It is an element of his or her culture and existence, of the economy and of the environment."
"Mr Jové Peres' report acknowledges this and I thank the rapporteur for that."
"However, we must also bear in mind that all the regions of olive tree cultivation are objective 1 regions, that is, structurally weak and with a high level of unemployment, and that olive oil production makes a significant contribution to their socio-economic development."
"From this standpoint I think that the existing common organization of the market for olive oil was essentially constructive, despite certain problems, and that we should categorically reject the European Commission proposal for aid per tree."
"It is important that we raise the maximum guaranteed quantity to higher levels than today's so that it can be adjusted to total Community consumption where there is a gap that can be filled, to average annual exports and to the establishing of a measure of security."
"I believe that the proposal for reform of the common organization of the market provides a very good foundation."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, we are holding a policy debate on a note from the Commission concerning olive oil and the rewriting of the COM anticipated for next year, a COM which I hasten to mention has been in place for thirty years, which is already quite good going."
"We are all agreed that it is a Mediterranean issue, the four sides of the square largely being Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, but also including my own region of Languedoc-Roussillon, and Corsica, where we have more than two thousand hectares of olive groves."
"We have our small producers. We have our three million olive trees."
"It is nothing next to the approximately two hundred million in Spain, but they do exist."
"You could obviously tackle this problem from the technical angle of the maximum guaranteed quantity of 1.3 million tonnes, which should be raised to 1.5 million; or of the national reference quantities, on condition that they are not historic; or subsidies for production, for marketing, of which we have always requested the removal; or even of fraud, there are thirteen thousand mills which are difficult to supervise, there must be a mixing of vegetable oils."
"We also talk of the need for a register of olive cultivation."
"Mr Fantuzzi was worried about the ECU 2 billion that this will cost the EAGGF annually."
"We also talk, obviously, for it is the crushing argument, of the risks of surpluses which justify a reworking of the COM."
"All this, ladies and gentlemen, seems to me quite trivial, because the Commission is dealing us the same blow as it did for wine."
"You start from an old base, you project it and you find surpluses where there are none."
"Mr Jové Peres explained to us that the market could expand by more than 400 % in the United States and more than 350 % in northern Europe, who are just now discovering what civilisation is all about."
"Oil has a great history."
"I remember that, in the Greek amphora they had, not oils, but olive oil."
"But oil also has a great future, for this is the sort of production which poses no problems in Geneva. Tell us that is no big deal, Mr Commissioner."
"This is a production which is at the heart of five great European policies: employment policy, rural development policy, environmental policy, health policy, Mediterranean policy."
"And it is going to be compromised for a handful of ECUs."
"Employment policy because, when there are 750, 000 people employed and tree subsidies are requested, it is in your interest to save 85 % of your costs by no longer maintaining your olive grove."
"So in Amsterdam we are creating jobs and in Cadiz we are creating unemployment."
"Social cohesion policy is also being challenged."
"It is not worth having a cohesion fund, an objective 1, for Spain; if social cohesion is destroyed in Andalusia, Sicily, Extremadura or the Peloponnese."
"Environmental policy because the desert is expanding, and the olive tree is the tree of mountain life, it is the tree of life for fragile existence, it is the tree of life in the droughts of La Mancha."
"Everyone should go once in their life to Almeria to know what drought really is."
"Also health policy, because Europe is a Europe of old people, a Europe of heart disease, not a Europe of AIDS, which affects only a sexual minority."
"So, it appears that where olive oil is consumed, there are no Americans, fat with ice cream."
"Where men are lean, billions of savings can be made on the national health."
"Finally, Mediterranean policy because opening up to the east is going to destabilize Spain, Portugal and the whole of the Mediterranean."
"It has been said in Agenda 2000: we are working on the basis of a constant budget and we will share objective 1 with Poland and the others and we will have an unbalanced Europe."
"And I have not mentioned cultural policy!"
"We are coming up to Christmas and we talk of the Mount of Olives, not the Mount of Oils."
"Even Mr Brittan understood that we were not talking about the Mount of Financial Services."
"It is therefore at the heart of European culture."
"So, Mr Commissioner, I say this to the European Commission, to Mr Giansily, do not cause a budgetary disaster for the sake of saving the end of the candle, a candle made from olive oil, moreover."
"There are technical solutions."
"Fraud has been mentioned."
"Fraud in Greece represents ECU 21 million, but ECU 21 million is nothing alongside the Brussels costs."
"Mr Commissioner, I know very well that even with an olive branch in your mouth, you could never be a dove!"
"But this is no reason not to make peace."
"I believe that the European Commission must stop attacking wine, stop attacking honey, stop attacking olive oil, stop attacking the Mediterranean."
"Mr Commissioner, you have already been invited to visit Andalusia."
"You will be invited again."
"You will be made to eat bread rubbed with garlic, with a little olive oil on top."
"You will be made to eat a sweet onion."
"You will be made to drink a Corbières, a Rioja, a retsina from the Peloponnese, or a Chianti, and you will be made to discover life, Mr Commissioner!"
"Madam President, within the Committee on Agriculture, following an exchange of opinions among all interested members, we have arrived at the following conclusions."
"Firstly: the present system of support for production has under no circumstances presented problems such as to make its abolition necessary."
"Secondly, a radical change in the system towards aid per tree would create many problems."
"The prevailing logic of simplifying the system in order to avoid possible fraud opens the way for many real growers to abandon their small-holdings and creates additional problems of unemployment in regions which are already disadvantaged, while failing to guarantee or maintain the high quality of European olive oil or the leading role of the European Union in the global market."
"By the same token, aid per tree will require new control mechanisms for the avoidance of new forms of fraud."
"Thirdly, continued reference to the need to avoid fraud creates the impression that this constitutes the main raison d'être of any system of support within the framework of the COM."
"However the main objective of the systems of support is to preserve the balance of the market and to maintain the level of income of the producers. The avoidance of fraud lies within the competence and responsibility of the control mechanisms."
"Fourthly, improvement of the existing system and the correction of any shortcomings that have so far appeared must be the objective of the reform of the common organization of the market for olive oil."
"Thus the abolition of the special system of support for small producers, the abolition of support for consumption and the creation of a unified system of support for production will create a framework for a more rational operation and a more effective control of the market."
"Fifthly, granted the leading role of the European Union in global production and the high nutritional value of olive oil, a policy to promote European olive oil must be formulated and sustained by means of specific measures and by the authenticity of the product."
"This policy must target both the global market through an increase in exports and the European market through an increase in domestic consumption."
"In anticipation of the legislative motion of the COM for olive oil, which I hope the Commission will table very soon, I would like to believe that the European Parliament will give a clear indication that it will support the product, based on the principles underlying the report of the Committee on Agriculture and of Mr Jové Peres, whom I congratulate on the results of his hard work."
"Madam President, I too am impressed by Mr Martínez's contribution to the debate."
"I would like to emphasize three points."
"The first is that the present system of subsidizing output, based on actual production for professional producers, cannot simply be compared with that of tree-by-tree subsidies which are totally divorced from production."
"Since we know that in this sector the olive crop represents around 70 % of variable costs, it is obvious that if we were to opt for the tree subsidy system and apply it to producers we should have to make them prove their actual olive yields."
"Otherwise we should be running the risk of abandonment and desertification."
"In that respect, I am sorry that the Commission has not properly elaborated the various possible yield subsidy systems, because there are more of these than the two we have been presented with."
"Secondly, I would like to say that, whatever subsidy system is used in the future, I think the two main sources of fraud in the sector should be abolished."
"The first is the unification of the two present systems; the second is the absolute ban on mixing olive oil with other edible oils."
"Thirdly, I would like to say that the consumption subsidy, which was created as an aid to packaging and quality, was reduced in 1993 and now amounts to such a derisory sum there is no sense in keeping it."
"For that reason I think the amount we can save by abolishing it could be used to finance the strengthening of producers' association, the promotion of consumption and also the quality of olive oil."
"In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that, since a new global reform of the CAP is currently being prepared, it is important to ensure that olive oil subsidies are not subjected to misguided reforms, but that they remain consistent with the fundamental principles to be laid down for agriculture throughout the Union; because in fact, in spite of the differences between them, the challenges they face are very much the same, and therefore the resources and responses to be provided by the CAP should also be the same."
"And last of all, I would like to say that Mr Jové Peres's report deserves our total respect and support, because he has done sterling work here."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, last night I had a nightmare. I discovered that I might have a colleague doing the same thing as is being done to tobacco - making up a report that tells us that poly-unsaturated oil damages the arteries and is bad for health."
"Anything can happen in this Parliament; anything can happen in this world."
"When I was a boy, I remember that olive oil was considered bad for health in Portugal, like unsaturated oil, and now we see doctors urging all old people to take this oil because it will do them good."
"Anything can happen in this world."
"Anything can happen with this Commission and this Europe which is always ashamed of something; we're ashamed of producing olive oil!"
"If we were in the United States, the Minister of Agriculture would be saying 'Just watch us flood your markets with our Californian olive oil' . We do not have the courage to do that, but you can't buy courage on the market and so it's not easy."
"Then we find cases of fraud, fraud that's perfectly controlled so that only those who want fraud get it!"
"Because the truth is that a combined investigation of the producer and the processor can always bring fraud to light."
"Even Al Capone and Lucky Luciano got caught, so why not a poor olive-grower or oilproducer if he commits a fraud?"
"I would like to say, however, that there is an important point, and I will conclude with this."
"That point is to determine the maximum guaranteed quantity on past figures."
"For the Commission the past always means the last three years, irrespective of whether there has been a drought, as in the case of hard wheat."
"This is a disgrace!"
"Otherwise I congratulate Mr Jové Peres, who has drafted an excellent report, for also proposing an olive subsidy, because that will make it possible to start picking the olives earlier, since they are also picked as green olives and for conserving."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, some figures have already been provided - namely seven million families in the Mediterranean."
"So there is also this very important aspect, that olive oil only represents 3 % of total oil sales worldwide, and is therefore a minute part of the world oil market."
"In my opinion, the Commission's proposal does not provide a strategic perspective for this sector; I find it suffocating and also unable to provide a market perspective, perhaps because it focuses too much on mediation within EU countries and it is not directed at the great boost that could be obtained on the world market, a market that provides the possibility for enormous expansion if we only have a quota of 3 %, with a good return."
"The Commission has always proposed its documents with a good statistical basis; this time, the document leaps up like a statistic which I think is fundamental and does not mention employment at all, In Italy, for much of the year, the total employees engaged in the olive oil business amount to employment in four FIAT factories and this is a fundamental aspect."
"The Commission's document hardly mentions employment at European level, while we are talking of nothing but employment, and we are setting up extraordinary Councils; this risks becoming a very counter-productive factor compared with the market prospects."
"I think that the document drawn up by the Committee on Agriculture is a good document, indicating a path to be followed by the leading associations, by growers, by national political forces and also by the members of the left democratic party."
"As far as I am concerned, this proposal is good but certainly needs to be improved."
"It needs to aim at ensuring that the aspects of quality, environmental ecological factors and the possibility of exploitation of the international market are improved."
"I believe the Commission should be called upon to give answers on these aspects."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mr Jové Peres because, clearly, without his work and capacity for dialogue it would have been impossible to achieve this result."
"I say this sincerely to you, from my long experience in searching for consensus."
"It was a very difficult consensus to reach."
"Very difficult, a priori probably almost impossible."
"Therefore, I congratulate you."
"Commissioner, here is a debate, like all those which deal with agriculture, taking place late at night, almost on our own, but which reflects the debate in European society."
"Here you have the response from European society, from European farmers, to the Committee's proposals."
"You have here a reasonable and balanced group of measures."
"I would like the Committee to consider this seriously and rigorously."
"That they do not resort to financial inaction to reject reasonable proposals."
"That the Committee sometimes forgets the dogma that Mediterranean production faces financial inaction and that an Agenda 2000 may be drawn up where the Commissioner's portfolio is to invite everyone except the Mediterraneans."
"Commissioner, open your portfolio and this time divide to north, south, east and west because that is your duty as Commissioner."
"I am concerned about the amendments that have been put forward."
"I am concerned about Mr Mulder's Amendments Nos 1 to 4, based on budgetary control, when the myth of fraud in the COM is quite important in absolute and relative terms."
"I am also concerned about the amendments from Mr Fantuzzi of the Socialist Group, because, if they were approved, they would mean a subtle and controlled destruction of an agreement which has been very hard to achieve."
"Therefore, I ask the Assembly to support the Jové report and reject the rest of amendments so that the Committee can start work on this proposal, presenting us with a more reasonable alternative than the one initially submitted for this Parliament's consideration."
"Madam President, much has been said thus far but I, in turn, would like congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"The reform of the COM for Olive Oil is a major issue and for this reason the report has very great significance, given the fact that there are structural differences between the producer Member States, which, thanks to the compromise that has been reached within the Committee on Agriculture, are being faced constructively."
"Which is why I share the views of those who do not agree with the amendments that have been tabled a posteriori and which I believe we must not vote on."
"It is a well-known fact that thousands of workers in Southern Europe are employed in the olive oil industry. In Greece, for example, we are talking about 710 thousand families, not just workers."
"Aid per tree, as proposed by the Commission, not only does not protect basic production, but also entails the loss of jobs and the downgrading of the product."
"We back the proposal for support for all those involved in actual production, including small producers, as well as proposals such as that for a register for the cultivation of olive trees."
"However, at least in the initial stages, the new method of support must not be bound up, with respect to time, with the existence of this register, because there are certain states which have not yet completed this."
"Also it must be stressed that keeping the same model of support for olive oil in production must not, with respect to time, be associated directly with marketable quantity but with actual production."
"Madam President, when we support olive producers we must be aware that we are helping people who live in the mainly poor regions of the European Union and that, through the cultivation of olives, we are at the same time protecting the fragile Mediterranean environment."
"With this in mind, the fact that reform of the common organization of the market for olive oil is the only reform which is connected with fraud causes quite an impression, and I ask myself whether fraud has not yet manifested itself with respect to other products."
"Is it only with respect to oil that irregularities have been shown to occur?"
"Have we not seen such phenomena with respect to products from Northern Europe?"
"Have all the sins been committed by olive producers?"
"In addition I would like to say that, if amendments to the common organization of the market for olive oil are needed, they are not the amendments that are being proposed by the Commission."
"In other words we must not move towards subsidy per tree since, in reality, by so doing we are equating those who produce with those who do not produce, and at the same time olive producers will cease to carry on intensive olive cultivation."
"What we need is a system of premiums based on production and on a unified system of control for all Member States."
"We also need to move away from a unified quota system. We need national quotas, legally established, because now, when there is overproduction in one country and a low level of production in another, producers in the latter are punished twice over: once by nature and once by the European Union, when the quota is exceeded."
"At the same time we need promotion of olive oil worldwide, since its positive effects on health are well known and, Madam President, we need to proceed to the abolition of support for consumption and to the utilization of money that is left in reserve for production premiums and for the promotion of olive oil on an international level."
"Madam President, the new olive oil COM should have a double objective: on the one hand, it should develop the sector by improving production and the productivity of the plant, the producers' living conditions and world consumption; on the other, it should ensure the protection of the environment and olive growing, a fundamental asset for the whole of the Mediterranean Basin."
"On the problems of guarantees for the sector, I would like to point out that the EU should consider the need to establish regulations seeking to prevent the mixing of seed oil with olive oil, a practice which is unfortunately permitted in some Community countries, for consumer protection."
"With regard to the system of controls, it should be recalled that the olive growing register exists in Italy which, in addition to permitting a knowledge of the consistency of production, is used as a means of controlling the various levels of procedure in establishing aid."
"Finally, we need to guarantee a stability of the oil price as soon as possible, by specific means such as the establishment of a private stock of product, assigned to the producers' organizations, and improving all promotional activities."
"To conclude, Madam President, we intend to make a fairer redistribution and improvement of current financial resources seeking a rebalancing of the entire sector, to achieve the objectives of maintaining olive growing in difficult regions without production alternatives, where its disappearance would create serious social and environmental problems."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Combatting tobacco consumption"
"The next item is the report (A4-0341/97) by Mr Valverde López, on behalf of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the present and proposed Community role in combatting tobacco consumption (COM(96)0609 - C4-0014/97)."
"Madam President, we are entering into a quite different subject which is the European Union's strategy against tobacco consumption."
"And if I recall the title it is because I want the debate to concentrate precisely on this health strategy and not be confused with an area which, although linked, is not the purpose of this report from the Committee."
"Here it is not a question at all of agricultural problems nor of tobacco aid."
"That is dealt with in another Committee proposal on the common organization of tobacco production and it would not be good to mix up comments and amendments here on this matter, because then we can devalue the strategy of combatting tobacco consumption."
"Also there is another matter which I believe it is important to define, and that is the matter of tobacco advertising."
"There is another directive; and only a few days ago the Committee on Health has agreed to phasing in a total ban on tobacco advertising."
"I think we should congratulate the Committee and especially, Commissioner, you should convey to your colleague, Mr Flynn, our congratulations for the work he has done and for the pressure he has had to bear from the political as well as other viewpoints."
"I think that, at this time, institutions have to leave their priorities behind and in this debate the absolute priority is the defence of the right to health."
"And there we have focussed most of our proposals in this area and therefore are making a first positive statement which I think is essential and it is that every person is entitled to breathe clean air and that this right must prevail over the rights of smokers."
"This is not establishing any sort of discrimination, but quite the contrary."
"Likewise, Madam President, I believe that it is very important to protect the workers in the workplace for the same reasons."
"And we also have a very strong proposal to put to the European Commission asking it to begin an interinstitutional enquiry, with the help of scientific committees, to determine if tobacco companies incorporate additives in tobacco to increase the addiction to nicotine."
"It seems there is proof of this."
"We also have to point out the need to carry out information and awareness campaigns to change the behaviour of tobacco smokers in public, with the aim that courtesy and respect for non-smokers will prevail."
"I think this can be an essential strategy for facing the future: education above all and respect for others."
"There is another really important subject."
"It is that we request the Commission to launch a legislative initiative to declare, in the European Union, nicotine as an addiction producing substance; it may make quite a difference to the whole treatment in this sector in future."
"Finally, Madam President, we place great emphasis on this report requesting the Committee - I would say national Governments also - to support the setting up of a body of Government and non-Government organizations to demand indemnities from the tobacco companies operating in the European Union for the damage caused to the health of smokers."
"As you see, they are proposals wholly within a strategy to defend the health of every citizen and therefore it is no surprise that in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection we, all the political groups, have reached a general consensus regardless of our feelings because we are all in this Parliament to defend our basic rights and one of the basic, fundamental rights of a person is the right to health. So we have reached this general type of consensus."
"I would like to thank all my colleagues from the Parliamentary groups for the efforts they have made to present a common approach."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to speak about politics but about the right to health for citizens in the Union, the right laid down in articles 129 and 129a of the Amsterdam Treaty which, as little as a month ago, was the subject of heated speeches in this same location."
"This prompts me to say without beating round the bush that tobacco kills, proof of this is that half a million people die of their own free will each year because of the harmful habit of smoking."
"One death every ten seconds in the world, Madam President, and I really mean of their own free will although then it may be the whole of society which has to take on in addition the cost of these cardio-vascular illnesses and deliberately contracted cancers."
"It is inconceivable that the European Community, inheritor of the age of enlightenment and, accordingly, of reason considers legal a product which it is obliged to label saying that it seriously damages your health."
"However, it considers the public sale of hashish illegal."
"As they are both addictive drugs, Madam President, there can be no greater incongruency."
"Having said this, there is no doubt that we celebrate, as the rapporteur said, that finally the Council has begun the process of agreement - yes indeed timid and limited - on banning tobacco advertising as Parliament has been requesting for years."
"Nevertheless, we also regret that in the debates referred to in Council, the policy on health was predominant."
"The Council can be sure that our Committee will continue to maintain its stance on a total ban and we trust that the Council takes note of this, before settling on a common position."
"Madam President, we want a smoke free Union and without the lethal marketing of the tobacco companies who have now decided to target their poisonous strategies - as the rapporteur points out - on the most unprotected sectors in society - children from 11 to 15 years of age, countries in the process of development and socioeconomic, culturally deprived groups."
"It is really scandalous."
"It is obvious, therefore, that we will support this report and congratulate the rapporteur for his work and especially for its worth."
"I conclude, Madam President, by calling for more rigorous legislation for the protection of non-smokers."
"Let us begin in this House, where no smoker respects the smoking ban."
"Because, for many other reasons, Madam President, I refuse to be murdered by this product, even passively, as the World Health Organization has it."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, Mr Valverde, thank you for all the work that you have put into your report on reducing tobacco consumption."
"Your report impressed me in that it made me aware, in a completely new way, of how we treat tobacco, and it became clear to me that in recent years we have probably often ignored standards of courtesy, social standards as you call them, standards of politeness and consideration for people who do not smoke."
"You have probably made a lot of people more aware of this."
"I believe that this is also an important way in which we can achieve a reduction in tobacco consumption."
"Ladies and gentlemen, tobacco advertising is one aspect."
"Some people believe that banning it is a panacea, while others believe that in a free and liberal world it should be allowed."
"I welcome the fact that we are now in a position to discuss this important subject in relation to a separate directive which the Council has now prepared. It has certainly taken long enough!"
"We should consider that directive with due care, taking into account not only scientific findings but also, no doubt, emotions."
"I shall be taking part in that debate."
"However, I am not so enthusiastic about some of the amendments, whose authors seem to think that health warnings covering 25 % of the total packet surface for tobacco products will make people give up smoking."
"This demonstrates very precisely that we are merely relying on the law, and that is the wrong approach."
"I believe that if people cannot understand the present perfectly good health warnings, nothing will be achieved by making them twice as big; that approach is mistaken."
"I would like to come back to your idea that awareness needs to develop inside our heads."
"I would like to see us working on that."
"One last point, as a rapporteur with many years' experience on the Committee on Budgets: one point is constantly overlooked in this House, i.e. that we generously subsidise tobacco production here in Europe."
"Even worse, we produce tobacco that no-one in Europe wants to smoke."
"If you smoke this tobacco it blows the top off your head!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us start by supporting the Commission, which has made some good initial progress towards finally developing a new market organization that will gradually take us in the right direction."
"I have no time for these dramatic proposals to abolish everything in one year."
"That is impossible and it is antisocial anyway."
"But there is a new approach to employment and I can imagine that by combining improvements in quality with employment aspects we could come up with a better means of supporting tobacco growing, with a view to gradually phasing it out in the long term."
"We should all have the courage to work on this."
"I certainly hope that I will be involved in this work on behalf of my group."
"Madam President, we all agree on the approach adopted in this report and on the undertaking to promote any action helping to discourage consumption, particularly among young people."
"We therefore agree to the prohibition of advertising, sponsorship, the promotion of drastic restrictions on smoking in public places and in work places, etc. However, I fail to see how this undertaking focuses on the motion to abolish aid for tobacco production in Europe, contained in paragraph 29."
"Perhaps the person supporting it is cultivating the misleading view that, by not providing more European tobacco, some smokers at home would give up?"
"The idea is ridiculous!"
"Smokers would continue to smoke by buying cigarettes from third countries and thus worsening an irreversible crisis of agricultural production in the poorest suburbs of southern Europe, that is, in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and so on, where tobacco is often the only crop possible."
"The tobacco sector currently employs 284 thousand direct workers in Europe, with the subsequent stages of production bringing the figure to a million workers."
"European production represents 4.6 % of world production and only meets 40 % of domestic demand; however, the quality is clearly superior, at least for that consumed in Europe."
"And so, in the light of this, the request for the abolition of aid is vague, because it would only make money for the American multinationals."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, colleagues, although not everyone in my group agrees with me, I am a strong advocate of a strict anti-tobacco policy and I fully support Mr Valverde López's report."
"Every year tobacco kills 500, 000 people in the Union, and what's more, the health costs for high-risk behaviour are passed on to society."
"I had never thought that, on the occasion when discussing this report, we would be able to welcome the hopeful decision of the Council of Ministers of 4 December."
"Throughout more than ten years of Council presidencies, the European Parliament's Committee on Public Health has agitated for a ban on advertising."
"This is hopefully a first victory in the fight against tobacco."
"In my country, too, a law was recently passed which curbs tobacco advertising."
"Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must go further than a mere ban on advertising."
"Price is also an important instrument in anti-tobacco policy."
"To discourage smoking, especially amongst young people, a drastic increase in tobacco prices would be the ideal measure."
"The price increase soon turns out be an extremely efficient tool for reducing consumption. It is believed that a price increase of a 100 % can reduce consumption by half."
"Moreover, present European legislation gives rise to enormous price differences."
"Cigarettes in Spain, for example, are five times as cheap as in Denmark, and rolling tobacco much cheaper than in the United Kingdom."
"These differences must be levelled, because they encourage massive smuggling and fraud."
"The tax on rolling tobacco must raised to the same level as tax on cigarettes. Otherwise rolling tobacco threatens to become a dangerous alternative for more expensive cigarettes."
"Analogous to ordinary cigarettes, a maximum tar content must be set for rolling tobacco."
"Initiatives from the industry on this are welcome."
"I only hope that a proposal will not be too long in coming."
"An end must also be made to the contradiction between public health and communal agricultural policy."
"We should therefore not speak in terms of a gradual cutback and long term solutions, because this period has long since elapsed."
"Finally, I support the rapporteur's proposal to urge for a legislative initiative by the Commission which declares tobacco a substance with addictive effect in the Union."
"This approach is comparable to that of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States."
"Why not investigate how compensation can be claimed from tobacco manufacturers in the Union?"
"Mr President, colleagues, the argument on behalf of employment is only too often abused."
"In my country, too, a fight is under way to retain sponsorship of Formula 1 racing in Francorchamp."
"Maybe a little creativity could be displayed here."
"In Australia, for example, sport and cultural events are funded by a special levy on tobacco products."
"It may be true that a strict anti-tobacco policy means the loss of a few jobs in the short term."
"However, the absence of a health policy can mean the loss of many human lives in the long term."
"It is our mission to make the right choices."
"Finally, I would like to encourage the Commission to continue its fight, and I wish to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on his excellent report."
"Madam President, I think that we have to begin with the obvious."
"But it is necessary because in every group there are going to be people who defend this report as necessary to public health while other colleagues, with the great respect and affection in which we hold them, will consider that this report is over the top."
"It is clear that, from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection a report has to come out which defends public health."
"In concrete terms I wholly agree with the report from Mr Valverde for several reasons."
"Because the rights of non-smokers need to prevail, as he himself was saying, over the rights of smokers to smoke in public places."
"It is vital that young people and children are completely separated from that world, from addiction to that world and education and training are needed for this."
"In no way must it be allowed for more than 26 products to be labelled, from valerian to chocolate and the scent of liquor, which are in tobacco - this was acknowledged some days ago by a tobacco company in the Spanish press - and there are some we are not sure whether they are also addictive."
"And because we think - I do not agree Mr Florenz here - that, indeed, the expression which says that tobacco harms your health should be more visible."
"Finally, we see it as immoral for the European Union to export poor quality tobacco to third world countries."
"It is for that reason that we - I should not say we, but rather some colleagues in my group - are going to support this report in full, because we think it necessary and it seems to us that health is above all other considerations."
"However, a way out has to be sought, of course, for those farmers who see themselves as trapped and unable to grow tobacco in the future."
"Madam president, this report has come at just the right time, against the background, among other things, of the Council of Ministers' common position not so long ago concerning the ban on indirect advertising of tobacco products, and also against the background of the Court of Auditors' annual report which was presented at the last session of meetings here in Strasbourg."
"This report shows, among other things, that there are very big problems in the tobacco sector in the EU."
"However, I do not support the rapporteur when he says that we should limit this debate to a small part of the tobacco issue."
"On the contrary, I believe that we must look at the whole picture in the tobacco policy in order to effectively be able to have a strategy on the tobacco issue."
"That is why we in the Left Group fully support paragraph 29 in which Parliament calls on the Council to stop direct income support for the Union's tobacco sector."
"It is quite morally wrong for us to give money to tobacco growers at the same time as we discuss other anti-smoking strategies here this evening."
"It is not only non-smokers who think that is wrong."
"There are also many smokers who think it is quite wrong for EU money to go towards a lot of tobacco subsidies."
"Madam President, passive smoking is a source of broncho-pulmonary cancers and yet three eminent chest specialists, after having studied a number of epidemiological studies said they were unable, given the available statistics, to make a formal statement on the issue. Nothing is therefore established.."
"I do not know if the excellent technical report by Mr Valverde López is going to be a hit or a miss, since the public health aspect and the production aspect are unfortunately contradictory in economic terms."
"You will need to be vigilant on this point, Mr Commissioner."
"On the other hand, what I do know is that this report runs the risk of putting numerous tobacco producers in a difficult situation and, if that were not enough, also many seasonal workers in disadvantaged rural areas, even though this situation is in no way comparable with that of the processing and distribution multinationals, should the fundamental assessments of the rapporteur be misinterpreted."
"The rapporteur knows this."
"His knowledge and passion, under the Hippocratic oath, for medicine and health, must be for us a credible witness."
"But the dark forces of money and, consequently, of policy will be able to distort the validity of his real and legitimate fears."
"It is therefore appropriate to set the debate back in its true context."
"Indeed, the European tobacco industry imports nearly 67 % of its tobacco which it processes for internal consumption within the European Union."
"Also, suppression of production subsidies would in no way resolve the fight against tobacco consumption."
"The image sellers, the pleasure traders, those of casinos and other vitriolic places, will only have to make sterile recommendations."
"Controlling the imaginary Schengen borders, perhaps, we will be aware of the reality."
"Between abuse and abstinence there must exist a happy medium in which producers, distributers and consumers can meet."
"It is perhaps enough that interests should be better shared and state taxation better allocated."
"The highest French authorities tell us that smoking a joint is not catastrophic."
"Allow us then, Mr Valverde López, to smoke a good cigarette."
"So if we cannot see life through rose-coloured spectacles, we will at least be able to make smoke rings, for dreams are sometimes a source of wisdom."
"Mr President, as a doctor I know that the harmfulness of tobacco consumption is quite clear and, from the point of view of a humanist, which we all are, the massacre of innocent people, victims of passive nicotine poisoning, must stop."
"Is it still necessary to remind people that there are plenty of other pathogenic agents apart from the cigar and the cigarette, such as town pollution, to which the Member States of the European Union appear surprisingly tolerant."
"Perhaps it is better to be a smoker in the countryside than a non-smoker in the town."
"We must also remember - and I am glad that on the right as well as the left of this Chamber, several colleagues have noted this - that 67 % of the tobacco smoked in the Union is imported from third countries."
"It does not therefore seem illogical to me to ban all forms of advertising which encourage smoking, including of course, the sponsoring of cultural and sporting events, whilst taking care to maintain the employment generated by tobacco growing in Europe."
"Finally, I have great difficulty in understanding why some groups which, with an admirable determination, relentlessly hunt down Gauloise smokers, at the same time demand the free sale of drugs which they call soft, against the official opinion of competent doctors."
"Madam President, can I add my extreme thanks to the rapporteur for a very principled, intelligent report which very much deserves widespread support in the House."
"While we are debating and voting on the report tomorrow, over a thousand Europeans will die for no good reason."
"They will be killed by diseases of the heart or lungs or by cancer because they inhale tobacco smoke."
"The odds that smokers take would deter anyone but an addict."
"The risk of painful and premature death is one in two."
"Perhaps even worse is the effect on those who choose not to smoke, especially pregnant women and children who are forced to breathe in dangerous particles emitted from those around them who light up."
"Just this week independent European medical specialists have reported than 180 million citizens are exposed regularly to the smoke of others and that twenty-two thousand of them will die as a result this year."
"In the face of that, the measures in this report can be seen to be justifiable and sensible, although some are perhaps more appropriate for action at Member State level."
"However they are a welcome contribution to the overall plan of action."
"The proposed ban on advertising and sponsorship will be discussed here in detail next year."
"It will be an important part of a package of measures which should be introduced not just within our borders but in applicant countries too."
"The aims of providing proper and accurate information, of encouraging health promotion and education initiatives, of using excise systems to help health measures and of removing temptation in the form of vending machines which are too accessible are not just worthy wishes but practical, effective, proven steps forward."
"Separately they will be less valuable, taken together they represent a democratic assault on the lies, the smears and the shameless mendacity perpetrated by much of the tobacco industry, much of which is beyond, and hostile to, the European Union."
"To tackle that misinformation fully we must put our own house in order and reform the European Union tobacco production sector rapidly and completely."
"We cannot continue to spend a pittance fighting cancer and a fortune supporting tobacco."
"It is time to stub out the unhealthy depressing habit to which too many of our younger citizens will become addicted and from which too many more will die unless we and our national governments succeed."
"To help that, I and my Labour colleagues will vote tomorrow for the report, but against virtually all the amendments in support of the strategy explained earlier by my excellent colleague, Carmen Diez de Rivera Acaza."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all of us here know and appreciate the dangers that this consumption involves for smokers and passive smokers."
"But in wanting to substitute health guarantees, limiting free choice, responsibility itself, there is something missing."
"And there are also statistical extrapolations which are made about the incidence of lung cancer in smokers."
"How is the question of non-smokers explained to us?"
"Anyway, it is their choice."
"And results are not going to be achieved by banning, as the facts show."
"But here I wish to point out the danger entailed in points 28, 29 and 30, as has already been highlighted by the rapporteur, for which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has asked for a separate vote."
"I would like to make a firm stand on point 29, which makes a concrete request to the Council about the withdrawal of aid."
"I am against this request."
"Firstly, because it does not proceed in the context in which it was presented."
"Secondly, because it is not appropriate, since there will imminently be a new proposal for regulations in the sector."
"And thirdly, because it has not been made in a suitable forum."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if this point 29 is approved and I am keener on regulating and not banning, in the full session tomorrow there will be many of us who vote against the report."
"And it would be a problem for us, since we are indeed in favour of health, but not by force of an official report, leaving farmers out in the cold."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, a lot has already been said about tobacco."
"I have drawn up a report on tobacco and pleaded the cause of tobacco-growing, I know perfectly well that tobacco is harmful, I know whisky is harmful, I know it does you no good to be overweight, in fact I know that any of these things are bad for you if you have too much of them!"
"It is up to me to keep my cravings under control, and I hate having a Commissioner or a politician prevent me from indulging what I see as a pleasure."
"I take the risk, I pay for the things and when someone actually dies of lung cancer, and it is not always due to tobacco, he has undoubtedly paid enough with the tax on every packet to pay the hospital expenses."
"The truth is that the prohibitionists do not want freedom."
"The truth is that they want to impose their hygienic will on all of us."
"I am hygienic because that is how I was brought up, and it was preferable to concentrate on educating children, so that they actually become careful about tobacco, tobacco abuse, alcohol abuse, and anything bad for health."
"At this moment, however, something more repulsive is appearing in the modern world: passive smokers suing the big tobacco multinationals for compensation for the damage they have suffered from passive smoking."
"And some day we shall certainly find non-smokers suing for damages because their forebears were passive smokers."
"This happens in America because they pay less tax on tobacco over there."
"The fashion may possibly catch on in Europe before long."
"My colleague, Mr Pimenta, has said here that tobacco was introduced into Portugal when we joined the European Community."
"Not so!"
"Tobacco was not introduced into Portugal because in the days of the dictatorship Salazar prohibited tobacco-production there to protect the colonies' tobacco."
"Please note this fact, my dear Mr Pimenta. You're old enough to be aware of it!"
"Madam president, on the whole I think the report we are debating is very good."
"That applies to almost all the paragraphs."
"However, I have some observations."
"The first concerns what the rapporteur said in his speech about the fact that we should separate agricultural policy from this."
"I believe it is impossible to do that if we are to achieve credibility on these issues."
"It does not make sense to use very large sums of money to subsidize tobacco growing at the same time as we are going to fight the effects at the other end."
"That is why paragraph 29 is very important, and it is also important that it is adopted."
"I believe all support for both production and export should cease within a few years. The time should be reasonable with a view to social considerations."
"Another observation is that it is important to distinguish between what measures are effective at an EU level and which belong at another level."
"It is quite clear that clear marking is needed and that EU rules are needed for that."
"There is also need for an effective and comprehensive ban on advertising."
"However, I think that other measures belong more at the national or local level."
"That includes tax issues, age limits, where people sell tobacco and what rules should apply to jobs."
"Madame President, we need more information to young people on the effects of tobacco, a ban on tobacco advertising and clear labelling."
"We should also not be giving ECU 1 billion in tobacco aid to a dreadful tobacco in the EU on the one hand while giving ECU 11.2 billion to fight cancer on the other."
"So my colleague, Kirsten Jensen, tabled and put through an amendment to the Valverde López report to cut direct aid to the tobacco sector in the Union and so release resources which will assist with the switch to other crops in those areas."
"Mr Valverde López's draft report contains much which is good, but stops just as it is beginning to get important, namely at the fact that the EU is not credible if we admit the risks involved in smoking but still go on producing tobacco."
"Each year, some 400, 000 people die of smoking-related illnesses, while tobacco production supports 170, 000 tobaccogrowing farmers."
"This is hypocritical, and it is pointless."
"My colleague, who left the chamber once he had had his say, did not want to hear other views."
"I must say that he was unbelievably well paid by the tobacco industry to come and say as much nonsense as possible in a short time."
"It is a real scandal that members who are paid by the tobacco industry can stand here and talk about such things without knowing what they are talking about."
"It is really scandalous."
"Could the ushers please sort things out there at the back?"
"No, I am sorry, I am not having that."
"Can I ask the ushers to sort things out please."
"Please sit down again."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes, can I please ask you to sit down again."
"We can then sort this out, please!"
"Excuse me, Madam President, but he is saying that I take money from these people, he cannot say that..."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes, you should have made a request to raise a point of order, that would have been quite normal."
"And I would have let you speak if you had made such a request."
"You have now done just that."
"Mr Blak has asked for the floor."
"If you could perhaps put your headphones back on, you will be able to hear what Mr Blak has to say now."
"Madam President, I am deeply shocked at being attacked by a member who cannot bear to hear the truth."
"I have never been exposed to being violently attacked in a democratic society, being physically attacked by someone."
"Madam President, I would be grateful if you would report the incident to the Presidency and that the necessary action be taken."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, I have the right to call Members who create a disturbance during the proceedings to order."
"I am doing exactly that now and I hope that we can now forget what has just happened."
"We will now continue the debate."
"Mrs Thyssen, I interrupted you, please forgive me."
"Please continue."
"I will then let the Member affected make a point of order."
"Madam President, what I was saying was that over the past few years, we never talked as much about the public health as after the outbreak of the BSE crisis, which led us to taking a clear stance on how to deal with foodstuffs."
"We said that this must be based on scientific findings, and if science cannot offer any certainty, we would like to see a political decision-making process which is based on a scientifically-responsible risk management."
"Tobacco is not a foodstuff, it is a stimulant, but this fact surely does not imply we are going to be satisfied with less."
"If we are talking about tobacco consumption, we are not even talking in terms of risk, but in terms of indisputable scientific findings."
"We know for sure that tobacco consumption is bad for one's health, and that every year it is an avoidable cause of death and the source of much misery for 500, 000, that is half a million, Europeans."
"Today we are talking about a statement from the Commission on the role of Europe in combatting tobacco consumption."
"We are of course used to negotiating these resolutions."
"But in this case it is not possible."
"In this case we cannot have it both ways."
"Public health cannot be negotiated. Transferable health rights do not exist either; this is something which was suggested here before."
"So let us approve a clear message for the benefit of public health, and let us approve colleague Valverde's report as near as possible to its original version."
"It is an excellent report."
"The rapporteur not only deserves our congratulations, but also our support and our voice."
"Thank you, Mrs Thyssen."
"I now have two requests to raise points of order."
"I would like to point out once again that I have made an official warning about disturbance during the proceedings, and that incident was really a gross infringement of the Rules."
"I hope that we can let the matter rest there this evening."
"Mr Santini now has the floor to make a point of order."
"Madam President, I am speaking, but it is as though Mr Rosado Fernandes were doing so."
"We are sorry about this incident but I would like to point out that the Chair may also be partly responsible."
"If you, Mr President, had intervened duly and heavily in reprimanding a colleague who so grossly and directly offended another MEP, the incident would probably never have happened."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes has already apologized for his reaction, which is understandable in many ways."
"If the colleague who offended him would do as much, I think the incident can be considered closed."
"Otherwise, we will proceed according to the Rules of Procedure."
"A gross provocation has occurred which the Chair should have taken the initiative to suppress."
"Mr Santini, at first, I could not see what was happening at all."
"Then, taking into account of what had happened on both sides, I thought that the physical assault was the more serious, and accordingly gave a formal warning."
"Mr Blak has also made a request to raise a point of order."
"I wish to refer to the Rule on disciplinary measures, Mr President."
"I think we should appreciate Mr Blak's politeness, a politeness which we have unfortunately seen violated by a very serious act."
"Beyond the apologies and the personal forgiveness that Mr Blak very politely expressed here, I think the Bureau of the Presidency should judge an unprecedented episode in this Chamber, a physical attack against an MEP."
"I also think that the debate should now move forward but I think there is still a huge difference between a political dispute, which can take on more indignant tones even in this Chamber - but we are MEPs, politicians and we know all that - and physical attack."
"This is the difference between a civilized parliament, made up of civilized people, and circles and people who can be classified differently."
"I think that, although, on the one hand, we should note Mr Blak's extraordinarily responsible and significant attitude, on the other, what has happened here is more than a clash of individuals and I think it should be examined by the Bureau of the Presidency with great calm and at the same time with great firmness."
"I agree with your assessment of the situation, Mr Vecchi."
"I hope that nothing of the kind will happen here again, and I thank both Members involved for their willingness to accept the apologies offered."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes has the floor again."
"Madam President, I apologize and beg your pardon for my action."
"I will never allow any fellow-Member to say that I take money from anyone."
"I was not brought up to be a thief."
"For that reason I do not like being called something I am not."
"I have no way of punishing anyone who calls me a thief and hides behind his Parliamentary immunity."
"I do not have the slightest means of defending myself."
"Being insulted in this way is something that puts me in an extremely difficult position."
"I have no hesitation in apologizing to my fellow-Member for what I did, but I would most earnestly ask him not to call any Member a thief, because there are Members who do not like being called by such a name. They are not thieves, they take no money from anyone, because they are here to defend their constituents' interests."
"That is my only intention here, and I therefore apologize to the President once again."
"And if you wish to take any disciplinary action, I shall be prepared to accept full responsibility for my action, quite willingly, because I do not have the natural temperament of a St Francis of Assisi and I do not like being insulted."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes, you have apologized, and Mr Blak has accepted that apology."
"I would be pleased if we could leave it at that now."
"The more we talk about this, the more complicated it becomes, and the more difficult it is to bring to a conclusion."
"I would also ask Mr Blak, who has now asked to speak once again, and Mr Valverde López to note what I have said."
"If possible, I would ask you to withdraw your requests to speak, so that we can continue with the debate."
"Madame President, I am pleased at what my colleague who made the actual assault has said."
"I do not know what the translation was, but this is a political debate to which I came with some remarks."
"I may well have upset him: if so, I apologize."
"But I do not think that that means I said I forgive his violence towards me."
"But I am prepared to refrain from taking matters further."
"The matter is closed as far as I am concerned."
"I do not want to discuss what happened any further."
"Mr Valverde López, can we leave it at that?"
"Madam President, tomorrow the committee will have to assess, with its usual calmness, the events we have witnessed."
"It has not been a mere change in order."
"It has been a direct physical attack which we have all witnessed."
"I do not want to throw coals on the fire, but of course the committee has to assess the facts."
"In this Parliament these events cannot be repeated."
"There has been a physical onslaught."
"I share your opinion and I shall of course report this."
"Madam President, I do not smoke, but more than addiction to tobacco I fear addiction to fanaticism and excess."
"Nobody maintains that smoking is good for your health."
"However, the persecution of smokers, tobacco producers and all those who work in the tobacco industry is almost turning into a witch hunt on the American model."
"Many of the recommendations contained in the report go beyond the Commission's proposals, while some of the proposed measures give the impression that there has been no fundamental study of their economic and social repercussions, nor any consultation with the social categories that are affected."
"The proposed channelling of aid for tobacco into the restructuring of production is to be equated with the annihilation of tobacco cultivation, to say nothing of the fact that this will lead to an inordinate increase in imports of a product in short supply in favour of third countries and without of course any hope of reducing consumption."
"Madam President, I am surprised by the ease with which the north, in the main, invokes morality and health in order to wipe out an important Mediterranean product and all who work in the industry, when it is indeed well known that by so doing we are simply helping the products of multinational companies to enter our markets and when nobody says anything about our other evils such as alcoholism."
"Why does nobody talk about alcoholism?"
"Within the framework of this logic we could begin a very nice campaign against whisky production."
"We in the south, who have no alcohol problem, will be at the forefront of such a campaign."
"Madam President, I congratulate Mr Valverde López on his very succinct and illuminating report on the hazards of smoking."
"The many risks associated with the consumption of tobacco are well-known."
"Nevertheless, smoking is the greatest single preventable cause of death in the European Union."
"The greatest change in smoking habits has taken place among the generations."
"In present times smoking has become far more common among young women, and will account for an increase in female deaths in the future."
"So what are we do to about it?"
"The most important task of society is the promotion of health with every resolution made."
"That is why I support the ban on tobacco advertising, which must extend to all parts of the European Union."
"I do not think we can afford to wait until 1006 for the ban to come into force, as was proposed at Luxembourg."
"The other main way of controlling consumer behaviour is taxation."
"We should tax the life out of tobacco consumption."
"There is a need to enlighten people in the Member States as to the dangers of smoking much more obviously than at present."
"I would expect this to be targeted at young people, especially young women, because they are the group at most risk."
"Among the young smoking is very often seen as a way of being more grown-up, a kind of fad."
"We as parents and guardians have to get involved too."
"Madam President, I would like to say that taking the law into one's own hands is in no way a political argument, but, by the same token, saying that someone who expresses different arguments is being paid is not a political argument either."
"This is unacceptable and I think that the President should call Mr Blak to order."
"Madam President, of course we are all for the protection of public health, but we cannot allow, in the name of health, to be treated hypocritically the crushing of hundreds of thousands of our co-citizens who, in unfavourable conditions in the most infertile regions of the South, are employed in tobacco production."
"The implication that tobacco producers are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in Europe is not only hypocritical but verging on the suspect, since it is a well-known fact that there is a shortage of tobacco in the European Union, and that tobacco imports exceed 70 % of its total needs."
"The abolition of Community aid for tobacco producers will not reduce the effects on public health."
"It will simply increase imports from third countries and the United States, while at the same time completely destroying the poorest regions, which do not have alternative solutions and where tobacco is essentially the sole industry."
"The solution to the problem must be sought in an extensive anti-smoking campaign, in providing information, in the drastic reduction of imports and in the promotion of actions to substitute production in tobacco-producing regions."
"Until then the subsidizing and support of producers and their employment must continue unabated."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, lung cancer is certainly not just a problem for health ministers, but also for finance ministers."
"When the health ministers decided here a few days ago here to introduce a ban on tobacco advertising, incidently despite dissenting votes by my country, Austria, and by Germany, I believe that only some of the ministers affected were present."
"We know that no European state can keep its budget under control without revenues from tobacco taxes."
"So European governments benefit from their citizens' addiction."
"It is very much in their interest for people to smoke a lot."
"Not only is 20 to 30 a day better, 60 a day is much better, as the revenue is correspondingly higher!"
"We know that children and young people who can be stopped from smoking do not turn into addictive smokers later on."
"So how can we manage to protect our children?"
"I believe that is the main question."
"We will never get people who already smoke to stop."
"My husband smokes 60 cigarettes a day, and in the course of a long marriage I have given up trying to get him to stop."
"But how can we protect our children?"
"Is the Community-wide introduction of a minimum age of 18 for buying tobacco products feasible?"
"We already have a minimum age of 16 in Austria, and it is not observed."
"Today a twelve-year-old, even a ten-year-old child can go and buy cigarettes, saying they are buying them for their dad, and the child will get the cigarettes."
"Nevertheless, I believe that if we were to get through this increase in the minimum age, we would at least have a chance of helping a lot of young people."
"Is an advertising ban the answer?"
"We are talking about something which it is legal to produce, which the state earns revenue from, a lot of revenue, and which quite definitely shortens many people's lives considerably."
"But this product is actually a drug!"
"So how is it that we allow it to be sold?"
"There are so many contradictions that we are aware of nowadays."
"I wonder - today it is cigarettes, tomorrow it will be alcohol - there you have cirrhosis or cancer of the liver - next it will be smoked meat. We Austrians love smoked meat and smoked meat certainly also causes cancer of the stomach."
"As an Austrian I am perhaps very sensitive about the idea of a state, like the one we share a border with, which has forbidden everything."
"I would like to thank you very much, Mr Valverde, you have given us food for thought."
"And tomorrow we shall all have to follow both our hearts and minds when we vote."
"Madam President, the rapporteur Mr Valverde López is to be congratulated on his excellent report which brings forward a series of interesting ideas to strengthen the Community's smoking prevention efforts."
"I can assure him and others who have spoken that I will draw to the attention of my colleague Mr Flynn the particular extra ideas that have come forward, and also to my colleague Mr Fischler the points that have been raised with regard to support for tobacco growing."
"The Commission's communication was the first text devoted to an overview of the subject which is increasingly recognized as one of the main areas where joint efforts at prevention can save lives and avoid disease."
"Studies show an annual death rate of half a million citizens of the European Union caused by smoking-related disease."
"It follows that a similar number of new smokers have to be recruited each year just in order for the market to stay the same."
"That is why the Commission considers it is so important to restrict advertising for tobacco."
"TV advertising is already banned by a 1989 directive."
"Member States have also introduced or are actively considering further measures to restrict tobacco advertising in other media."
"The Council of Health Ministers meeting on 4 December, as has been mentioned by many speakers, reached a common position on the Commission proposal on tobacco advertising and this will shortly be put again before this Parliament."
"The measure has been referred to so often and is so clearly well known that there is no need for me to rehearse its contents."
"The text provides a Community framework for Member States to restrict tobacco advertising while respecting their internal market obligations."
"The Commission hopes that the Parliament will support this important initiative when the text returns before you."
"Turning to the report on the smoking prevention communication, Mr Valverde López refers to several additional ideas which could be studied either at Community or Member State level."
"For example, the Commission services have already begun a study of how Member States regulate additives to tobacco products."
"Also, improvements in the labelling directive are being actively considered taking account of our experience in the application of the existing rules."
"The technical standards for determining the tar content of cigarettes need to be brought up to date and the limitation of nicotine at Community level also needs to be examined, as has already been done with tar in cigarettes."
"Last November the Commission presented its report to the Council and Parliament on smoking in public places."
"Further attention now needs to be given to updating the 1989 Council recommendation on the subject to take account of the evidence from research that passive smoking is a preventable danger."
"Health information and education are the principal means of preventing smoking among the young. The Europe against Cancer programme and the Community fund for information and research on tobacco provide the funds and framework for Community smoking prevention efforts."
"These include the creation of joint school projects to educate pupils on the effects of smoking, the development of strategies to reduce smoking during pregnancy and a Community-wide project to involve general practitioners in smoking prevention, for example."
"All of these projects are developed partly using national resources, ensuring that projects are locally based while at the same time having a Community dimension."
"I hope that what I have said shows the extremely active interest and action that the Commission is taking and is contemplating taking on this important subject."
"The very great interest shown by Parliament in this communication and the support already expressed by Ministers at the Health Council in June of this year show that there is a necessary consensus to pursue and reinforce smoking prevention at Community level as a major priority of our public health policy."
"I am grateful both to the rapporteur and to those who have spoken in this debate for giving that effort a further spur."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Humane trapping"
"The next item is the report (A4-0325/97) by Mr Pimenta, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the signing and conclusion of an Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation (COM(97)0251 - C4-0425/97-97/0019(CNS))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today voting on the European Parliament's opinion on an agreement which, significantly, was signed this very week, two days before this debate."
"Parliament expressed its opinion on the substance of this agreement last June, with a clear majority."
"At that time I talked about the reasons why I considered that it did not accord with the spirit and letter of European legislation."
"European legislation was and is aimed at the total prohibition of all these cruel and inhumane methods of killing and trapping animals."
"Briefly, and apart from questions of cruelty, we are opposed to the non-selective nature of this type of trap."
"As you know, it is impossible to prevent the trapping of species which in principle are not supposed to be trapped, because the traps are not selective."
"We also opposed the lack of any clear definition of (I quote the English term) 'conventional leghold restraining traps' ."
"We opposed the authorization of the use of any of these traps in water, rivers or lakes, as killing traps."
"At the same time, we were very strongly opposed to the fact that in the wording of the agreement the Commission had accepted a period of five minutes for animals trapped by these devices to agonize and die."
"I would point out to my fellow-Members that the Commission's proposal was thirty seconds."
"And it has accepted five minutes as a dying period for animals caught in killing traps."
"This shows that the Commission wanted 'an' agreement, rather than a good agreement, because the issue at stake was not to create any more problems with the commercial agenda between the United States and Europe, and between Canada and Europe, when there are already so many others."
"And that is why the Parliament has so often come out against the substance of this agreement."
"I would nevertheless like to state my own view at this point on the moment we have reached and on the tactical aspect of the agreement, since we are discussing its substance."
"The European Union is this very day in the process of entering into a new agreement, this time with the United States of America."
"So far as I could see from the two texts I specially obtained, this agreement with the United States of America is even weaker than the agreement with Canada and Russia which we are now examining."
"This agreement with the United States of America is worse, because it allows more time, it gives the United States longer to prohibit the use of traps with jaws."
"And the worst thing of all is the question of supervision and implementation, because we all know that is in the hands of the authorities of the various States of the Union rather than those of the Washington Federal Government."
"Lastly, this agreement is worse because in this era of spin-doctors, when we look at what the American Press says about this agreement on the basis of the negotiators' statements, we conclude that it is not the same thing as the European Press says on the basis of the information supplied by the Commission."
"And in particular, with regard to the derogations, that is to day the possibility of non-implementation of what is written into the agreement, I should like to ask the Commission what the American representative, Charlene Barshefsky, has already put in her letter to Minister Klaus Kinkel, where she says that these derogations will be applied in cases of extreme necessity and that they will be the same as in the agreement with Canada and Russia."
"And I would ask Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in English:"
"Will the Commission kindly confirm that there are no derogations as far as the phasing out of conventional leghold traps is concerned?"
"Further, I should like to ask Sir Leon what the Commission will do if the United States and Canada try to use the derogations."
"I would point out to my German colleagues - who, I assume, are here in the House - that the letter in question was motivated by the very reasonable doubts expressed by the German Government on this agreement."
"My friends, if it had not been for pressure from the European Parliament we would not even have an agreement with Canada here today; because last January, as you know, there was an attempt in the CITES Committee to allow free exports from Canada, Russia and the United States before we even had an agreement."
"If it had not been for this Parliament, the first version of the agreement, which is even worse than this one, would have been approved."
"If it had not been for the pressure of European public opinion, which we represent, the first versions of the agreements with the Americans would have been approved."
"My friends, we must keep up the pressure."
"We have all expressed our views now on the substance of the agreement."
"It would be a tactical disaster if at this moment we were to adopt any position other than the rejection of this agreement."
"Mr President, we are here debating a very peculiar creature."
"It is called an agreement yet in reality it is a non-agreement."
"I would liken it to the Cheshire Cat because all you can see is its smile."
"First, it should be said that Parliament did not seek this agreement, we want the implementation of the 1991 regulation."
"That was very carefully put together to end the worst cruelty associated with the trade which allows rich women to wear the furs of tortured animals."
"In the face of threats of WTO from Canada and the United States, the Commission took it upon itself to negotiate this non-agreement and it is fundamentally flawed."
"The non-agreement is certainly not about humane trapping standards since, just for instance, it still permits the use of trapping underwater, leading inevitably to death by slow drowning."
"The PSE wholeheartedly endorses Mr Pimenta's report, in which he comprehensively shows exactly how this non-agreement fails to protect trapped animals from cruelty."
"The proposal does not even present a level playing field, since the USA deal is even weaker than that with Canada and Russia and the deadlines are about out-of-sight out-of-mind verbal undertakings."
"The Americans cannot ensure implementation because of their federal system."
"The Canadians are happy for it to have enough loopholes for a pack of wolves to run through, and the Russians love the self-enforcing, self-evaluating system."
"So there is still no commitment to abolish the cruel, leg-hold traps."
"At the end of the day this unwanted, unworkable non-agreement will perpetuate the use of the leghold trap and is unable to improve the welfare of trapped animals."
"Even the Cheshire cat trapped behind its smile."
"I urge support for the Pimenta report."
"Madam President, my colleague, Mr Pimenta, has written a report on the international agreement on the painless snaring of animals."
"This agreement is important for the international fur trade, and it also is of immense interest in the Nordic regions with regard to the protection of animals."
"Mr Pimenta has now stated the agreement is a bad one."
"Very often the best is the worst enemy of what is merely good."
"This is something I really want to stress."
"It is, of course, easy to sympathise with Mr Pimenta's concern over the well-being of animals."
"Unfortunately, however, I must totally disagree with him as far as protection of animals in the agreement is concerned."
"I think the agreement is an important step towards improved conditions for the trapping of fur animals."
"The acceptance of the agreement would give guarantees from the EU that finally how humane trapping methods are can be judged according to international criteria."
"Up till now there have not been common yardsticks for the evaluation of traps insofar as what is acceptable and what should be prohibited."
"The agreement would provide for EU investigation into snaring methods currently in use within its borders, which will go a long way to improve the welfare of animals."
"Mr Pimenta suggests, however, that the agreement be quashed, because it is not perfect."
"So no good will come of it."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations, which also cares for the wellbeing of animals, and for whom I now speak as draftsman of the opinion, considers it absolutely vital that the Community fulfills its international obligations and that a possible new WTO dispute be averted."
"A possible trade war would jeopardise tens of thousands of jobs, which clearly conflicts with the aims of Union employment policy."
"Unlike Mr Pimenta, the Committee on External economic relations believes the proposed agreement, such as it is, be accepted as a better alternative to outright rejection."
"If you can't get the best, take what is good."
"This is a never-ending story, Commissioner Brittan."
"We started it as far back as in 1991."
"At that time a ban on the import of fur from the thirteen animal species should have come into effect, and yet now in 1997, we are still not there."
"We have an agreement with Canada and Russia."
"But this agreement only states that it will be another four years before the conventional traps are banned and another eight years before the other types are done away with."
"This is not enough if we look at the agreements we made earlier."
"I would even say an agreement is agreement, and we will have to stick to it."
"We should not accept any poor substitutes which do not meet the decree of 1991."
"I know full well that in the European Union there has been a struggle between Commissioner Brittan and Mrs Bjerregaard."
"Mrs Bjerregaard lost;"
"Mr Brittan wanted to avoid trade conflicts with other countries, but I have to say Mr Brittan is in the wrong, because the proposed international agreement fails dramatically in the field of animal welfare, and in fact tries to reconcile trade and the environment by not implementing the provisions of the import ban pursuant to the decree."
"That is why I fully agree with colleague Pimenta."
"We must vote against this."
"I am interested to know, Mr President, what is the situation regarding the agreement with the United States?"
"What is the agreement, and, in particular, in which US states does the ban on the use of leghold traps apply?"
"Madam President, I normally have the utmost admiration and respect for Carlos Pimenta's work, but in this case, I could have wished that he could have employed his efforts in a better cause."
"The Council's regulations have always been totally hypocritical."
"Innumerable examples of hunting methods in Europe which are just as gruesome could be put forward, involving far more animals, but which my two minutes do not allow me to mention."
"But, of course, it is easier to score animal welfare points off helpless Inuits in Northern Canada than here in Europe, where the worst that can happen is to tread on a few voters' toes."
"The Environment Committee has said on the subject of fox traps that gravid animals can be released, even if these are only set up in three winter months during which no animals are gravid as far as I know."
"Another objection was that the Inuits of Northern Canada can only live off tourism, in the style of Marie Antoinette, who suggested that the starving people of Paris should eat cake if they were unable to buy bread."
"Now we are close to an agreement which, unlike the Council's regulations, regulates and establishes standards for catching wild animals on both sides of the Atlantic, in other words here in Europe too, where we have had nothing so far."
"But the Environment Committee and Carlos Pimenta as its rapporteur have sensed that the Commission has not followed Parliament and implemented the regulations."
"So this agreement does not have a chance."
"It was thrown out, irrespective of what was in it."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations has produced an outstanding statement which regards the agreement as the first step on the road, although of course it does have its faults."
"It contains both healthy common sense and animal welfare."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for years the subject of leghold traps has regularly featured on our agenda."
"And for years the European Community has supported internationally agreed humane trapping standards."
"That was and remains a good thing, and I believe, contrary to your view, Mr Pimenta, that it has been successful."
"The agreement between the EU, Canada and the Russian Federation could of course be improved."
"But something has actually happened, which we could scarcely have hoped for years ago."
"There is now a treaty, and countries are committing themselves to implement animal protection measures on the basis of treaties."
"That is why I think it is right that we have taken the measures adopted up to now, but we must also start to be reasonable, by which I mean reasonable as we now understand it, because we were also being reasonable before."
"I would like to tell you very quickly why I believe the Parliament should support this agreement, despite many reservations."
"This agreement will achieve more than anyone could have imagined a few years ago."
"Canada and Russia are finally willing to enter into binding commitments."
"Europe's interest in this matter used to be regarded purely as interference in internal affairs."
"We now have a chance to achieve positive changes in these countries in favour of animal protection."
"The agreement goes beyond leghold traps and also covers other traps."
"I would quite simply like to draw your attention to that."
"Only by consistently implementing the agreement do we have a chance to show that further improvements in protection standards are necessary and possible."
"Everyone involved must have a chance to bring their experience and knowledge to the implementation process."
"That is the essential task facing us."
"I particularly have in mind indigenous trappers and animal protection organizations."
"Trappers have already gone beyond what is now found in these agreements."
"They have already taken things much further."
"Finally, I believe that it is a tactical error to reject the agreement with Canada just because of the current negotiations with the USA."
"If we do that, then we will be seen as people who always want to say no in this area, and then the European Parliament would not been taken seriously by anyone any more."
"Let us say yes to the agreement between the EU and Canada, and ask for permanent involvement, because that is important. Let us show realism and wisdom."
"Madam President, I think it is right that since our views on this subject do not have any legal force, we should establish our position as strongly as we can."
"And I think most of the Members of this House feel that this is a very sad day for the European Parliament because the agreement, although it exists - and in a sense it is an achievement that it does exist - is a very weak one and if you have regard to any of the European Parliament's reports on this issue to date, then the agreement in front of us can only be regarded as inadequate."
"It may be that there are other sorts of animal cruelty in the world - I am sure there are; but an indiscriminate trapping system which traps live animals in indescribable pain must be one of the worst, and incidentally one of the avoidable, instances of such cruelty."
"The agreement is inadequate because it exerts very little real force for change on countries which currently permit the leghold trap and other sorts of cruel traps."
"The agreement, as Mr Pimenta has said, omits important animal welfare considerations for the future, and its test of what is or is not humane does too little to limit unnecessary pain."
"In particular the leghold trap is likely to continue in use for many years."
"The derogations in article 10 are potentially massive and the Joint Management Committee that is set up in article 14 is terribly woolly: it will probably rarely meet."
"So I hope that because we are able tomorrow to signal our Parliament's rejection of this agreement, we will simply be able to say to those involved that we regard this agreement as a first step but certainly not the last step."
"There is one point on which I would be grateful if the Commissioner could reply."
"It seems that the Commission was possibly reluctant to implement the original regulation because of fear of WTO proceedings."
"Is this true?"
"How does the Commission regard the original regulation is likely to fare within the WTO?"
"As it stands there is only one person who really emerges with any credit from all this, and that is Mr Pimenta."
"Madam President, rejecting the agreement if you would actually rather have it than not have it would be a piece of self-indulgence."
"Parliament has to decide whether it is better to have the agreement or not to have the agreement."
"I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that while it is possible to point out the inadequacies of the agreement it is unquestionably a major step forward in animal welfare."
"Without it you could have the ban but you would have no improvement in animal welfare."
"With it you will have a standard to be applied and the absolute commitment to phase out leghold traps in Canada and Russia, and now that we have an agreement with the United States, in the United States as well."
"Some questions have been asked about the strength of that commitment and of the derogation."
"I want to make it quite clear that in the Commission's view the derogation to the commitment to phase out the leghold traps is not possible and the Commission is behind the declaration that will be made at the time of the signing of the agreed minute with the United States making that quite clear."
"I want to make it clear that as far as Canada is concerned if there were any attempt to use that derogation, we would activate the dispute settlement mechanism of the agreement in the confident belief that it would not permit such a derogation to be used."
"In the case of the United States we are not restricted in any way and we could take immediate autonomous measures if there was any attempt to use that derogation including a reintroduction of the trade ban which I personally would unhesitatingly support."
"Therefore this is an effective measure."
"It does not go the whole way."
"In the case of the United States it binds the states as well."
"The United States is responsible for the commitment on the part of the states to honour this agreement."
"As such it is unquestionably one which, of course, could be bettered, but which marks a significant improvement in animal welfare."
"Only the agreement can do that."
"Nothing else could and as far as selectivity is concerned, there is no reason to believe that is a serious problem."
"It is undoubtedly the case that selectivity is really caused not so much by any particular type of trap but by the circumstances and natural conditions in which a trap is used."
"As for the longer time for the United States, that is a consequence of the fact that the problem is more severe in the United States and it takes longer to get rid of it."
"The fact of the matter is that we all share the same commitment."
"The only question is how to go about it, how to bring about a significant improvement in animal welfare."
"It is easy for Members of Parliament to say that this is not good enough."
"But I should like to see them do better."
"Of one thing I am quite certain: if there had been no agreement, not one single animal would be spared one moment of suffering."
"With this agreement we will find the phasing out of the worst traps, the application of the standards and a significant improvement in animal welfare."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Foodstuffs"
"The next item is the recommendation for the second reading (A4-0379/97) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting the European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 89/398/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (C40439/97-94/0076(COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Sandbæk)."
"Madam President, during the Environment Committee's hearings on food and food legislation, Commissioner Bangemann of Germany said that the main aim of food legislation in the EU is that it should be consistent, simple, user-friendly and formulated in consultation with all the interests involved."
"And precisely the same message is formulated in the Commission's Green Paper on the European Union's food legislation, which emphasizes that it is desirable to simplify and rationalise the Community's food legislation to simply limiting its proposals to measures which are necessary to protect popular health and consumers."
"I agree with that entirely."
"Before a food can be defined as intended for special nutrition, it must meet specific nutritional requirements in some categories of people who cannot eat normal food, either because their digestion or metabolism is not working properly, or because they are in a specific physiological condition and may derive a particular benefit from a controlled intake of certain substances in their food."
"Infants and young children are a class in themselves."
"The Council should be praised for the fact that this definition has limited the original list of nine categories of food for special nutrition to five special directives."
"But the list should have been four, because Parliament was correct when it said at the first reading that there were grounds for producing a special directive on food for sportspeople."
"The labelling requirements of framework Directive 89/398/EEC are quite sufficient to inform and protect consumers of food which is suitable for hard physical work, and article 7 of the directive in particular."
"Simplifying the rules should not of course affect consumer protection or information."
"But, in this instance, sportspeople are already covered enough."
"There is also a serious risk that general foods with particular characteristics which are particularly suitable for sportspeople, such as pasta and some drinks, would be moved over to the special directive on sports food."
"This would lead to considerable confusion amongst consumers and go directly contrary to the simplification of the rules in the single market which all Member States are already behind."
"So, to me, it seems completely paradoxical that the Council now wants suddenly to re-establish the special directive on sports food."
"And Amendment Nos 1 and 2 propose deleting it from the list again."
"As far as Amendment Nos 3 and 5 are concerned, I do of course quite agree that no new food products should be used in baby food, and that this must be pesticide-free."
"The Council says that special rules for pesticides in foods have already been laid down, but those rules have not been revised in the light of recent scientific knowledge."
"Something should be done about this."
"In any case, I cannot recommend voting in favour of these two amendments."
"If, as the amendment proposes, we demand that the special directive should be called 'Processed and pesticidefree cereal-based foods and pesticide-free baby food for infants and young children' , such a directive would have to be restricted to saying what the requirements for pesticide-free baby food are."
"On the other hand, it cannot demand that there be no pesticides in baby food, because in that case of course the directive would be about pesticide-free baby foods."
"It is all a question of semantics."
"So, logically speaking, such a requirement for baby food could not be made in a directive with the name which the Commission has proposed, and the contents of which the Commission has already promised to amend by the end of 1998."
"The Commission should stick to this, and I would like to have a promise from the Commission here and now that consideration has been given to banning the use of new foods and pesticides in the directive."
"It would also be advisable for the Commission to take the directive on mother's milk substitutes up for review, as there are also problems here."
"The problems in dealing with the special directives which have already been issued should lead us here in the European Parliament to accept that directives may be of a technical nature and yet also have a political content which cannot be left to a committee of experts, but which both the Council and Parliament should have the opportunity of commenting on."
"I am pleased that the Council has raised the question of a special directive on food for diabetics."
"All diabetics' organizations are against the idea."
"They feel that the marketing of and ready access to diabetic products creates false needs in diabetics and that diabetic products have no place in the contemporary treatment of diabetes."
"Diabetics can and should live on ordinary food."
"What matters is sensible information to consumers and a correct and above all individually tailored diet, and not labelling diabetic products in blue, as one special directive suggests."
"Diabetic products contain high levels of harmful fat."
"The product labelling is often deficient, and labelling is vitally important to diabetics, and they also typically cost up to 400 % more than ordinary products, which is a totally unnecessary and unreasonable financial burden to impose on diabetics."
"The wish and initiative for a special directive comes only from Germany, which has an enormous food industry directed specially at diabetics."
"There is a lot of money at stake."
"I have accepted the Council's compromise, namely that we should get the opinion of the scientific committee on foodstuffs before the question is settled finally."
"I would like to end by calling on Parliament to accept the Council's joint approach and the amendments proposed by the Environment Committee."
"Madam President, before us today we have an amendment to framework Directive 89, which relates to particular nutritional uses."
"There was an argument between the Commission and the European Parliament about how many specific directives should be adopted."
"This Parliament had already requested that foods for diabetics and sports foods should be covered by specific directives."
"I realise that the Commission want to have fewer specific directives, but these products are already on the market, and many citizens are already used to them."
"The problem is that if things are now changed in this way, people who are already used to a particular type of food will suddenly be effectively deprived of adequate information."
"The Council has complied with the Parliament's request."
"It was particularly striking that the Council adopted this unanimously, which is why I am somewhat unhappy that it is now proposed to take sports foods back out, and with the support of the Socialist Group, who did not, incidentally, take that line during the first reading."
"My group opposes taking out sports foods, so we shall not be voting for this amendment."
"I believe that we should keep everything as it was originally."
"Sports foods in particular need to be properly controlled, because consumers' health is at stake, they have to be protected against false and inaccurate claims, not to mention the effect of such foodstuffs."
"Nobody is obliged to buy foodstuffs of this kind, but we think that people who want to do so should also have the option of being provided with a high standard of information."
"Madam President, there has been a great deal of talk this year about simplifying Community legislation."
"The aim is not least to restrict vertical directives in favour of horizontal ones, so the natural consequence should be that vertical directives were only introduced when they were really necessary."
"It is therefore remarkable, as the rapporteur has also said, that vertical directives on food for special nutrition are still being put forward."
"It seems crazy to legislate for the Union's sake on something which, when it comes down to it, means eating a lot of pasta and potatoes."
"If we continue like this, there will be nothing which is not regulated."
"There are two very basic problems with these superfluous special directives."
"First, they send a signal to the population group in question that foods labelled in a given way are the most appropriate to east."
"This is absolute rubbish."
"There are quite ordinary foods which cover the need."
"Second, foods for the special groups are often sold to consumers at inflated prices, precisely because ordinary consumers believe they are better than ordinary foods."
"And here I think we are at the heart of the matter: precisely because it is a special directive for sportspeople which the Council has added."
"There is a lot of money at stake here, the way this field has developed."
"After all, sport has become the latest industry, with totally absurd lifestyle requirements, performance requirements and above all high earnings and not least profits for the people moving on the periphery of the sporting world."
"If we want to get into sport, it should not be via a special directive on special food for sportspeople."
"Of course there are special cases where special directives are in order, and particularly when it comes to food, but they must be limited to groups which are known to have special needs."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal to you again in the strongest terms to support at second reading as well the amendment requiring baby food to be pesticide-free."
"Mrs Sandbæk, you are mistaken in saying that is already covered, it is just the opposite!"
"There is still no agreement within the Commission that this food should be pesticide free."
"It has merely been suggested to the committees that the German system, namely a zero detection limit, should be adopted."
"But that does not mean pesticide-free."
"I feel that particularly in an area as sensitive as baby food, the precautionary principle should apply."
"Scandals in the past about baby food contaminated with lindane particularly disturbed consumers."
"We have to make it clear that the precautionary principle must apply here."
"It is possible to produce pesticide-free baby food, and the child's body is after all especially sensitive to carcinogenic substances in food."
"My last point is on sports foods."
"I do not think that we should make special foods for every group, otherwise we will end up with MEP food, which might have to cater for the special condition needed for sessions which last late into the night!"
"We should also speak out against the use of novel food ingredients in baby food."
"Madam President, I would also like to speak about baby food."
"Like others in this House, my group is calling for a ban on pesticides in baby food, although I have to say that we believe this criterion will be met if the limit value set is close to the detection limit."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has not got that far yet."
"We are extremely annoyed that this subject has been repeatedly put off by the Commission, and that they quite simply do not get round to it."
"Scientific data is already available, and there are clear grounds for saying that, for lindane for example, the limit value applying to adult foods is just not enough, and babies are clearly more sensitive than adults."
"BSE should have taught us that whenever there is even a mere suspicion, we should take it very seriously and rule out any risk."
"Now, maybe the Commission is going to say that this is the wrong place, and that this should not be sorted out here."
"In that case, I wonder why the Commission has not yet sorted it out in the right place!"
"You should have decided on a limit value close to the detection limit long ago, and then we would not still be discussing this."
"If you discuss this over the next few weeks, I hope it will be settled, and then there will not of course be any need for this amendment."
"If you can say today that you will do that, then our amendment can be dropped."
"But I appeal to the Commission to set really strict limit values."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this proposal is to reduce the number of directives in this area."
"Nonetheless, during the first reading, the Commission accepted Parliament's request to add another group to the four originally proposed, namely foods for diabetics, and to define the conditions for using the terms 'low sodium' and 'gluten-free' ."
"The Commission submitted an amended proposal doing that."
"The Council did not entirely share our views and wanted to replace diabetic foods with sports foods."
"We were not convinced about the necessity to have a specific directive on sports foods and I am glad to see that view is widely shared here today."
"We said so at the time."
"We also said so in the Council where the Commission defended strongly our amended proposal."
"The Council modified it against our will and sports foods, according to the Council's common position, would be the subject of a specific directive."
"As we said in our communication to you on the common position we do not agree with that and we consider that treating sports food separately is neither scientifically nor politically justified."
"Amendment No 3 concerning the use of novel food ingredients is another matter."
"This is not the right place to introduce such a provision."
"In addition, I do not agree with this blanket prohibition since it is not necessary in the interests of the health of infants and young children."
"There are rules concerning the use of these products in the Community which we think offer necessary guarantees."
"With regard to the addition to the title of cereal-based foods and baby foods that they should be pesticide-free, our view is that this is not the right place to have such a compositional provision."
"I am not able to say whether it would be considered appropriate elsewhere."
"If it is to exist, the right place is in a specific Commission directive where we have delegated power to adopt and which is currently being prepared."
"Parliament will be informed of that in accordance with the modus vivendi procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Cofinancing with NGOs for developing countries"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0371/97) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation on co-financing operations with European non-governmental development organizations (NGOs) in fields of interest to developing countries (C4-0442/97-95/0168(SYN)) (rapporteur: Mr Paasio)."
"Madam President, the cofinancing of the projects and actions of the non-governmental organizations in development actions in the poor countries of the world and training for the development of Europe has probably been the most positive, dynamic and innovative sector in the external projection of the European Union for many years, utilizing the direct contribution made by civilized society in relation to the populations in the southern part of the world."
"The current budget line B7-6000 has grown constantly over the years, thanks in particular to the boost given to the European Parliament and to a broadly positive assessment of the impact of the NGO actions."
"It is natural for such an important sector of intervention to find its own clear and established legal basis: this is the objective of the draft Regulation that we are examining on a second reading today."
"It should be pointed out, however, that, for over twenty years, the cofinancing of NGO projects has operated very well, even without a specific legislative regulation."
"This has led us to consider, on the first reading, that we should not unnecessarily burden procedure that is already consolidated with useless, inefficient and binding regulations."
"I am referring in particular to the aspects of setting up committees, which Council intends to introduce and which Parliament is contesting strongly."
"Mr Paasio, whom I wish to thank, has done a good job, by managing to get the entire Committee on Development to agree to his amendments which, with the addition of amendment 9, will receive the full support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"However, I would like to take the opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to our Parliamentary group for the denial and immense and complex work carried out in recent years by the NGO cofinancing unit of the European Commission, and ask the Commission to finally reinforce it in terms of staff."
"I hope that, in the next few months, the work involved in defining the new regulations and general conditions for cofinancing that enable a leap in quality to be made in the management methods of the NGO projects by the European Commission will proceed."
"Non-governmental cooperation in development has found and will find real and sincere support in our group."
"As well as the more general means of cooperation, it is enabling the commitment to new subjects and new objects of human and participatory development to be refocused."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Paasio, and to congratulate him on his report."
"This is actually his first report to the Parliament and I think that in conjunction with our group he has carried out this task admirably."
"But I would also like to thank the organizations being discussed here, that is the nongovernmental organizations."
"They do enormously important work for the European Union and for people in less developed countries."
"In the first place, it is good that they make a contribution themselves and this means that the effectiveness of aid is automatically increased, as anyone collecting donations to a particular project has a great responsibility to make sure that the money is also spent properly."
"Secondly, NGOs - especially church NGOs, but also many private initiatives - have partners on the ground whom they can trust and with whom they can work very well, and who also know the local structure very well."
"That is why we should continue to help NGOs."
"It is a good sign that we have already significantly topped up the relevant funding in the budget for next year."
"However, there are also a few problems."
"I cannot praise the staff in the unit which administers the relevant budget line too highly - from personal experience I can say that they seem to be very committed."
"But the NGOs have a problem in that the time before an application is approved or rejected is very long."
"Anybody who knows this business will confirm that it is simply not possible to withhold money for a whole year."
"Once projects have been planned with partners, they have to be tackled sooner or later."
"For that reason, I think that Amendment No 9 is very important, as it specifies that a reply has to be given within at most nine months."
"I think that this actually possible in the present situation, difficult as it is for the staff, but we would also try to shorten the delay still further, and I therefore believe that this unit needs more staff."
"I am not saying this to be entertaining, but because I really think that this needs looking at."
"I am addressing this comment to Sir Leon Brittan but I also think that the other commissioners need to consider if in one of the Commission's other Directorates-General there are not perhaps some staff who could be transferred to remove this bottleneck in DG VIII."
"These people are really overloaded, and they need more staff so that the money for this important work can be properly administered."
"Madame President, I would like to agree with some of the things which the previous speaker, Mr Liese, said about speed in dealing with resources."
"It is vital for NGOs, which of course work in a different, unbureaucratic way, that business should proceed reasonably smoothly."
"Also, there may well be some people who think that it is rather amazing that we are standing here and talking about how to aid NGOs because, after all, NGOs are just that - non-governmental."
"And so of course it is being said that we will support NGOs financially without making them in our own image, because we need them, because they can do things which the public sector cannot."
"Above all, they can look at the people they are working with on an entirely different equal principle, because they are not burdened by government bureaucracy, rules and regulations, having to justify every step etc. And the people they talk with, and who do not agree with the NGOs, can speak out against them without needing to fear repression."
"So NGOs should be supported."
"On the other hand, the responsibility for how they are supported is still a democratic matter, and so democratic control is still needed."
"But it is impossible to exercise democratic control in a completely closed system, and that is why I would like to emphasize the third section of Amendment No 7, which says that meetings of the Committee of representatives of Member States which assists the Commission should be public unless there are convincing reasons to the contrary."
"But what shall we do with this secretiveness?"
"Openness is difficult, people have a tendency to meddle, but we are better off with it than without it."
"Madam President, I would also like to stress that the non-governmental organizations are very valuable partners in aid work."
"They show a great commitment, often great knowledge and often make a large voluntary contribution."
"Therefore, as the good partners and good complement that they are for the other aid, they must be treated both with respect and trust."
"We can best do that by providing efficient and correct processing of their project applications."
"They should not be met by suspicion, almost insurmountable obstacles and complicated application forms, big bureaucracy and long waiting times."
"I therefore welcome, as many others here have done, Amendment No 5 to article 6.1 of the report about limits on how long an application from the non-governmental organizations should be allowed to take."
"It is good that there is now a clear regulation."
"I am, however, convinced that cooperation with non-governmental organizations can be made more efficient. For example, by making more use of the opportunities for framework agreements, particularly with the large aid organizations which have a lot of experience and a high level of integrity."
"It is, by the way, a method which I have discussed in a very positive spirit with Commissioner Pinheiro during a previous question time."
"I believe we have an opportunity to go further in this area so that there is more time left to deal with applications from the small organizations which perhaps require not only an extra careful examination, but also advice about their work."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Paasio for the excellent quality of his report."
"With regard to the personnel questions, I will draw the points that have been raised to the attention of my colleague, Mr Pinheiro."
"Parliament, of course, has always attached the greatest importance to cofinancing the development NGOs, and has consistently increased the budget line for these activities."
"On numerous occasions Parliament has reaffirmed the specific and irreplaceable roles of NGOs and the importance of their operations."
"I fully share that view, as does the Commission as a whole, and this approach is reflected in the draft regulation, which the Commission welcomes and supports."
"With regard to the eight amendments, the Commission can accept most of them, either because they reflect common goals already pursued and practices already followed by the Commission, or because their aim is to supply more complete information."
"I refer here to Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (second and third parts), and 5 (second part)."
"However, the Commission has problems with - for various specific reasons - Amendments Nos 5 (first part and third part in its present form), 6 (first part), 7 and 8."
"Amendment No 5 (first part in its present form) states that as a rule the Commission must decide within six months whether an operation presented by an NGO will be cofinanced or not."
"We agree that an NGO has a right to a definite answer as quickly as possible and have no problem about the six-month deadline but we think there should be added to the amendment the words 'if during the appraisal of the application it appears that the application is incomplete, the abovementioned delay should run from the date of the reception of the information requested, that is to say not from the date of the application' ."
"That is done specifically in order to avoid the rejection of many otherwise excellent projects for which full information has not been made available in time."
"So we accept the spirit of the amendment but would like to add that further point."
"Amendment No 5, third part, though, is not acceptable because a one-month delay to check the completeness of the documents is already incorporated in the six-month delay, which I have just mentioned, and therefore is not necessary."
"It is a drafting point and nothing more than that."
"With regard to Amendment No 6, first part, the deadline of 30 June of each year is unfortunately an unrealistic one and it would not be sensible to indicate our support for that."
"Amendment No 7 states that the Commission is to be assisted by an advisory committee of the Member States."
"We do not agree with that, because it is at variance with the solution already reached in the common position on comitology, which represents the only compromise that was possible after two years' discussion with the Member States and we think we should now come to a decision."
"Finally, with regard to Amendment No 8, providing that the Council Regulation should be subject to revision after five years, if you look at the time taken in the discussion on the Regulation - which has already been going on for two and a half years - it is time to have some stability, and we would not favour a five-year revision period."
"However, these are comparatively small points and most of the amendments we accept."
"I should like to thank Parliament for its commitment over years in favour of development NGOs and their work, and underline our determination to continue to cooperate fruitfully with such NGOs for the benefit of the poorer sections of the population in developing countries."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.36 a.m.)"
"Statement by the President"
"Before reading the Minutes, I have to take a decision which really affords me no pleasure."
"Last night there was an unpleasant incident in the House when, for the first time ever, a Member of this Parliament physically attacked another Member of this Parliament."
"The Rules contain plenty of measures for dealing with inappropriate behaviour, including extremely aggressive acts, and there are corresponding formalities."
"We cannot allow verbal attacks, however aggressive, to lead to actual physical violence."
"Mrs Hoff, who was in the Chair at that point in the sitting, issued the appropriate reprimand under Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, and at the same time announced that Rule 110 would be applied."
"As you know - and I will read out the Rule - ' In serious cases of disorder, the President may, after giving formal notice, move, either immediately or no later than the next sitting, that Parliament pass a vote of censure which shall automatically involve immediate exclusion from the Chamber and suspension for two to five days.'"
"This morning's sitting is the next sitting, and, pursuant to that Rule, I am obliged to move a vote of censure on Mr Rosado Fernandes, which would entail his suspension for two days."
"As is reasonable, and laid down in paragraph 2 of the same Rule, Mr Rosado Fernandes is entitled to explain his behaviour to Parliament."
"I ask Mr Rosado Fernandes whether he wishes to exercise that right, and naturally invite him to speak."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes."
"Mr President, I will speak in Portuguese, since I have the honour to be addressing a President who speaks my language."
"Yesterday something happened which I would have liked to avoid, and which I am not proud of."
"I find myself subject to disciplinary procedure and I no doubt deserve it."
"But I would like to ask this House what any of us would do when a Member who has no knowledge of our lives and thinks we are not in the Chamber - and I was still in the Chamber, I had simply left my seat - says in front of everyone that I get money from the tobacco companies?"
"In the first place, from the political point of view, it is easier to get money from the tobacco companies for speaking against European production than for speaking in favour of it, as I did in my report."
"In the second place, I got up and told Mr Blak I was here - because he had been mistaken - I was here and I had heard what he said."
"I just did not want to believe what I had heard."
"I went up to him and asked him 'What did you say?' And he replied, in English because that was the language I used to him, ' You just get money from them ' ."
"Mr President, I am not made of wood, nor yet of stone."
"I was brought up in an Iberian civilization where honour is still respected."
"I have two daughters and I would like to them to take pride in their father's name."
"So I shall consider myself to have deserved whatever punishment Parliament sees fit to impose on me, but I shall not be ashamed of it!"
"The House has heard Mr Rosado Fernandes' explanation and, without further debate, I put to electronic vote the proposal I made earlier to the House, that is to say, a vote of censure involving suspension for two days."
"(Parliament approved the President's motion)"
"In view of the outcome of the vote I am obliged to ask Mr Rosado Fernandes to be good enough to leave this House and return on completion of his two days' suspension, and I rely on him to cooperate."
"Mr Hänsch wishes to raise a point of order."
"Mr President, since physical aggression against a member of my group has actually been applauded in this House, I must say, Mr President, that I would have welcomed a word of solidarity and sympathy from you for the victim of this attack, namely our colleague Freddy Blak."
"If we are still on the same subject, I will invite Mr Giansily and no-one else to speak, because he is a member of Mr Rosado Fernandes' group."
"Mr Giansily."
"Mr President, I do not wish to say any more on the incident just dealt with."
"I would however like to say that it seems we are now about to vote, without a break, on an extremely important subject: the budget."
"In view of what has just happened, I do not think our group will be able to vote calmly."
"I would therefore like to ask for the sitting to be suspended for a few minutes to enable our group to hold a meeting."
"Mr Giansily, as you know, the vote this morning will be long and very important."
"I am sure that the members of your group will be able to cope and vote calmly."
"We still have to approve the Minutes, which will give them time to think."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I have the following comment to make. I discovered this morning that a commemorative envelope has been issued, by the European Parliament, of Mr Georges Marchais, who approved of all the communist crimes, who supported the invasion of Poland, and the invasion of Afghanistan."
"I would like to know how and on what basis this issue was decided."
"Mr Gallou, it is not a European Parliament publication."
"A private philately firm published the envelope."
"So the European Parliament has nothing to do with this issue, which is completely private."
"Mr Puerta has asked to speak."
"I would ask him to be brief on this matter."
"Accusations have been made against a person in his political group and I must provide the opportunity to rebut them, but I would thank him not to prolong the matter."
"Mr Puerta."
"Mr President, I must explain that I am the leader of a group which includes communist Members, although I am a socialist."
"And I find what we have heard unacceptable."
"It does not seem to me to be a fitting reply - if I may say this to you, Mr President - to say that the envelope in question was not officially published by Parliament."
"Mr Marchais was the leader of a party which took part in all aspects of democratic life in France and tribute has been paid to him by French democrats, starting with the present French Prime Minister."
"I believe he deserves much greater respect in this House than shown by the benches from which this unacceptable description, which I have to rebut, originated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think the incident is closed."
"Mr Lataillade."
"Mr President, I returned to the European Parliament in September after a three-year absence."
"I see here some familiar faces, some less familiar, and a number of issues which are apparently still recurring."
"I do not want to talk about what took place earlier."
"The House has imposed a sanction, which Mr Rosado Fernandez has accepted."
"But I am concerned about the nature of the remarks I am hearing, here and there, accusing certain people, without evidence, of financial corruption."
"I would be pleased, in this respect, if you would give the House all the documentation regarding anyone involved in any way in the design and construction of the Parliament buildings in Brussels, so that we do not have to listen here to libellous remarks which, I believe, might provoke Members to understandable, although inadmissible anger."
"I should therefore be grateful, Mr President, if you would remind all the group leaders - and I am asking you this as a Member, returning to this House after a three-year absence, who is very surprised at the atmosphere he has found here - that Members should be more restrained, unless they are able to produce evidence to back up any libellous accusations they make."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mr Lataillade."
"Your remarks will be forwarded to the Conference of Presidents, whose members have, moreover, had the opportunity to hear to them personally."
"Votes"
"Before the vote is taken, Mr Tillich, the rapporteur, wishes to make a brief statement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope now that as we proceed to the vote on the budget it will help to calm things down somewhat."
"I would request that you take note of two comments which have to be made before we move on to voting."
"We have to make two technical corrections, and here I am asking for your understanding and approval."
"The first correction concerns Amendment No 1, which refers to the matter of Commission personnel attending last week-end's summit."
"For this reason the reference to last week-end's summit must be deleted."
"This is only one reference."
"Then there is a further technical correction to be made to Amendment No 36."
"My proposal here is as follows: since Amendment No 36 contains an expression which is contrary to previous joint resolutions and designations, this should be adapted to comply with normal forms of designation and Amendment No 36 corrected accordingly, so that we can vote on it in the appropriate manner."
"Mr President, let me dampen any feelings of preChristmas joy among the members of the Commission by saying that the rapporteur was referring only to the asterisk and not to any relinquishing of the reserve itself!"
"I only say this in order to keep pre-Christmas high spirits within reasonable limits."
"Mr President, there is a Neapolitan expression, which I do not know how to translate, that says, ""cà nisciuno è fesso!'"
"I want to explain what Mr Tillich refers to as a ""technical amendment' ."
"The European Parliament has included in the 1997 budget an item for cooperation with the People's Republic of China: it voted on it at first and second readings in 1997; it voted on it again on the first reading for the 1998 budget."
"This Amendment No 36 falls into block 3 and the deadline for the submission of technical amendments or corrections expired at midday on Tuesday; in fact, when I asked you if it was possible to include separate votes, yesterday at 6.30 p.m., I was rightly told that the deadline had expired."
"It seems strange and quite intolerable to me now to accept that the reference to this expression should be deleted: something has been voted through by the Chamber and it therefore has the force of res judicata , forms part of a block and now the rapporteur, not knowing what to do, tells us there is a correction, whereas it was included in last year's budget and in this year's budget."
"I ask you, Mr President, not to accept this, precisely because, at least in principle, ""cà nisciuno è fesso' !"
"If I have understood correctly, one of the technical points mentioned by Mr Tillich is more in the nature of an oral amendment."
"To be able to include it, I have to ask the House whether there are more than twelve Members who oppose it."
"(More than twelve Members opposed the amendment, which was therefore rejected)"
"On the completion of voting, may I ask the Council whether it can agree with Parliament on the new maximum rate of cost increases on the basis of our deliberations?"
"(The President-in-office of the Council agreed)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischbach."
"I invite you to speak."
"Mr President, the vote was over so quickly that it has taken me quite by surprise."
"I would nevertheless like to tell you, Mr President, and all the honourable Members of this Parliament, that the Presidency is obviously delighted with the overall agreement we have reached on the 1998 budget."
"This is in fact a good budget."
"It is a good budget because it is the result of a good understanding, of mutual understanding between the two authorities, the two branches of the budgetary authority, but also and more importantly the result of close cooperation, based on mutual trust between the Council and Parliament, and today's result has been achieved, Mr President, essentially thanks to Parliament, its Committee on Budgets, the chairman of that Committee and the two rapporteurs, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, whose commitment, enthusiasm and loyalty I have appreciated throughout this budgetary procedure."
"Mr President, I would also like to conclude by thanking the Commission and in particular Commissioner Liikanen and his colleagues for their efforts, which have made a decisive contribution to this overall agreement."
"My sincere thanks to you all."
"I am obliged to Mr Fischbach for his remarks and declare that the General Budget for 1998 has been finally approved."
"(The General Budget for 1998 was signed immediately thereafter)"
"Mr Chairman, I just wanted to say that it seems to me - and I think that the rapporteur agrees with me - that Amendments Nos 5 and 2 are perfectly compatible and can be combined."
"Starting as you do with the vote on Amendment No 5, Amendment No 2 can then be added - they are not mutually exclusive."
"Mr President, I wish to reiterate what Mr Bourlanges has just said."
"These two amendments are basically congruous and indeed Amendment No 5 could be a supplement to Amendment No 2."
"Even the other side of the House, which has shown itself keen to vote against the motion, could support an amalgamation of the two amendments."
"I therefore recommend this to the House."
"(Parliament approved the resolution as amended)"
"On behalf of this House, I should like to welcome the new bureau members from the Polish Delegation to the EU-Poland Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"It is a great pleasure to have them with us this morning."
"We welcome you and your delegation, Mr Mazowiecki, at this historic moment, following the European Union's decision to commence negotiations for Poland's entry in a few months' time."
"Mr President, you have taken the votes rather quickly."
"I wanted to take the floor to request that Amendments Nos 168, 104 and 172 be voted on together, as they are an addition."
"As I have not had the time to speak, and neither has the rapporteur, I should like the opinion of the rapporteur to be requested with regard to these amendments."
"Mr Pompidou, we did that on the responsible Committee's recommendation."
"That is why the rapporteur has not expressed an opinion."
"If the responsible Committee considers them compatible, so must I."
"Mr President, Mr Pompidou is absolutely right."
"The amendment proposed by Mr Adam adds half a sentence at the end and we support that addition."
"The rest remains the same."
"The amendment proposed by the Liberal Group adds a further two words, namely materials and technologies."
"Mr Adam also wishes to remove two other words, namely ""new vessels' ."
"We are against this deletion."
"For my part, I am in favour of both amendments as additions."
"Mr President, thank you very much indeed for your Christmas wishes."
"Speaking for our group, I would be happy to persevere with the separate voting, as originally planned."
"Thank you."
"In relation to amendment No 122"
"Mr President, Amendment No 122 proposed by Mrs McNally and others on behalf of the Socialist Group provides for the creation and development of supporting measures for businesswomen."
"A separate programme dedicated to female entrepreneurs, namely the Now programme, has already been set up under the European social fund, and I do believe it is more logical to combine our efforts in this area."
"I only say this by way of explanation."
"We support the proposal in principle, but believe that it is somewhat out of place here."
"I am sorry, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, but we have already dealt with that amendment and we cannot revert to it at this stage in the voting."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Madam President, as you heard, yesterday the Commission expressed great goodwill towards the European Parliament. I should however like the following point to be brought to the attention of the Bureau."
"I asked a written question on the Commission's information policy. Mr Santer replied that to answer the honourable (of course!)"
"Member's questions in detail would necessitate a large amount of research, which the Commission was not able to undertake at that time. I do not mind being told, in so many words, that I am of no account and quite useless, but I would however like to ask the Bureau to examine the Commission's attitude to a question, which it would not actually have cost much to answer!"
"Mrs Dury, I am very pleased to refer your remark to the Bureau, especially as I know what the question you asked was, and I consider that it was justified."
"It would have been very useful for you to receive a reply."
"I will try to ensure that you do."
"After the vote on Amendment No 2"
"Madam President, I have already addressed the House on the subject of the motion, though this had little impact."
"I find it strange that while our committee is busy drawing up a position on UCLAF, the chairman of that committee is at the same time engaged in anticipating the possible results of these deliberations."
"That is all I want to say about the amendment which has just been voted on here."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I would like to ask the Group of the Party of European Socialists to withdraw their demands for roll-call votes because we already know what the Parliament's position is."
"It is not necessary to resort to a roll-call vote every time for things which are pretty clear."
"Mr Anastassopoulos, I think this is a sensitive issue, but as we have been asked to hold these roll-call votes, we must do so, except of course, if the Socialist group withdraws its requests."
"However, I do not think that is the case."
"After the vote on paragraph 7.2"
"Madam President, please forgive me but do the political groups realise that each roll-call vote costs the European taxpayer ECU 1, 000?"
"Mr Anastassopoulos, that is the price of democracy."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"- Mr President, my group was unable to vote, at second reading, for the 1998 budget of the European Union."
"We therefore did not join in the consensus the President applauded just now."
"In fact, we noticed that at second reading, the House drew back compared with the vote at first reading."
"At that time, in fact, the majority of the House had increased the Council budget from 0.7 % to 2.7 %, the same increase as in the expenditure of the European Union."
"At second reading, in accordance with some of the Council's proposals, the budget increase is 1.4 %."
"It is a step, but not a sufficiently large one."
"We regret that an effort was not made with regard to structural actions, as well as agricultural expenditure and heading 3 and 4 expenditure."
"The commitment made in Edinburgh does not, in this respect, justify maintaining expenditure, which, we are perfectly aware, will not be made in the coming year."
"We also regret that the budget has not achieved a zero growth rate, which would have been possible, if the Council's budget had been followed."
"The increase in expenditure allows an increase in national contributions of 1.29 % compared with a 1.39 % increase in expenditure."
"If the French budget, for example, increased by so much, my country would not be able to comply with one of the important criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, the budget deficit criteria."
"Relative to the Council's second reading, the proposal from the Committee on Budgets represents an increase in the payment appropriations by around ECU 500 million, or just over SKR 4 billion."
"The actual payments are approximately unchanged."
"We are opposed to increasing payment appropriations, quite simply because (sooner or later) this must be taken from the national budgets, such as Sweden's."
"That means increased income for the EU leads to increased costs for the Swedish national budget, something which will ultimately express itself in cutbacks in Swedish public services."
"Even though the EU's expenditure is deserving (such as investment in employment), it will have the negative result of affecting the Swedish budget."
"For this reason we entirely share the government's objective that the EU's budget should be kept as tight as possible."
"We have particular reservations with regard to appropriations under heading 3 - internal measures."
"Parliament's first reading represents a large increase (almost ECU 600 million) in commitment appropriations compared with the Council's first reading."
"The increases relate to appropriations for an employment initiative (150), youth exchange and youth training (100), information (50), social measures (50) and culture and sport (20)."
"The almost ECU 600 million which makes up the difference between the Council's and the European Parliament's first reading includes an item for ECU 200 million which Parliament has combined with the ECU 150 million which has been proposed for employment."
"The European Parliament has also said it would leave this ECU 200 million unused on condition that the Council decides on a legal basis for ECU 150 million for an employment initiative."
"A legal basis is required to be able to pay out the funds."
"If the Council does not meet the European Parliament half way, it has said that it intends to try to spend the whole amount of ECU 350 (200+150) million."
"We think this attitude on the part of the European Parliament is quite wasteful."
"Since we do not sit on the Parliament's Committee on Budgets, it is difficult for us to influence the content of the budget."
"We have strong reservations about this budget, but we have chosen to show solidarity with our group and to vote for the draft budget in the final vote."
"As far as the budget resolution is concerned we are voting for Amendments Nos 3 and 4."
"We believe the European Parliament should set up a travel card, like the one which exists in the Swedish Parliament."
"We welcome the main priorities for next year's budget which have been set up with regard to the EU's new employment initiative and the employment measures of the Member States."
"We also welcome the proposal to introduce a new procedure for the EU's contribution with more open criteria."
"We are pleased to note the present proposal on setting up a separate budget item for environmentrelated measures for the Baltic Sea area."
"It is also gratifying to see that the proposed agricultural expenditure for the 1998 budget is going to fall compared with this year's expenditure level."
"However, this is not enough."
"We recommend a deep and extensive reform of the common agricultural policy."
"That is important not least in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU."
"We think, for example, that it would be wrong in principle to continue to subsidize tobacco growing within the EU."
"However, it is difficult not to notice the contradiction which governs EU's policy."
"On the one hand Community funds are used for the production of a harmful product with little market value."
"And on the other hand funds are used for measures against cancer."
"It is quite unacceptable to support a sector producing a product which damages public health."
"We shall therefore continue to press for an end to the tobacco subsidies."
"As far as travel allowances for Members of Parliament are concerned, we are working to change the current system."
"Earlier we presented proposals for a thorough overview of the system and together with other Members put forward an amendment aimed at replacing standard amounts with actual costs."
"In order to avoid misunderstanding we therefore voted for Amendment No 3, in the same spirit, even though it is not identical to our original proposal."
"We have voted no to the report."
"Parliament's first reading, which involved an increase of ECU 1.7 billion in payment appropriations compared with the Council's first reading, entailed an extra SKR 400 million for the Swedish treasury in membership fees."
"The increase in support for structural funds alone cost around an extra SEK 250 million."
"This increase remains in the Council's and Parliament's agreement prior to the second reading."
"The cutbacks which the Council has proposed are partly in heading 1, i.e. agricultural aid, and partly in headings 3 and 4."
"However, in the past agricultural aid has been overbudgeted and the surplus has been returned to the Member States."
"Thus the drain on the Swedish treasury caused by Parliament's first reading largely remains."
"As at first reading we question the efficiency of the methods of financing the employment initiative."
"At second reading of the 1998 budget we have acted largely in the same way as we did at first reading."
"Unfortunately voting is made difficult by the fact that nearly all the amendments are put into blocks, which means that people cannot express their dissatisfaction with individual items in the blocks."
"That is a shame."
"Within one block there may be both good and bad proposals."
"Furthermore, the majority in Parliament has once again voted down our proposal to reform the system of travel allowances (Amendment No 3)."
"The system which means that Members are able to stuff money into their own pockets can therefore continue. We are strongly opposed to that."
"It should go without saying that we Members should only be reimbursed for the actual costs of our travel."
"We have also voted against paragraph 11 which concerns 'a common information policy' , since experience so far has shown that the EU's campaigns are not objective and only express one side of the issue."
"We also voted against paragraph 12 concerning the programme for controlled thermonuclear fusion."
"The Danish Social Democrats support the proposal that the EU should give aid towards setting up an information centre for organic farming in the EU."
"Converting from conventional farming to organic farming is a necessary and natural development, which the EU should give high priority."
"We also believe there should be strict control of the money which is set aside for Turkey in the budget."
"We believe it is important that all 11 official languages should continue to have the same official status: so we support continuing to set aside the full amount for translating the debates of the European Parliament."
"We also support the idea that there should be more control of MEPs' travel expenses."
"Travel expenses should be reimbursed at the amounts actually paid, and we are pleased that we already need to furnish proof that trips were actually made."
"During this Parliament I have twice refused to vote for the budget because it contained not a single mention of support for bee-keeping in Europe."
"It was my way of protesting about the Commission's failure over the years to submit to us any proposals for a regulation or directive - despite the fact that this subject has been of concern to us since 1985 - for creating the legal basis for making money available in the draft budget for this purpose."
"In this respect the cat seems to have bitten its own tail."
"We made a unanimous request in Parliament for the support of apiculture."
"The Council of Ministers was able, quite justifiably, to refuse this since, as I have said, there was no legal basis for such expenditure."
"Now at last we have the legal basis we need, even though I would say that the mountain has only brought forth a mouse, since the regulation adopted by the Council of Ministers in June for measures to improve the production and marketing of honey falls far short of the unanimous proposals of this Parliament."
"What is more, the Commission even managed to do this by putting ECU 12 million less credit in the draft budget than it itself claimed its halfhearted proposals would cost."
"Well, that really is the limit!"
"As rapporteur, I have therefore been concerned that at least ECU 3 million more be allocated in the 1998 budget to promote the development of apiculture."
"I am grateful to our Agriculture Committee, our Budget Committee and also to the Luxembourg Presidency for the fact that the budget now has ECU 15 million, rather than ECU 12 million, for promoting the production and marketing of honey."
"It must be the first time this has been achieved in the face of compulsory expenditure, even if this represents peanuts compared with the ECU 65 million requested by this Parliament on the basis of my request for sound structural measures, including the pollination premium."
"It really is peanuts when one considers that we have money enough for all kinds of possible and impossible actions around the world, that we can reconcile ourselves to the misappropriation of ECU 60 billion, yet are simply incapable of making a trifling 0.08 % of our total expenditure available for vital activities. After all, did Einstein not say that without bees mankind would die out within two years?"
"For all this, I feel that I can agree to this year's budget with a better conscience, though not without affirming my continued intention to fight for proper aid and structural measures to assist our apiculturists."
"At this second reading Parliament is accepting the Council's proposal for the 1998 budget cutting a further ECU 1.1 million from spending on payments."
"At this second reading Parliament is accepting that the Council's final proposal for the 1998 budget therefore remains at a level of 1.14 % of GDP, the same spending level, when at Edinburgh in 1992, in the light of financial perspectives for the period 1994 to 1999, it had been decided that it should be increased to 1.26 % of GDP."
"Thus Parliament is accepting the continuation of an austerity policy merely in order to try to meet the nominal convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty."
"As Mr Tillich's report says, Parliament accepts the establishment of strict budgetary objectives, which meet the need to respect the criteria imposed for economic and monetary union and the single currency, by approving reductions in payment appropriations to levels below those proposed at the first reading of the budget."
"The budget still provides no complete solution to the problem of unemployment and social exclusion in the European Union today, with 18 million unemployed and 50 million people excluded."
"The ECU 150 million proposed by the Council for the 1998 budget after the Luxembourg summit on employment are no more than a palliative; the sums allotted show how important the subject really is."
"The Council has not even accepted Parliament's earlier proposal to allocate ECU 391 million as an employment incentive, although, as we said at the time, those were not additional funds but were transferred from other allocations."
"Parliament is now accepting the amendment of its proposal and will only be allowing ECU 150 million."
"We do not agree with that position, the less so because over ECU 100 million are going to be spent on information operations, and ECU 42 million are going to be made available for advertising the euro alone."
"It is also clear that the objective of creating budgetary savings to enable us to finance the costs of enlargement within the present limits of our financial perspectives, using the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposal as a framework, is still inherent in this budget."
"For all these reasons we are opposed to Mr Tillich's report."
"In this context, I think we should be pleased with ourselves for refusing to give the Council's proposal to cut ECU 1 billion from the structural funds a second reading."
"We are also pleased that some of our proposals have been included in this budget (East Timor, small-scale coastal fishing, the REPAS system, among others)."
"Mr President, my group voted in favour of the Giansily report although I expressed strong reservations about it yesterday."
"That is because we are very pleased that the House has shown a sense of political responsibility, although by a small majority, true, and one swallow does not make a summer."
"In recent weeks, great excitement has in fact been aroused by the rapporteur's proposal to re-establish the ECSC levy."
"The vote was contested, but common sense prevailed."
"Indeed, this House pronounced itself in favour, in a resolution of 21 April 1994, of the early abolition of the ECSC levy, in order to increase the competitiveness of the coal and steel industries, whose difficulties in all European Union countries are well-known."
"The Commission, usually unwilling to give up any resources, even recommended that it should be abolished, and we were going to maintain a tax, saying - what a surprise! - that it was the only Community tax in existence."
"In our eyes, that is no reason to keep it, in fact it is another reason to abolish it."
"The European iron, steel and coal industries already contribute, as does every other industrial sector, by means of ordinary taxation, towards the initiatives adopted by the Member States and the European Union, in favour of job creation."
"These industries are in trouble."
"The part-session was right to vote in favour of the amendment, which enabled the ECSC levy to be abolished forever."
"Thus, these companies will be able to make a useful contribution, at their own levels, towards the prevention of unemployment, and we will not have make their difficult situations worse."
"How can we fail to applaud that decision?"
"There is no way in which I can vote for this report, because it proposes the reintroduction of the production duty of 0.11 per cent for Member States."
"That means a further burden will be put on the EU Member States' membership fees."
"The economies of the Member States are stretched and they have more deserving expenses to cover."
"In Sweden's case cutbacks in nursing, care and education are currently taking place."
"There is no way in which I can support the absurd proposal made in this report."
"Sandbæk recommendation (A4-0379/97)"
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of this report today."
"We are against special directives for sportspeople, because sport can cover a lot of things, and children and young people involved in sport will prefer sports drinks to soft drinks; they can be half the size but contain the same amount of energy."
"Each sport has its own requirements, but the energy required can be easily met by using normal food and drink tailored to the individual sportsperson involved."
"Rules on special nutrition should only be issued if they are unavoidably necessary for consumers, which is why we go in for directives such as mother's milk replacements and mixed supplements for infants and young children."
"We do this because we want to ensure that food lives up to certain health requirements."
"We support the amendment that there should not be any pesticide residues in baby food, a proposal which the European Parliament passed at its first reading."
"Paasio recommendation (A4-0371/97)"
"To many societies, non-governmental development organizations, so-called NGOs, make a major contribution towards ensuring democracy, human rights and so on."
"It is therefore in Europe's interest to support these organizations; but of course we should be careful about who gets Community aid and why."
"On this point, it is very pleasing to note that the Council and Parliament agreed on most areas right from the start."
"The Council has adopted some of the constructive proposals which Parliament put forward at the first reading."
"So I can therefore give the report my full support."
"We should not be continually reinventing the wheel; instead we should be taking advantage of the invaluable experience and skills that NGOs have."
"The budget line for cofinancing with European NGOs is therefore important, and is a good basis for helping the developing countries."
"NGOs are normally happy with it, and it means amongst other things that NGOs from countries where governments do not approve large budgets also have an opportunity of working in developing countries."
"But in this partnership, it is important that NGOs retain their autonomy and independence."
"It may be added that if resources are not used up, this is not the fault of the NGOs' abilities or the number of applications, but because the Commission does not have the resources to deal with the proposals received from NGOs."
"This has the paradoxical effect that the NGOs, and also (which is even worse) the poor of the developing countries are punished because the Commission does not have the necessary capability."
"The change of personnel which the Scandinavian NGOs have seen, for example, means that any continuity disappears."
"In dealing with applications, the Commission should use experience from some of the national systems."
"For example, the fact that the Commission is slow in replying makes the job of the NGOs more difficult, and even prevents work being done."
"That is why the proposal to simplify the changes to the general cofinancing conditions are necessary."
"As far as the CSP (cofinancing support programme) is concerned, where NGOs in the home country appoint an organization or individual to screen proposed projects before they are sent into the Commission (to improve the quality of the projects), we are led to propose that this arrangement should be only temporary."
"We cannot have the NGOs doing the Commission's job just because the Commission is unable to."
"The CSP arrangement is mainly funded through the cofinancing budget line; and money used for advice cannot be used for good NGO projects which might help people in the third world."
"But, at the same time, the CSP scheme acts as a good consultancy function for small NGOs in particular and as such is essential."
"I would therefore argue in favour of the CSP scheme being retained but not financed via the budget line for cofinancing."
"Changes to the cofinancing line which provides support for the NGOs, that is, a sum of money instead of project-byproject support, are also welcome, but we must make sure that there is still enough money for the smaller NGOs which cannot handle this programmed support."
"Community project funding is normally limited to 50 %."
"This is a sound principle, that NGOs should be self-financing to some extent."
"But the Commission has had ideas about changing the interpretation of what form this self-funding should take."
"The Commission has taken it to mean that NGOs should collect money in their home countries."
"But such an interpretation creates problems for NGOs in Scandinavia and the Netherlands amongst others."
"In Denmark, for example, some additional financing is via government funds."
"The Danes find paying for development aid via tax quite natural."
"If Danish NGOs are to collect money for aid via collections, most people would have problems with that."
"Danes believe that the authorities raise money for the NGOs who do the work and that NGOs' independence is not threatened by DANIDA."
"If the Commission changes the self-financing rules and their interpretation, this would be contrary to the principles of Danish development aid."
"I support the Paasio report and the committee's amendments, which tighten up the Community's approach on a number of points - but not Amendment No 7."
"This calls for an advisory rather than a management committee."
"I am against the whole committee idea in principle, it is undemocratic and closed."
"But because of the problematic way the EU system is set up, especially in terms of the Commission's powers, I would rather see a management than an advisory committee."
"That would bind the Commission and ensure that national representatives are involved in the process."
"I am of course voting in favour of the section on openness."
"Giansily Report (A4-0409/97)"
"Our present debate has no particular national significance, at least not for my country."
"I shall, therefore, allow myself the luxury of addressing you in a language which those directly interested in the directive we are debating can understand in its full and plain directness."
"Those interested are mainly the European financial community who are today scoring an important victory insofar as they are having a longstanding demand of theirs satisfied."
"By means of the directive, banks and other financial institutions are given the opportunity to shake off the shackles, or what they perceive as shackles, of the regulatory authorities imposing on them minimal capital requirements for the sake of the security of their customers and for safeguarding the safety of the banking system against systemic risks."
"From now on banks and financial institutions, using sophisticated mathematical models of recent vintage will be in a position to estimate the market risk they bear and themselves assess the amount of capital to be earmarked against such risk."
"This new power banks and financial institutions can use for good or for evil."
"They are enabled to utilize their capital more economically and to better effect under their new freedom of making their arrangements."
"Alternatively, they are also put in a position to longer conceal desperate practices which banks, faced with failure, sometimes have resort to; when under the pressure of bad fortune or of an accumulation of mistakes they decide to go for broke, to use a popular expression."
"Against the possibility of such abuses no legislation can ever be totally foolproof."
"The directive contains certain safeguards and Parliament has added certain others, trying with great moderation and deliberation to balance the need for flexibility in business against due regard owed to the general interest."
"I regret that the industry concerned, judging from the quality of the lobbying to which it exposed us, has not given much evidence of either moderation or deliberation."
"This should not incite either Council or Parliament to deprive them of the latest tools of their trade."
"I hope, however, that the Commissioner will also pay proper attention to the safeguards and reasonable limits imposed by Parliament's amendment."
"It would be dangerous, on matters like this, for the industry to acquire delusions of omnipotence which might lead it to irresponsibility, for the financial sector to deem itself superior to the dictates of the real economy or for a government of money, by money and for money to become normal practice in this our European Union."
"Pimenta Report (A4-0325/97)"
"I can only support catching wild animals being done in a humane way, with no risk to endangered species or natural habitats."
"I therefore support the Commission's work on establishing a European hunting standard and regret that the USA, Canada and Russia are not immediately willing to sign an international treaty which ensures that wild animals are hunted humanely."
"I also believe, however, that the disagreements between the USA, Canada, Russia and the EU should not lead to a ""minor trade war' , but that we should strive for an amicable settlement without a dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO)."
"I have to agree with the rapporteur that this draft agreement between the EU, Canada and Russia is simply unacceptable."
"The three sides are at least talking about acting against these cruel animal traps."
"But such agreements must be tougher than this."
"They need to ensure the humane killing of animals which may be trapped but remain alive in terrible pain."
"The EU should insist that its own experts' view prevails so that the maximum time between trapping and the animal losing consciousness is 30 seconds."
"Just as we are moving to ban landmines which kill and maim so many of our own species, we have a responsibility to defenceless animals to get rid of as many leghold traps as we can, making those that remain as painless as possible."
"People who may still need to hunt for food no longer need to use such painful and archaic killing technology."
"And we cannot justify using cruel leghold traps to catch animals for their fur when alternative clothes can be manufactured."
"The many members of the public who ask me about animal welfare demand better than this - and the animals that suffer slow and painful deaths deserve better than this."
"EU negotiators should be told to fight on for a stronger deal involving more countries."
"Such a policy may not be easy, but like so many of my constituents, I believe it is right."
"Scapagnini Report (A4-0308/97)"
"We are strongly opposed to the report's proposals in paragraphs 2 and 3 for a supranational European energy policy."
"Supranational control would make the issue less clear in the democratic debate."
"Energy policy must be under democratic control."
"In its communication the Commission is seeking a common energy policy for the Union."
"It is questionable whether that is the most pressing measure in the area of energy in Europe."
"Giving priority to security of supply, sustainable development and long-term objectives for the environment and emissions are important starting points."
"We could achieve these objectives even more easily through a variety of energy sources which can broaden the supply base and at the same time still satisfy the sustainability and environmental requirements."
"This includes solar, wind and biomass energy."
"If a common energy policy is introduced, the Euratom Treaty should be abolished and replaced with a programme of environmentally friendly, long-term sustainable sources of energy which fit into the recycling society of the future."
"I am pleased to express my full support for the report drawn up by Dr Scapagnini, the Chairman of the competent Parliamentary Committee on the Commission Communication, which gives us a global vision of our policy and actions in the field of energy."
"This is only the beginning of that promised ""global vision' ."
"The document will certainly be amplified and improved in the near future, and I would like to encourage the Commission to do so."
"I therefore wish to refer only to the Energy Committee´s report."
"Firstly, I am sorry that there is still no section on energy in the treaties, including the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This means that we have no legal basis for getting started on that desirable global vision in the Union."
"The European Commission´s effort to be open, as demonstrated by the rapporteur, is laudable."
"That effort enables us to enquire which sources of energy protect the environment, create employment and improve the quality of life."
"Points 7 and 11 of the report deserve to be emphasized: the first, for its reference to the desirability of a political agreement on renewable energy sources and its explicit mention of natural gas as a possible ""long-term risk for the Union' ; and the second, because it highlights the ""desirability of giving priority to renewable sources' so that the priority in question can be given to the fifth R&D framework programme, which certainly was not sufficiently clear from the European Commission´s proposal."
"Point 12 also deserves emphasis, because it calls for ""financing over several years' which will make it possible to undertake ""significant actions' , particularly in the field of renewable energy."
"I therefore cannot help sharing the strength of feeling with which the rapporteur attacks the cuts - which I consider intolerable - in the budgets for energy programmes as useful as Altener, Save and Joule-Thermie."
"This is particularly absurd when the Commission has just completed a lengthy process by finally presenting us with White Paper on renewable energy sources."
"I heartily welcome the Commission's overview of EU energy policy and measures."
"This could help ensure a more coordinated EU energy policy in future, as energy and rising energy consumption in particular are becoming increasingly important at both European and world level."
"On the other hand, the report points to a number of areas where the Commission's proposals could usefully be bettered."
"First, the committee would like a clear statement by the Commission on the future energy policy's effects on the environment, standards of living and the quality of life in individual Member States; second, the committee wishes to emphasize the importance of the Commission doing more on EU initiatives on renewable energy sources."
"Mr Scapagnini welcomes the Commission's communication, with which I can only agree."
"The overview is useful and a contribution to more transparency in the field of energy."
"It is clearly intended to contribute towards more coordination of efforts for a better and more effective energy supply."
"In particular, I support the comments in section 9 of the report, which regrets the drastic cuts in the section of the EU budget on energy."
"But there are a number of points which I would like to criticize, especially grounds D and E. Mr Scapagnini is not bothered about dearer energy prices."
"I disagree totally."
"I believe energy consumption should be expensive, for both industry and individuals, for environmental reasons."
"Without a high price policy, energy saving measures will just be so much hot air."
"But my main concern is the highly positive view of the nuclear power industry in Europe."
"In section 11 of the report, the rapporteur wants to promote the Community institutions involvement in developing the nuclear sector because of the major role it plays in the EU's energy policy."
"These arguments are a good example of how the nuclear power lobby is out to win back ground."
"Now they play down the situation and say that nuclear power can be put to good use to reduce CO2 emissions."
"I believe that nuclear power should be rejected categorically now as it was before."
"As we know, it has other, unpleasant consequences and should be a footnote in the history of energy."
"In any case, conventional nuclear power stations use imported fuel (uranium)."
"Increasing use of this technology therefore merely shifts our dependence on the 'oil states' to the 'uranium states'."
"The cost of extracting uranium is imposed on aboriginal peoples everywhere in the shape of the inhuman effects of radiation which affect both humans and animals."
"Then of course there are the well-known objections to this technology, not least in terms of waste."
"Finally, I would like to point out that if we look at annexe 2 to the Commission's document more closely, it is striking to see what a ridiculously small amount is set aside for renewable energy compared with the figure allotted to the nuclear sector."
"This distribution is completely at odds with the political signals which are being sent out by Parliament's Committee on Environment and the political intentions expressed by many of the Member States."
"Despite these points of criticism, I have decided to vote in favour of Mr Scapagnini's report for the reasons I first mentioned."
"European Council"
"Mr President, the Luxembourg Council has slowly moved towards the affirmation of a truth which will be revealed at a later date, because at present it would sound too harsh to the ears of supporters of the super-state: an enlarged Europe would not be able to conform to the monolithic model which is already unsuitable for the fifteen."
"Paragraph 3 of the summit's conclusions reiterates that enlargement will necessitate the prior reform of the institutions, in compliance with the guidelines of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"What does the treaty say?"
"That at least a year before the twenty-first accession, a complete re-examination, and I repeat, a complete re-examination of the provisions of the treaties with regard to the composition and operation of the institutions, will have to be carried out."
"The words 'complete re-examination' show that this will not simply be a question of redefining the number of commissioners and re-balancing the distribution of votes in the Council."
"It will not necessarily mean extending the scope of the qualified majority decision as proposed by three Member States in a declaration appended to the treaty."
"But it is in fact significant that only three Member States are involved."
"It shows that all the others consider that extending the majority vote is hardly an appropriate solution to the growing heterogeneity of the European Union."
"So, what is the solution?"
"What should this complete re-examination consist of?"
"The conclusions of the Luxembourg summit show the way, and at the same time, constitute an experiment. A European conference involving the Member States and the applicant countries would provide a multilateral framework of political consultation and cooperation, particularly with regard to foreign policy and security."
"We have before us the outline of a pattern of differentiated cooperation, which will tomorrow allow all our eastern European partners to be flexibly included."
"Some belittle this innovation, suggesting that it means the organization of a transitional 'platform' for eastern Europe, which will facilitate the construction of federalism in western Europe."
"But they are wrong."
"For, when this interesting example of an experiment in free cooperation has proved successful, it will be difficult to contain."
"Mr President, the subjects covered during the Summit in Luxembourg serve one purpose: stability, security and peace."
"I am afraid I have to observe that, the Union's relationship with Turkey is not very reassuring as regards this stability, security and peace."
"Let me say clearly, Mr President, that Turkey is evidently good enough to defend the borders of Europe as a member of NATO, but there it ends."
"I find this attitude dangerous, destabilizing and unacceptable, the more so because the Union has in no way fulfilled its obligations under the customs union."
"Unfortunately, Turkey did not do so either."
"But it is in the interests of neither the Union nor Turkey to allow the relationship to deteriorate further."
"It is important to stop the verbal abuse on both sides, and to take a EU conciliation initiative, Mr President, before the United States, as usual, fulfils its responsibilities in this region, unlike the Union."
"First of all I would like to congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency."
"It has been a successful presidency and once again demonstrates the ability of small nations to undertake such a task."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has had many notable successes."
"For me, the most important have been the convening of the jobs Summit and the agreement on the enlargement process."
"With regard to enlargement, I am particularly pleased that the Heads of State responded positively to the views of the European Parliament."
"It was important to send a positive message to all applicant countries."
"In this way we prevent demoralization developing among citizens in those countries who would have been placed in a second wave of accession."
"Furthermore, by adopting an inclusive approach, we are also encouraging potential foreign investment in these countries and it should be stressed that this is critical if they are to bridge the economic gap between themselves and their future European partners."
"This truly historic decision brings to an end the legacy of the Cold War."
"However I am disappointed that a rift is developing between the EU and Turkey."
"I hope that this can be healed as I strongly believe that eventually Turkey will provide an important bridgehead between the EU and the Islamic world."
"Despite this setback it was nonetheless a successful Summit and provided a fitting conclusion to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted, along with the rest of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, in favour of the resolution on the Luxembourg Presidency."
"We would like to point out that Denmark has four reservations which keep it out of some areas of EU cooperation."
"At the same time, we believe that reforming the EU's institutional framework is not a precondition for the EU being able to start initial negotiations with the new Member States."
"It is with very great pleasure that I am voting in favour of this resolution."
"The EU summit in Luxembourg on 12 and 13 December 1997 took a historic step towards unifying our continent, which for decades has been divided and ravaged by bloody wars, violent dictatorships and poverty."
"The decision by the summit to initiate an admission process covering the ten applicant nations of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus ushers in a new era of European development."
"It is incredibly positive that the Heads of State and of Government of the EU are following the recommendations which the European Parliament passed by a large majority immediately before the summit."
"From a Danish point of view, I would like to emphasize how important it is that the extension should include all three of the Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, our neighbours on the Baltic."
"At the same time, I would like to stress the importance of the extension process covering all the applicant nations of central and eastern Europe on the same footing."
"The decisions of the Luxembourg summit mark a new historic period in the evolution of the European Union."
"Enlargement towards the countries of eastern Europe, without exclusions, that is, the ten applicant countries, including Bulgaria and Romania) and the priority given to the accession of Cyprus guarantees real European integration, putting an end once and for all to the divisions of the past."
"It is very clear that, in this perspective, only those countries can take part which respect and accept the terms and conditions and the regulations that have been set."
"Turkey is not one of those countries."
"Yesterday's words of praise for the Council, the applause for what has been achieved and the affirmations of the whole House all seem very strange indeed when one recalls the resolutions of this House in advance of the Luxembourg summit."
"Dissatisfaction with the meagre results of the Amsterdam negotiations, the call for an immediate introduction of the internal reform process, criticism of the Commission's proposal for Agenda 2000 and last but not least the request for a simultaneous process of negotiation for all membership candidates, now seem all but forgotten."
"The European Parliament's current resolutions are nothing short of self-censorship."
"However, even this coating of gloss cannot obscure the fact that the Council in Luxembourg has not succeeded in offering all applicants for membership real prospects for membership and negotiation - apart that is from the proposed and purely symbolic joint preliminaries to the membership process."
"This is justified by the claim that one should negotiate with the economically and socially most advanced applicants in the hope that the stragglers will eventually catch up."
"This shifts all responsibility for the course of the enlargement process on to the candidates themselves."
"Here economic arguments have to serve as a pretext for political despair, a policy which is all too common these days."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the future course of the enlargement process remains primarily a question of the EU's capacity for enlargement; the basic requirements for this are democratic and institutional reforms and a new structural and cohesion policy based on the principle of solidarity between the fifteen Member States and all applicants for membership."
"If we want to achieve the ambitious goal of a Europe with no east-west division, then we cannot agree to the Council's decisions."
"These constitute no advance whatsoever on the process outlined in the Amsterdam enlargement protocol, which itself is heading in the wrong direction."
"The risk remains that enlargement will be restricted to just a few countries."
"Now that federalist ideology has corrupted the concept of the border, no one dares to say where the geographical borders of Europe are."
"With regard to Turkey, the ambiguous developments at the Luxembourg summit, illustrate the disadvantages of allowing ideology to predominate over geography."
"By refusing to place their cooperation relationship with Turkey within a specific framework, not related to enlargement, and by instead assimilating that country with European applicant countries for accession, have not the fifteen, thereby adopting the same position as the United States, laid a trap which is likely to seriously affect the progress of the whole accession procedure?"
"When Turkey has been recognized as eligible for accession to the European Union by the Luxembourg summit, and called a major European State whose position in the heart of the European family is a historical fact, as Mr Juncker said here yesterday, how can the treatment of Turkey be dissociated from the treatment of central and eastern European countries?"
"Placing the discussions with Turkey in the centre of the enlargement process means, of course exposing ourselves to constant, recurring, systematic requests from Ankara, to benefit from the same provisions as agreed with central and eastern European countries."
"Not only do the fifteen not seem to have taken into consideration the projections made yesterday by Agence Europe, according to which in a few years' time Turkey will have a larger population than any of the fifteen countries, which, according to the new method of calculation envisaged for the distribution of votes in the council, would make it the country with the most weight in the Council."
"And yet, the fifteen have not seen, or have not wished to see, the risks the whole of the enlargement process will run, if they do not deal with Turkey in a clear and dignified manner."
"Our relationship with that big country, which is geographically outside Europe, is worthy of more than a specious sort of assimilation, pregnant with misunderstandings, blackmail and disappointed hopes."
"Ambiguous discussions are not responsible discussions."
"Commission programme"
"My explanation of vote will relate to an aspect of the Commission's work programme, about which the Commission, like the Council, in fact, is keeping very quiet."
"It relates to the new powers, of intervention and perhaps of sanction, with which the Commission would like to be endowed, in order to impose its very specific conception of freedom of movement within the internal market."
"As you know, this problem is in the news again as, on 9 December, the Court of Justice issued a ruling, which finds France guilty of having failed to respect the freedom of movement during the big demonstrations by French farmers in 1993 and 1995, during which trailers particularly those containing Spanish strawberries, were intercepted and smashed by French farmers."
"No one wants to know if those strawberries were not actually grown in Morocco, and labelled as Spanish, or whether clandestine Moroccan workers grew them in Spain."
"Whatever else may be wrong, goods must be free to move without restraint."
"I think it possible that demonstrations like those censured by the Court of Justice would not take place if the European Union had a right and proper conception of freedom of movement."
"But that question has not been raised."
"On the contrary, the Commission considers that the Court of Justice does not pass sentence quickly enough."
"It has therefore slipped into its latest single market action plan an allusion to the need to find ways of investing itself with the power to intervene in such cases, and even to impose sanctions."
"The Amsterdam European Council, last June, approved this action plan globally, without additional remarks."
"But it knew what it was doing, because the Luxembourg Council, on 13 December, has just welcomed, again allusively, a proposal, which has just been made."
"It is a draft regulation, tabled on 18 November, which refers to a mechanism of immediate intervention by the Commission."
"As there is no legal basis for such a regulation at present, its authors have decided to use article 235 of the treaty, which allows anything and everything, provided it is unanimous."
"We shall soon see which Member States allow themselves to be stripped by a handful of European civil servants of the right to control what happens in their own country."
"Very briefly to draw attention once again to the urgent need to establish a European policy on tourism, in view of the inexplicable absence of any such policy from the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This serious error is already producing its initial negative effects inasmuch as there is not a single proposal on tourism in the programme under discussion."
"I have said this so many times since the legislative process commenced, that I am sorry to keep on harping on the matter; but it still seems to me the height of irresponsibility that tourism, which among its other virtues is the biggest source of employment, is ignored in the Commission's work programme."
"The undersigned members of the Swedish Left Group have decided to abstain from the final vote on the resolution."
"The resolution contains positive wording in several areas, not least in its proposals in the environmental and social areas."
"However, the resolution also contains several paragraphs which we cannot accept."
"These include demands for new Treaty amendments, European parties and foreign policy."
"On behalf of the members of the European Parliamentary Labour Party I wish to record that we are supporting this resolution."
"However this does not mean that we are modifying our position on free movement where we believe, as was agreed in Amsterdam, that the United Kingdom's special geographical circumstances need to be taken into account."
"The Commission's Work Programme for 1998 is based on misguided political priorities."
"The European Union has failed to tackle the continuing problem of unemployment."
"Employment strategies should be the responsibility of national governments. National governments are best placed to understand the economic and social conditions necessary to tackle unemployment in their respective areas."
"Grandiose panEuropean schemes for tackling unemployment do not address local need."
"Achieving economic and monetary union involving the introduction of the euro is the Commission's main priority in 1998 and beyond."
"The strategy will be responsible for increasing unemployment as national governments continue to introduce unbalanced austerity measures in the hope of being admitted to the euro club."
"The absurdity of Commission dogma in pursuing its economic goals at any price has been recent demonstrated by its could not-careless attitude to the thousands of jobs which are under threat in the duty-free trade."
"The Commission also continues to take a dogmatic line in regard to what it calls ""Union action in the world at large' by persevering with a strategy which replaces the long experience of individual Member States in managing foreign affairs with the collective inexperience and amateurism of the European Union in this important field."
"I am opposed to all proposals aimed at tax harmonization because I think the citizens of the EU's Member States should have the exclusive right to tax themselves."
"Jové Peres report"
"Mr President, in my view the general lines proposed by Commissioner Fischler, which Parliament has now rejected for a number of reasons, were not acceptable."
"I would mention three of them: firstly, a COM is only reviewed when it is not achieving its purpose."
"This is not the case here, since the olive sector has been operating without any problems, with improvements in quality in recent years, and maintaining the growers' income."
"If there is fraud in any country, the Commission must fight against it."
"The second reason is that this is not a simple problem of maintaining income, which could be solved by a system of subsidies that does not depend on production."
"Furthermore, olive oil is a high-quality product, of which there is no surplus, and one that is competitive in the European economy. On no account should production of it be discouraged."
"And the third and last reason: in Andalusia, which accounts for 30 % of European and 20 % of world production, and furthermore has a major unemployment problem, olives are a crop with a high social value, using a great deal of labour, and have provided the rural population of an enormous area with stability and eliminated agricultural unemployment for many months of the year."
"Mr President, the report which has been approved today represents a good agreement for the olive oil trade."
"The tree subsidy option studied by the European Commission would be a tragedy for producers and the regions affected."
"The cost of harvesting the olive crop amounts to 70 % of the variable costs of the process, and a system of that kind could cause the abandonment of actual production."
"That would result in job losses in those regions, which have one of the Union's highest rates of unemployment."
"We cannot overlook the fact that the industry provides 46 million days' work for 400, 000 people at harvest time."
"On behalf of the Basque National Party, I should like to express our support for the producers, especially in Andalusia, where olives provide fifty per cent of agricultural jobs."
"In that respect we have acted in complete solidarity with our Andalusian friends."
"We therefore support this proposal for subsidies for actual production, because it will create more jobs, it supports the less favoured regions of the European Union and it will produce less fraud than the tree subsidy system, which is not transparent enough."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would remind the House of the element of risk involved in the tree subsidy system from the point of view of rural depopulation and the environment."
"Mr President, when the Council and the Commission approve the forthcoming regulation on olive oil in the next few months, they should very much keep in mind the employment potential of this product."
"They should be very well aware of the extent to which olive oil is a source of livelihood and business throughout the Mediterranean cultural area."
"This is very important, because we take too many decisions based on paper bureaucracy."
"If, however, we were there on the ground, we would see that the Andalusian olive harvest started a fortnight ago, and that, Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, completely neutralizes unemployment in Andalusia."
"You would see nothing but work going on."
"It is the best antidote to unemployment."
"There is no point in our holding extraordinary summits in Luxembourg."
"Let's join the real world."
"There is no unemployment in Andalusia at present simply because the olive harvest has begun."
"The Commissioner for Agriculture should include a socio-economic impact study in his proposals, and what he said yesterday about its parameters is not true."
"In his next proposal he should include the question of whether he is going to destroy jobs, because if there is one thing that has been made clear today, it is that we will not approve any proposal that destroys jobs."
"The Swedish Social Democratic Group has today decided to vote for the amendment proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"We have carefully considered the situation and have concluded that, in the voting situation in which we find ourselves today in Parliament, it is the best alternative."
"We welcome the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is working to achieve a compromise between the Commission and the producers."
"However, we think the Commission's proposal and willingness to reform are extremely important and we hope we can achieve deregulation within the olive and olive oil sector as soon as possible."
"The undersigned have voted for the report because of its criticism of the Commission's proposal and because of the olive sector's special circumstances."
"This does not mean we are giving up the demand that a general, thorough reform of the common agricultural policy should also include the olive sector."
"The question we have to consider today is a very important one."
"Firstly, it relates to the economic interests of southern Europe and that fact that the EU is the world leader in olive oil, with about 80 % of total production."
"Secondly, the olive is a part of the identity of the Mediterranean basin."
"Until recently, the European Union's system of aid for production and consumption has favoured large producers, although small farmers produce 60 % of the total."
"It has also contributed towards promoting quantity to the detriment of quality."
"If the system continues, it could lead to a risk of over-production, and in fact, to an increase in market prices."
"In the south of France and in Corsica, small quantities are produced, compared with our Italian, Spanish and Greek neighbours."
"Olive oil from the Provence region for example, is above all known for its quality."
"The reform, which is required, must enable small producers to benefit from a more favourable system of aid."
"The transparency of the aid redistribution procedures must also be increased."
"For that reason, it is becoming important to set up a new system of support, which will enable aid to be distributed more fairly, in a more controlled way, taking into consideration the role of the environment and the requirements of small producers."
"Integrating new criteria associated at the same time with the countryside, the environment and employment, seems to us a fundamental requirement of reform, which would be fairer to small producers."
"A reform of this kind must not ignore the new requirements of the World Trade Organization, and, in that respect, must evolve towards a system of aid for producers, which is not connected to production volumes and is adjusted in accordance with the principles of environmental protection and quality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to support a new system of aid and production control, capable of being integrated into the new system of international trade of the WTO, which will respect small producers and producers who, like those in the south of France, produce high quality olive oil."
"The vote this morning, concerning the WTO olive oil reform proposals, shows that you do not have to be a large political group for your amendments to be adopted."
"In fact, as you can see, all the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, were rejected, whereas four of the amendments of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations were adopted during the part-session."
"What is the purpose of this report?"
"At the beginning of 1998, the Commission is going to make a proposal for the WTO olive oil reform."
"There are some considerable differences in approach to this Mediterranean product, famous for its dietary qualities and effects on the health of consumers: some defend the European olive oil production policy, in order to protect Europe's position as world leader in terms of production."
"Others, on the other hand, would like the blending of oils to be authorized, which would destroy the intrinsic qualities of the product."
"As elected representative of the main French region of olive production, I, and the whole of my group, have at heart to protect the interests of French production, the particularity of which is that it is composed of a large number of producers who produce and market their own oil."
"In Mr Jové Peres' initial report, it was proposed that production subsidies (tree subsidies) should be withdrawn and replaced by consumption subsidies."
"At the time of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture, we were pleased to see that our position defending aid for production was adopted in the compromise amendments of the report."
"Finally, I can say that whatever its initial direction, this report has, during the various debates in the Committee on Agriculture and part-session, been redirected in the direction we wanted."
"That is why the whole of the Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of the final resolution and we await the Commission's new proposals with impatience."
"We hope that Commissioner Fischler will take into consideration the European Parliament's guidelines, the aim of which is to protect agriculture in southern Europe."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report by Jové Perez on the organization of the market for the olive and olive oil sector."
"The Danish Social Democrats support the Commission's proposals for a reform of the market arrangements for the olive oil sector, which provides for giving aid per tree in future."
"In our view, this is a more effective form of aid, and will help reduce fraud in the sector."
"We believe José's report is problematic because it is inconsistent."
"It says that the sector needs reforming, but at the same time it says that the present market arrangements are working well."
"To a large extent, the report supports the southern olive oil producing countries which are against a thorough reform."
"They are against the switch to aid per tree."
"The reform of the COM for olive oil is the first of the new reforms to come in the common agricultural policy."
"So it is important so support the Commission in its work towards new and effective reforms in agriculture."
"Thorough going reforms are needed in the common agricultural policy if the Union is to be ready to admit the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"We Spanish Socialists have supported the report on olive oil for one central reason: our conviction that the present COM has worked properly and has played a key role in the modernization of a sector of major economic and social importance."
"That COM therefore needs no more than superficial reform."
"We consider the final result, which has sprung from a compromise, to be a starting-point, which should not prevent us from continuing to insist on those points which we consider essential in the light of the final decision the Council has to agree on."
"These are the points in question:"
"Maintaining subsidies for actual production as the axis of the COM.-Increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity to around 2, 000, 000 MT, together with the necessary budgetary allocation."
"We would draw attention to the fact that there has been no increase in the EAGGF Guarantee in the COM since 1992, contrary to what has happened with most of the COMs, particular as regards Continental production.-We do not agree with the distribution of the maximum guaranteed quantity as between the producing countries."
"We would accept it only as the lesser of two evils, but we consider it necessary to insist that any share-out between countries should take account of actual production and the production capacities reflected in the most recent crops.-We will continue to defend consumption subsidies, as a contribution to the modernization of packaging and sales.-Maintaining the intervention system.Finally, we wish to reiterate our confidence in the future of olive oil as a key sector of Spanish and European agriculture, for reasons of quality, for environmental reasons, for social reasons and for reasons of rural development."
"Valverde López report (A4-0341/97)"
"The cultivation of tobacco is one of the most intensive in the Union as regards the labour force."
"It is carried on in small family-run agricultural smallholdings and in particularly disadvantaged regions, which, in the Community south, are mostly regions of objective I, which depend for the most part on this monocrop."
"It provides more than 300, 000 full-time jobs in the primary sector and in processing, and contributes to the protection of the environment and to the fight against desertification and depopulation."
"The reduction or disappearance of tobacco production, which would ensue from the proposed abolition of direct support for the tobacco sector in the Union (paragraph 29), would cause enormous irreversible social, political and economic damage to peripheral economies."
"It will not have beneficial effects on public health, given that it will not necessarily bring about a reduction in tobacco consumption, but it will benefit exclusively those multinational companies which produce cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco and which will dominate the global market, manipulate it and import into Europe at least 30 % of what it now produces."
"Measures are required to bring about a reduction in imports of tobacco products from the USA, a coordinated front to combat tobacco smuggling, an end to indirect advertising of large tobacco conglomerates, in parallel with interventions at a cultural and educational level, which will contribute to the fight against smoking."
"A positive step was taken in the vote against paragraph 29 which asked, in a frivolous and unacceptable way, for the immediate cutting off of subsidies for producers."
"However, paragraph 30, which has been approved, has a similar content."
"It is a great mistake to confuse the safeguarding of public health from the effects of smoking with tobacco cultivation, which covers only 30 % of European consumption."
"Finally, I was greatly taken aback by the fact that the rapporteur rejected my amendments against tobacco smuggling and for the non-participation of Members of the European Parliament in the publicity campaigns of large tobacco companies."
"I supported the Valverde López report warmly."
"The Dutch section of the I-EDN group thinks that every reasonable effort should be made to combat smoking in the Union."
"The Valverde López report makes a number of good proposals to discourage smoking."
"Thankfully the Council has now reached agreement on the advertising ban."
"Now for everything else."
"I have to get it off my chest that I think the continuation of agricultural subsidies for tobacco growing is an absurd kink in Community policy."
"I believe that the continuation of this subsidy is diametrically opposed to the Maastricht Treaty."
"This states, after all, that protecting public health must be part of all other policy areas of the Community."
"So it is time that the Union adjusted its support policy to the requirements of the new treaty."
"I have difficulty with only a few points in the resolution."
"They concern paragraph 13 on the tar content in rolling tobacco."
"Science is still not sure how the tar content can be measured in this kind of tobacco, as no hand-rolled cigarette is the same as another."
"A solution has to be found for this."
"That is why I supported Amendment No 2."
"Paragraphs 17 and 34 assume in advance that a higher tax on rolling tobacco is justified."
"This is premature, which is why I supported Amendments Nos 16 and 17."
"I was unable to support Paragraph 20."
"It seems somewhat excessive to give over 25 % of the packaging of large cigarette boxes to warnings."
"25 % is fine for a standard packet of cigarettes."
"Amendment No 13 therefore received my support."
"To conclude, paragraphs 35 and 36 seem to me to go too far, and I did not support them."
"It has been clearly established that smoking can cause serious illness such as lung cancer and cardiac problems."
"For this reason I would support any education or advertising initiatives that will dissuade young people from ever starting this bad habit."
"The report of Mr Valverde López has some excellent proposals in this regard."
"However, there seems to me to be a major inconsistency in the action of the EU."
"On the one hand the EU Commission and the EU health ministers support a ban on tobacco sponsorship. However, on the other hand, the EU continues to provide subsidies to tobacco growers."
"Where is the consistency?"
"Instead we should be encouraging tobacco growers to diversify and provide aid to assist them."
"To follow such a course of action would be more consistent with an anti-smoking policy."
"Tobacco subsidies from the EU must be phased out."
"A timetable should be fixed within which this should take place."
"During this time new crops must be developed and alternative ways of earning a living must be offered to those who can no longer generate their income from tobacco growing."
"It is important to find a balance between public health, employment, regional policy and a realistic transition period."
"The European Parliament cannot support the World Bank's practice of denying aid to tobacco-related projects without taking the same position in the EU."
"On behalf of Labour members of the European Parliament, I indicate that support for the Valderde López report on the present and proposed Community role in combatting tobacco consumption has been given on the basis of its status as a report on a communication."
"I believe that several aspects are more appropriate for action by Member States with a measure of cooperation."
"The UK government will publish its own views during 1998 and the UK parliament will deliberate on appropriate measures to be introduced."
"The Commission and Parliament proposals will be considered in detail if legislative proposals are brought forward, and the broad support of myself and colleagues does not necessarily indicate agreement that every measure should be introduced at Community level in future."
"Quite recently, the European Council, under the Luxembourg Presidency, adopted a common position regarding the prohibition of direct and indirect cigarette advertising."
"It therefore made haste, without waiting for the opinion of the European Parliament, so as not to defer this important file."
"The position of the European Parliament is above all motivated by public health considerations."
"As the rapporteur, Mr Valverde Lopez, reminded the House, half a million people die each year from the effects of smoking, in the European Union: smoking has become the main cause of avoidable death."
"At the same time, it is necessary to observe that the trend to stop smoking, which began a few years' ago, has reversed."
"Young people start smoking earlier and earlier, women are smoking more and more, with harmful effects on pregnancy and babies."
"Passive smoking, which was ignored for a long time, is more often the subject of scientific research which proves how harmful it is."
"From this point of view, and in the interests of public health, a total ban on direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products is a good approach."
"It is not a question of banning tobacco or its consumption, but of preventing young people from coming into contact (by means of closely targeted advertising) with smoking when they are too young, of trying to prevent the risks of passive smoking or the consumption of tobacco during pregnancy or in the presence of babies."
"Tobacco will still be sold in as many places as before, but the incitement to use it will be reduced."
"It is in this respect that I support the views of the rapporteur to the European Parliament and oppose all views, which support the liberalization of tobacco advertising."
"There is no doubt in my mind that tobacco is harmful, so I welcome the committee's report."
"If it prevents children and young people from taking up smoking and becoming addicted to tobacco, they will probably not get into the habit later in life."
"So I think the main effort should be on making tobacco less attractive to young people."
"The rapporteur is entirely correct in pointing out that the use of tobacco in public places and in the workplace costs society a huge amount, so I support measures which are aimed at improving health and safety at work."
"I am also voting in favour of the report for health and social reasons, even if it restricts consumers' freedom to buy tobacco as they like in some ways."
"Our group voted against the final resolution in this report."
"In fact, although we are very much in favour of controlling the use of tobacco, we cannot on principle accept the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection should vote for a report, which aims, at the same time, to withdraw aid for the production of tobacco, and aid for the export of tobacco and withdraws all the Community protection in that sector."
"I would like to remind the House that the priority aim of the Europe of Nations Group is the protection of employment: it is necessary to take into consideration the importance of tobacco production in underprivileged rural areas."
"In a number of production areas, it is not possible to replace the production of tobacco with any other agricultural crop."
"What will we do with the workers employed in this sector?"
"In addition, our group wishes to remind the House that the European Union still imports a net 67 % of the tobacco it uses."
"Withdrawing production aid, as well as having a very serious effect on employment, would increase our external deficit."
"What is the use of decreasing our production, if we replace it with imports from third countries, particularly the United States?"
"Indeed, if the European Union no longer produced tobacco, this would have no effect on the prevention of smoking."
"To conclude, our group is pleased that the part-session rejected paragraph 29 of the rapporteur's initial motion for a resolution."
"We regret that our amendments, justified by the protection of employment and the control of our external trade deficits, were not adopted."
"We have requested a roll-call vote and I think that tobacco producers will be interested to find out what positions various Members will adopt."
"I have voted for this report as I agree wholeheartedly that smoking is a proven health risk and should be discouraged."
"I condemn the UK Government's decision to allow Formula One to be given special treatment."
"The European Communication on the present and proposed Community role in combatting tobacco consumption was specifically to prevent exposure to young people."
"The government has distorted what could have been a very positive message for its own reasons."
"The UK Government's excuse has opened the back door to a whole range of opt-outs and challenges."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.49 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Madam President, I have the sad duty to make an announcement to the European Parliament concerning a tragic, catastrophic air accident which occurred yesterday during the night near my city, Thessaloniki."
"An aeroplane belonging to the Ukraine airline company, Air Swift, on its way from Kiev to Thessaloniki, crashed and was totally destroyed."
"All passengers and crew, 72 people in all, are unaccounted for."
"The aeroplane crashed in the mountainous region near Thessaloniki, following a failed attempt to land. The usual search and rescue efforts are now under way with little hope of finding any survivors."
"Madam President, I felt it was my duty to make this announcement and to ask the European Parliament to express its condolences to the families of the victims."
"Thank you, Mr Papakyriazis."
"This matter of course mainly concerns your homeland, but it therefore also affects one of the members of this Community."
"I am grateful to you for this information."
"It is something outside my experience."
"Parliament will obtain relevant information on this matter so that we too can demonstrate an appropriate level of concern."
"Outcome of the Kyoto Conference"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the outcome of the Kyoto Conference."
"Madam President, I simply want to say right at the very beginning that this House ought to apologize to the Commissioner for having brought her here to make this statement on a Thursday afternoon when there is nobody present."
"Some of us tried to tell the group leaders that it was not a good idea to have this statement on Thursday immediately before Christmas."
"I lost at that meeting; only one group leader in the Parliament agreed with me in fact."
"The Commissioner was in Kyoto last week."
"She came back at the weekend."
"There was an Environment Council on Tuesday and yesterday was the first day that she would have had to reflect on the results of Kyoto."
"Instead of allowing her time to reflect on future policy, we demanded that she come down here and make a statement."
"We ought to apologize to the Commissioner for this behaviour."
"We ought to have had a proper debate after Christmas when both she and the President of the Council could have been present and then we could have looked forward as well as backwards."
"As it is, some people who demanded the debate are not here at all, I think some of them are not even in Strasbourg by this time."
"That is absolutely shocking."
"I want to apologize for them to the Commissioner."
"I would like to thank Mr Collins, in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, for his kind words."
"However, as you know, Mr Collins, we have set an agenda and everyone has agreed to it."
"The Party leaders have presented this to us and no changes have been proposed."
"I understand what you say, and I know that the trip has been a long one; nor is it very easy to be right on top of the situation without any time for proper reflection."
"Madam President, I personally would like to welcome Mrs Bjerregaard here."
"Some of us were in Kyoto and we are all back here and it is fresh in our minds."
"So I would personally welcome Mrs Bjerregaard here for this statement."
"Madam President, as was stated by the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I recently came back, so that is also why I shall make the statement in English and not in Danish, because there has been no time for translation."
"Kyoto is over, and a protocol with legally binding targets for greenhouse-gas emissions is a fact."
"Everyone participating in the Conference was relieved when Ambassador Estrada on Thursday morning at 11 a.m., after a long night's work, closed the Committee of the Whole with a final text, which was formally approved by the Conference of the Parties later in the day."
"The Kyoto Protocol will prove to have been history in the making."
"I do not believe many of us present, if any at all, have been part of such a difficult and ambitious undertaking before."
"Let us take the necessary time to analyse and digest the result."
"But I am sure that you will agree with me that this is a milestone in international environmental negotiations."
"The potential implications for the global climate, for the economy of 160 countries and for the domestic politics of many major participants are staggering."
"It was a particular satisfaction to see how the European Union maintained its role in pushing for the strongest possible protocol throughout the negotiations."
"Even if the final result is less ambitious than our original target, there can be no doubt that had it not been for the continuous push by the EU one would not be able to claim any positive result at all."
"I believe the result is a positive one for the global environment."
"No agreement would have been a bad result for everyone, not least for our planet."
"We achieved an agreement which is worth having, and I worked hard for it."
"It is true that it is an incomplete agreement and that more work has to be done, but we now have a platform on which we can continue to build in our efforts to save the global climate."
"Let me say quite openly that there were many important players in the Kyoto process, including representatives of this Parliament."
"They played a key role in offsetting the unreasonable pressures brought to bear on the Conference by the US Congress and, perhaps more importantly, in building a strong bridge from the EU to the developing countries."
"The Kyoto agreement is, as is always the case with international agreements, on several important points an unfinished product."
"A number of provisions can only be finally judged when procedures, modalities and methodologies have been worked out and agreed in the coming year."
"Before I take a close look at the result, I would like to say a few words about the negotiation process itself."
"A lot of time and effort was unfortunately wasted on diplomatic positioning games."
"This was a disadvantage for the climate issue."
"The EU bubble, joint fulfilment of commitments within the EU, was subject to an unusually aggressive attack by the Japanese hosts and seconded by our US colleagues."
"This aggression climaxed in a formal proposal of an EU 'penalty' , for 3 % extra on the target in return for the joint fulfilment."
"A lot of negotiation effort had to be spent on turning this idea down, effort that could otherwise have been used constructively to improve the result."
"Let me add that it was clear that the attacks on the EU bubble were another way of attacking our more ambitious target of a 15 % reduction by 2010, a figure that certainly displeased most of our OECD partners."
"On the agreement itself, the most visible part, of course, is the reduction targets."
"The EU has argued for the same reduction target to apply for all Annex 1 parties, the so-called flat-rate approach."
"This line was supported by the United States."
"In the end-game, by far the majority of the Annex 1 parties, including the EU, associated member countries, the US and Canada and Japan found themselves within a reduction target of minus 6 to minus 8 % of 1990 levels."
"We pushed the United States and Japan as far as we could."
"We regret that we could not push them even further."
"In the end we chose a position of minus 8 % for the EU to take the necessary extra step for the environment."
"I very much regret that other Annex 1 parties were allowed a higher degree of differentiation, notably Russia and Ukraine, that were required only to stabilize, and Australia, that was allowed a possible 8 % increase."
"In addition, Australia was granted a provision to include in its 1990 emission baseline the emission from land-use changes as equivalent to industrial emissions."
"For these parties it is now a question whether they need to undertake any specific action at all in order to stay within their targets."
"Russia and Ukraine will, in all likelihood, find themselves major suppliers of quotas under a future trading regime in the protocol."
"I am sure you will agree with me that this is not an acceptable situation."
"During the negotiations it has become increasingly clear that the reduction targets themselves are only part of the story."
"The way we reach this target and the use of so-called flexibility measures are equally important."
"At an early stage of the negotiations the US made it clear that it was not ready to consider a protocol without possibilities to achieve a target through emissions trading and joint implementation."
"The EU has made it clear from the beginning that it was not against such 'flexibility measures' - in fact joint implementation was part of the original EU protocol proposal."
"However, such measures should provide for true costeffectiveness and not just allow for trading 'hot air' , the selling of emissions reductions already achieved."
"The agreed text is not very clear on this point."
"'Hot air' from the years before the first budget period cannot be traded - a very important point pushed by the EU."
"A proposed article on emissions trading was rejected and replaced with a very ambiguous 'skeleton article' - article 16 bis - which clearly foresees emissions trading but leaves all modalities open to be decided later by the Conference of the Parties, if possible at COP4 in Buenos Aires in November 1998."
"Joint implementation between Annex 1 parties is now part of the protocol (article 6)."
"Joint implementation with developing countries will be possible through the 'clean-development mechanism' , a new invention described in article 12."
"This new mechanism can be a very useful way of improving cooperation and transfer of technology between industrialized and developing countries but it will only become operational after the protocol has come into force and the parties have agreed on the modalities."
"The role of the developing countries in the future process was a critical issue during the negotiations, in particular after the US Senate adopted the Bird-Hagel resolution in July 1997 underlining that meaningful participation by the key developing countries within a foreseeable future would be a prerequisite for US ratification."
"The proposed article that would allow developing countries to voluntarily undertake commitments in the form of quantified emission targets was not adopted as part of the protocol."
"Resistance to this article was led by China which had been singled out in the United States debate on developing countries' participation because of the expected strong growth in CO2 emissions."
"On a per capita basis China is not likely to exceed 20 % of the US per capita emissions level within the next 20 years."
"Thus the Chinese resistance was understandable."
"This position was also strongly backed by India."
"Irrespective of the uncertainties linked to the various flexibility measures I have described, it is certain Kyoto put climate change at the top of the international environmental agenda."
"Further work is needed to create the indisputable success but I am sure that the momentum created in Kyoto will ensure this."
"This leads me to my last point."
"What will our next steps be?"
"On Tuesday I had the opportunity to discuss with colleagues in the Council how we might best proceed."
"The upcoming UK Presidency is very keen to assure a fast and efficient follow-up to Kyoto and this will certainly also be followed by the Austrian Presidency during the second half of 1998 up to the first Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires."
"We have no time to waste."
"COP4 is of major importance."
"Modalities, rules, guidelines for emission trading, joint implementation, clean development mechanisms, sinks, etcetera, have to be discussed there."
"Within 11 months from now the world will again have to take crucial decisions."
"The EU will again be ready to take the lead in closing all major loopholes included in the protocol."
"Our first task is to prepare for a signature of the protocol."
"A decision to sign should be taken by the Council in March 1998."
"For that purpose I have asked the Commission services to prepare a factual report describing our commitments under the protocol and the points that need clarification."
"The next step will be to prepare for ratification."
"This will definitely require the development of a post-Kyoto strategy, a Commission communication to Council and Parliament describing what action will be needed to meet our commitments and a proposed burden sharing."
"This communication will also have to address emission trading and joint implementation under the EU bubble."
"A final aspect concerns the question of when the protocol is likely to enter into force and on what basis. article 24 stipulates that only when 55 parties, corresponding to 50 % of total Annex 1 CO2 emission in 1990, have ratified will the protocol enter into force."
"The 50 % of CO2 emissions in 1990 is the critical factor."
"The United States accounts for approximately 35 % of 1990 emissions and Russia for roughly 15 %."
"This implies that at least one of the two will have to ratify in order for the protocol to enter into force."
"Since the United States is fundamentally dependent for their target to be met on emission trading with Russia it is not likely that the United States will ratify without Russia."
"Together with the EU this will bring the protocol into force."
"It follows from this that the United States or Russia has the main key to activate the protocol."
"The US administration has made it known that it is not ready to send the protocol to Congress for ratification at this stage."
"This seems to be due partly to meagre outcome of the developing countries' participation and partly to uncertainties surrounding the trading scheme."
"To facilitate US ratification it is crucial that the EU moves ahead as quickly as possible to maintain the highest possible political pressure."
"It will also be necessary to continue our efforts to establish a constructive dialogue with the developing countries, not because they should be pushed to undertake quantitative commitments at this stage but because it will be necessary to include them in the process to guarantee a long-term successful outcome."
"The support from the European Parliament is essential in the future as it has been important in the past."
"In this context I want to extend my particular appreciation to GLOBE for their impressive activity."
"It will continue to be necessary that you try to influence colleagues in Parliament from the respective main OECD partners and other main players."
"Better coordination between Parliament, me and my services should start right now."
"Your knowledge and your future presence in Buenos Aires is very important to make COP4 a success."
"Kyoto provided the platform."
"We are now starting to tackle the enormous task of reversing the upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions."
"We came to Kyoto to fight for the climate."
"We never expected it to be easy and it certainly was not."
"But it was a first step."
"We now must work to widen that platform to ensure that climate change is effectively addressed."
"I am sure that we can continue to rely on your support in this important task."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by directing my sincere thanks and congratulations to the Commissioner and to the EU delegation at the recent talks."
"This was a high point for European diplomacy which saw us taking the lead from the Americans for the first time."
"In fact, the USA was left sitting in the dock."
"Europe set the pace and those involved deserve our heartfelt congratulations."
"This is something which we should emulate whenever possible."
"At the same time, however, I have to point out that the numerous delegates from the European Parliament and the national parliaments who were present at Kyoto must cooperate more closely on this issue."
"In Kyoto we were completely fragmented."
"We were not even aware of one another, whereas the Americans had a very coordinated delegation and presented a very united presence."
"This is a task for the management of Parliament and indeed for the Commission, with whom we should cooperate more closely in this respect."
"This is really the first matter which concerns me, namely the ratification of the agreement by the US Senate."
"The Council of Ministers' resolution of 16 October for Kyoto stated that the emission reduction targets for 2010 and 2005, which we have resolved to introduce, are technically achievable and economically feasible, provided that other industrial nations introduce comparable measures for the reduction of emissions."
"What happens if the US Senate only ratifies the Kyoto agreement in two or three years time?"
"Does this mean that Europe can also wait two or three years, or even longer, or does it mean that we should initiate the main phases of the emission reduction process independently of the Americans?"
"This seems to me to be a key question for the Council. It naturally affects the Commission too, but primarily concerns the Council."
"The question which then arises is why we have not kept our original target of 15 %."
"Each of us who has been concerned with this issue knows that the Kyoto agreement is the result of a diplomatic deal."
"And if the climatologists are right, then we are falling well short of the requirements which have to be met."
"For this reason too I would recommend sticking with the 15 % proposal."
"It is one which will be supported by a large proportion of young people, as well as by those engaged in science and research, throughout Europe."
"From this commitment will grow a new European identity - one which is based on obligation, rather than on a lifeless agreement."
"My last request and proposal is that we should draw up a binding timetable - one which includes sanctions against those who do not keep to the obligations enshrined therein."
"To do this we would require a management committee."
"This might be based within the Commission, in whom I have every confidence, and should be capable of implementing the scheme as well as monitoring it."
"Perhaps we also need a kind of interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, such that each makes an appropriate contribution."
"I am convinced that the various parties represented here, and certainly this applies to my own group, would be prepared to convert these dead letters into a living project."
"Madam President, five years ago the world's governments undertook to ensure that the quantities of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere would be reduced to an acceptable level for our climatic system."
"In his impressive speech in November, and in his contribution of today, Mr Linkohr has underlined the fact that the issues tabled at Kyoto have fallen well short of this ambitious objective."
"If we assume that in the long term each citizen on the planet should produce equal amounts of CO2 , then we in the industrialised countries naturally have to achieve a much more substantial reduction than all the proposals discussed at Kyoto."
"The figure in question should in fact be less than two tonnes per capita."
"This becomes all too evident when one realises that a citizen in Tanzania only emits about one hundredth of the amount of greenhouse gases produced per head of the population in some of the industrialised countries."
"Everything discussed at Kyoto was therefore of modest proportions."
"However, I believe that politics is the art of the feasible and for this reason we were obliged to make compromises."
"The difference involved is therefore only a gradual one - whether we had succeeded in getting the EU's plan fully adopted, or whether we stick with the current compromise."
"There is absolutely no reason for defeatism because the EU's position did not win the day."
"On the other hand, it is a matter of regret that there were a number of exceptions to the general agreement."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission and the negotiators for having taken such a strong leading role."
"However, some criticism is also appropriate."
"This particularly concerns the fact that Australia and Iceland may be allowed to increase their emission levels."
"This is partly the fault of the European Union because, for various reasons, we have allowed some Member States within the EU to increase their emissions in the coming years."
"It is therefore hardly surprising that other industrialised nations will demand similar concessions for themselves."
"These countries, both inside the EU as well as outside, produce up to 50 times more greenhouse gases than Tanzania and many other developing countries, for example."
"My own country has always been at the forefront of the environmental issue, but here too I can be self-critical."
"In recent years Germany has failed to make decisive cuts in environmental emissions in the west of the country."
"German unity was a piece of good fortune, especially in political terms."
"But German unity was also a success for the environment, since it allowed inefficient industrial installations to be replaced by efficient plant."
"Unfortunately, this is a principle which cannot necessarily be imitated by other Member States."
"The situation in Germany was a special one."
"We therefore have a credibility problem, both inside Germany as well as within the EU, since even the latter has failed to reach its self-imposed targets with the resources currently available."
"The post-Kyoto era must therefore be a time for credible action."
"We must introduce a more efficient energy policy and provide real support for climate-friendly energy forms."
"I believe that we will then also have a better chance of getting further reductions adopted during future negotiations, quite apart from the fact that there are of course many reasons other than environmental ones, for us to be economical in our use of energy - and more particularly in our use of fossil fuels - since these are finite resources, and what is more, they are far too good for burning, seeing that they constitute important raw materials for many processes."
"We therefore have many reasons for getting down to the job at hand."
"Madam President, let me begin by offering Mrs Bjerregaard my well-deserved compliments."
"It does not happen every day that I extend these to her, so she should be pleased with them this afternoon."
"This is because it is partly due to the perseverance of this Commissioner that the European Union has been able to play a leading role in the Conference in Kyoto."
"Like most speakers present here this afternoon, I was also in Kyoto, and heard the Commissioner speak."
"A fine, resolute speech after the speech from the minister from the Netherlands, which prepared us so well for Kyoto during its presidency. The Commissioner deserves our appreciation."
"Because, as a result of the European Union setting out for Kyoto with its reduction proposal of 15 %, Japan and the United States ultimately agreed to much stricter reduction targets than they had originally intended."
"Neverheless, I believe the European Union should not stick to the global agreement made in Kyoto of 8 % as the target for Europe itself, but that we should stick to the minus 15 %."
"Only then the Union will be able to keep its leading role, and will be able to pull the other countries along with it in the coming years."
"An alteration also occurred in Kyoto; six gases rather than three were included in the calculations as part of the reduction."
"A thing or two will have to be revised."
"The Commissioner herself pointed to this."
"Burden sharing between countries in Europe has to be looked at again."
"My question is: when will the Commissioner make this announcement so that the decision can be taken under the British Presidency during the first part of next year?"
"Finally, Madam President, I am fully confident that during the British Presidency we will tackle this case as energetically as was the case under the Dutch Presidency."
"I have already pointed out that under this presidency the Council has had the opportunity to become a historic Council, resulting in the European Union receiving praise from future generations for having broken through an impasse in the fight against global warming."
"Madam President, it might be appropriate at this point to remind the House of our earlier intervention at the Kyoto Conference, when we stated that ecological and citizens' groups in general were asking for a reduction of over 20 % in the year 2010, in relation to 1990 levels."
"We also said, however, that the European Union's attitude, when compared with those of other countries - basically the United States - was the clearest and most forceful option to take in the face of climate change and in defence of the environment."
"We should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the European delegation on their vigorous defence of our positions."
"We must denounce the environmental policy of countries like the United States, which insisted that developing countries should reduce their emissions while they themselves continued at the same rate of development as at present."
"That is a totally unreasonable suggestion, especially if, as Mr Linkohr said, we take into account Mr John Kerry's statements that he would fight in the American Senate to see that this agreement on minimum emissions would not be complied with, because it was completely impossible for the Americans to change their rules of conduct as regards energy consumption."
"We agree with some of our fellow-Members who have already spoken to the effect that the European Union, which has suggested a 15 % reduction in relation to 1990 levels, should continue to suggest the same guidelines for reduction and that it should be an example to the world of how environmental issues should be dealt with."
"In view of the fact that in other matters, such as foreign policy or trade policy, the European Union does not have the independence it ought to have vis-à-vis the United States and other countries, we are delighted that on environmental matters the European Union has been a model of consistency in defence of the world's future."
"I believe there is still a long way to go and we shall continue to require cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"This is how we see it, and we shall pay close attention to events and will support the European Union whenever, as on this occasion, it consistently defends the future of the European Union and the world; because we believe that when the United States says it is unable to reduce its energy consumption levels, it is acting inconsistently with any concern for the future."
"Madam President, first I should like to restore the discussion to its real scale."
"We face the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world by 60-80 %."
"This is an immense challenge, when we consider that, for example, the number of car/kilometres is predicted to rise in the European Union by as much as 60 % by the year 2010; we therefore have a big job on our hands."
"But this aside, I wish to add my congratulations to those of my colleagues to the Commission and the Commissioner personally for the excellent work done in Kyoto."
"I hope cooperation between Parliament and the Commissioner will continue."
"Now we have to pursue a course of international diplomacy, in which national organizations as well as MPs will play an important part."
"We saw this very clearly in Kyoto."
"I was there with eight other Members of the European Parliament and it is my belief that we did our very best."
"But the most vital work to be done is here at home."
"I agree with my colleagues and my group insists that the European Union must continue to be among the leaders in this project."
"We must stick to our original bid of minus 15 % by the year 2010."
"EU industry is definitely prepared to meet this challenge."
"Energy-saving solutions are being developed and they will certainly have got an extra thrust from Kyoto."
"I am totally convinced that new technology can improve people's quality of life and create new jobs."
"This is also the model we must hold up to the developing countries, where we have not yet been able to make any great demands, as it is quite true that emissions per capita are far lower in these countries than in ours."
"Thus the European Union has a very great responsibility in this matter and a major task ahead."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have rarely, in the whole of my political career, seen so much intellectual dishonesty as last week in Kyoto."
"Everyone, be they American, European or Japanese declared themselves ready and willing to save the planet."
"In fact, everyone came to negotiate emission rights."
"Madam President, this is a disgrace!"
"The scientific community and NGOs had agreed that a reduction of at least 15 % in greenhouse gas emissions was necessary by the year 2010, in comparison with the reference year, 1990, in order to stabilize the greenhouse effect."
"Even the European Union had pronounced itself prepared to do so."
"What is the result?"
"The Americans, who create the most emissions in absolute figures and per head of population, finally agreed to reduce emissions by 7 %, provided that tradable emissions are allowed."
"The European Union will only have to decrease its emissions by 8 %, and Japan by 6 %."
"Madam Commission, please be brave, accept your responsibilities."
"Let us, in the European Union, undertake to make a 15 % reduction, on a voluntary basis, unconnected with the results of other industrialised nations!"
"According to your department's calculations, this target is quite achievable, both from an economic and a technical point of view."
"Let a show a good example in Buenos Aires."
"Let us also undertake not to trade the rights we have thus obtained, with countries who are not yet ready to substantially reduce their emissions."
"The system of trading rights, as established in Kyoto, is immoral and cynical, because it allows the worst to borrow from those who are only mediocre."
"Madam Commissioner, Madam President, we should not play such a dangerous game."
"Madam President, was the Kyoto Conference a success?"
"Opinions vary."
"Last week in her response, Commissioner Bjerregaard seemed disappointed."
"The EU environment ministers were relieved with the result which was achieved."
"I am inclined to agree with the environment ministers, and I am pleased with the positive tone of the Commissioner's argument, and praise her for her dedication in Kyoto."
"It was feared that if no one moved, there would be no agreement."
"The compromise which we have now is approximately the arithmetical average between the 0 % of the United States and the 15 % of the European Union."
"Not very elegant, but the maximum achievable and hopefully the beginning of greater things."
"The negotiations were difficult and complex, that much is clear."
"That is why it is a victory for the European Union that such clear percentages were laid down."
"It shows that amongst the industrial nations the start of an awareness has grown that herein lies a responsibility."
"I think that combatting global warming is one of the most obvious test cases of international environmental awareness."
"It is a major plus that even countries like the United States and Japan have now agreed to the reductions."
"We all know how strong the link is between economic growth and CO2 emissions."
"Even stabilizing of the emissions calls for strong measures."
"That is why it so important that all industrial nations set themselves reductions targets."
"The Union was blamed in the beginning for setting targets which it would not be able meet."
"I have to tell you that we also doubt the will to achieve this 15 % by the year 2010, yet this is necessary."
"In my own country latterly economic growth has been deemed more important than achieving reduction targets."
"In our view two things are therefore needed for the coming ten to fifteen years."
"Firstly, an enormous effort to employ the most effective reduction instruments."
"Secondly, to work towards a global awareness that things cannot go on as they are."
"We must aim for a new model for economic development."
"This is vital, based on respect for the creation and the Creator of life."
"Madam President, there are two ways we can look at Kyoto."
"We can look at whether the agreement was sufficient to save the planet and we can look at whether it was an important milestone."
"From the environmental point of view it is no news that the conference did not agree on the levels of greenhouse gas reduction needed to reverse the process of climate destabilization."
"However, as a realist I believe we should welcome what has been agreed as a very important first step on a long and rocky road towards reversing the trend in emissions by the major industrialized countries and recognize how hard it was to get that far and how hard the Commission and other parties worked to achieve what they did."
"Having met with the Americans in Kyoto, I found it rather shocking to see how absolutely opposed many of them were to reducing their emissions at all and it is a victory that any agreement was reached."
"The main problem will be whether the United States will ratify and of course this is not a foregone conclusion."
"In the meantime it is essential that we in the European Union remain committed to our more ambitious target of greenhouse gas reduction of 15 % and put our energies into the economic advantage for European industry in being ahead in the clean technology markets."
"We must also redouble our energy saving and renewable energy efforts; we should also engage in a debate."
"I think we should initiate a debate with China, Russia and India to see how we can help these developing countries and others change their trends."
"We should not wait for ratification before beginning the very necessary efforts on clean development mechanisms and the necessary transfer of technology with the developing countries."
"We will obviously need to analyse the text of the protocol carefully because there are a lot of important issues in the detail, such as emissions trading, carbon sinks, clean technology transfer and so on. I hope we will be able to debate follow-up action in more detail in the New Year with the British Presidency also present because they made an enormous effort at Kyoto to achieve the deal."
"I also look forward to debating the Commission communication at greater length."
"Climate destabilization is not going to go away because of what happened at Kyoto, and we have very serious work ahead of us during the next year to prepare for COP4 in November to ensure that we continue to move forward."
"Madam President, the results of the climate conference are discussed in today's edition of a major German newspaper, as has been the case in previous editions."
"This morning's lengthy article appears under the heading ""Climate politicians in a fog' ."
"The writer is referring here not only to a political dilemma, but also to a practical one. It is a dilemma which faced the Kyoto delegates and which underlies the main problem being dealt with at the conference."
"It is based on the fact that statements being made by climatologists are, to a large degree, hypothetical, while their forecasts are unreliable and often have to be revised."
"Environmental policy is in urgent need of accurate data."
"This lack of information is just as pressing a problem as the lack of action."
"Here, action and information are closely interrelated, since the extent and intensity of the behavioural change needed has to match the accuracy of the available scientific data."
"I therefore believe that we urgently need to extend the scope of our research."
"In addition to the continued application of model calculations, we need to expand our chronological and thematic thinking."
"Better prognostics require a more complex research programme."
"This will help extend the preferred model calculations used to date and will therefore help to control, complement and even qualify these models."
"We must realise that the intensity and speed of climate change is relevant for political decision-making, and even the human impact has to be specified in terms of time and space."
"If we do not constantly seek to relate research to politics, then the result will almost always be a loss in credibility."
"I have a second fundamental comment to make: If I accept that climatic changes are man-made, that they are caused by human actions, if I say that climatic fluctuations exist, if I say ""yes' to the idea, or consider it probable - and that is clearly what I do think - then I cannot deny the relationship which this has with energy policy, for example."
"I must then at least do an approximate calculation of the potential climatic effects of the global increase in energy production."
"Then I must also recognize that there is an increasing worldwide demand for energy and that the need and capacity for energy saving measures is limited to those countries which have sufficient supplies of energy available."
"Anyone who does not recognize this must have a rather provincial outlook."
"And those who do acknowledge it must also accept the various options available to meet our energy requirements."
"Those of us who seriously believe in the careful exploitation of our natural resources, and who do not wish to see major climate changes, cannot sacrifice any of the options to blinkered ideology."
"Neither can we do without energysaving products and energy-saving technologies."
"Nor without renewable energies, the use of hydroelectric power, solar energy, and not even without nuclear fission, Mr Tannert, provided that it is deployed responsibly, and the future application of nuclear fusion."
"To forgo any of these options for ideological reasons would, in my opinion, be downright stupid."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by congratulating the Commissioner on her determination in defending the position of the European Union in Kyoto."
"If the Commission had not stood firm, we might not have achieved the result which we are able to welcome today."
"It is not the result we had hoped for, but I agree with those who say that a weaker agreement is better than none at all."
"We were witness in our parliamentary delegation to the fixed position of our American colleagues, and heard the weak reasoning with which they sought to protect their own industry. I personally noticed a contradiction between delegates from the Mid-West who defended the old industries and the delegates from California, who like us, believed that the utilization of new technologies is a source of progress and new jobs."
"A great deal of questions still need to be answered."
"For example, the involvement of the developing countries, the trading of emission quotas, and how to include deforestation and reforestation in the calculations."
"The question also arises whether the protocol will be ratified by everyone, and more specifically by the United States, the largest polluter, and how it will eventually be implemented The Commission stressed this only a few minutes ago."
"There is no consensus yet, for example, on which alternative sources of energy might be suggested."
"We may fear that because of this the practical implications of the Kyoto protocol will remain limited."
"Moreover, international organizations are badly equipped to tackle global problems such as these."
"They lack material and human resources."
"Their legitimacy is weak."
"We are facing an enormous challenge and we need to work with the Union on this."
"Finally, Madam Commissioner, I would like to support the plea that we in the Union should keep to this reduction of 15 %, whatever the commitment of the other parties may be."
"The pioneering work the Union has done must be continued."
"Madam President, the outcome of the Kyoto Conference was disappointing."
"The climate agreement is neither one thing nor another."
"It will not prevent global warming, at best it will only slow it down, and we must assume that emissions will be reduced at most by 5 %, though we know that a reduction of between 60 % and 80 % is required in the industrialized nations."
"We are very disappointed that the EU abandoned its position on a 15 % reduction and in this respect we await a clear statement from you, Madam Commissioner, on whether or not you are now prepared to take the lead here and stick with 15 % in the future."
"It is incomprehensible that you allowed yourself to be beaten down on this issue, that you gave in to industry's moaning about competitive advantage, instead of seriously tackling the issue of how to solve our climate problems."
"Global warming is too important an issue to be dealt with at such a toddling pace."
"We now expect you to take real steps here, since we all know that it is not the summit debate itself which is important, but rather the actions which are taken as part of our everyday affairs."
"If you continue to procrastinate on this issue, if you are not prepared to contemplate an environmentally-friendly energy policy, the introduction of an eco-tax and even the reduction of road traffic levels, then you are demonstrating to the whole world that you were only play-acting at Kyoto and that the EU is not really serious about tackling the environmental issue."
"In preparation for Buenos Aires we are therefore pleading for the 15 % reduction and for the ultimate introduction of an environmentally-friendly energy and environment policy."
"You have done seriously little to bring this about, Madam Commissioner, for where are the instruments needed to achieve this reduction target?"
"This is what should be on the agenda, the means for real action, and not merely diplomatic rhetoric."
"Madam President, first of all, congratulations to the Commissioner."
"If you want to see how this world really works, go into the world of energy and see the vested interests."
"She has had that experience and so have some of our colleagues."
"If ever there was a justification for the existence of the European Union, our presence in Kyoto was that justification."
"Going as individual countries we would not have had the effect that we did have."
"Of course, as Mr Linkohr rightly says, in order to enhance our identity, we should stick to our ambitious targets."
"This is not a sacrifice."
"It is very good business because it gives us a competitive edge, lowers our costs and makes us altogether more successful."
"Why do the Americans not realize this, then?"
"Because the Americans look at the world through the distorted glass of the heavy vested interests of the fossil fuel lobbies."
"That means they cannot see the world clearly."
"They see the world in a way that does not show them the simple fact that saving CO2 emissions is a very good business idea."
"Nuclear energy is not the answer."
"Nuclear energy presents other, equally serious environmental problems."
"Secondly, from an economic point of view, in a privatized market, nuclear energy is not viable."
"The experience in my own country, the United Kingdom, has proved that."
"If you can name me one country with a privatized market which decides to build new power stations at this moment, I will give you a prize."
"You cannot."
"The answer lies much more in using energy rationally and in turning to renewable energy sources."
"Let me take you back to 1957, the signing of the Euratom Treaty, probably a good thing to do in 1957."
"Now let us think about 1997."
"What we need now is a treaty on renewable energy, a Eurenew treaty."
"Nothing is as strong and as exciting as an idea whose time has come."
"The time has come now for that idea."
"We need some legislation; we need a directive which will allow renewable energy sources to thrive in a privatized market."
"We in the Committee on Energy, Research and Technology are doing some work on that through Mr Linkohr."
"We are doing an own-initiative report."
"We need the rational planning directive."
"Originally that was called the IRP Directive - the Integrated Resource Planning Directive."
"Sometimes I think it has become the RIP Directive - rest in peace - because I do not know where it is."
"Of course we need to coordinate our work."
"Parliament has to coordinate with the Commission."
"The Environment Commissioner has to coordinate her work with the Energy Commissioner."
"Energy is 90 % of the problem in climate change."
"And we in Parliament have to coordinate our work."
"The Energy Committee and the Environment Committee both have responsibilities and should work together."
"I sometimes wonder whether we do not need a Climate Change Committee where we could concentrate on this massive problem facing our planet."
"I am very pleased that we have had this report."
"It does not mean because there are few people that it is not taken seriously."
"This will not be the last we hear of it."
"Commissioner, you will be back when this Chamber is very much fuller, when the whole of Parliament will show that the European Union is a big player in climate change."
"(Applause )"
"I shall be brief, owing to the confusion over speaking times."
"I should simply like to make it clear that our group, the European People's Party, like the other groups, believe that it is correct, as we agreed in November, for the European Union to keep its self-imposed target of 15 % by the year 2010."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, though the road to Kyoto has been a long and stony one, the outcome, namely the Kyoto internal agreements, has provided us with a ladder up which we will have to climb in eleven months, before we are ready for the next conference in Argentina."
"The climb will be a difficult one for the European Union, since we have a double load to bear."
"For one thing we in the Community have to set about changing the proposals which were made by the Commission, with an eye on the Kyoto proposal of three gases and 15 %, to six gases, which are now new."
"I too believe that we should stick with our ambitious target."
"We must also make a new proposal for the European bubble, which in my opinion should be retained, because I believe that it is good to have a joint model for the individual countries of the European Union and together to bear the burden of emission reduction, modernisation and the modification and renovation of our industrial society."
"If the European bubble is to be credible, we need a legislative process which goes beyond the mere coordination of individual national measures."
"But above all, we need this common European legislation to stop other countries using the EU bubble as an excuse for running an emissions trading business which saves them the trouble of making any emission reductions themselves, and this at the expense of developing countries who actually need their own reduction quotas."
"Madam Commissioner, I believe that we should also revise our existing legislation and policies so that they are in line with this objective for the reduction of environmental emissions."
"Other members have referred to renewable energies, energy saving measures and so forth, and to this I would like to add my own remarks. In addition to a new agricultural policy, we are going to have to consider a new forestry policy, especially if we are serious about tackling the problem of what to do with the credits which are to be made for reafforestation, and not to trail behind other countries but rather to forge ahead with our own proposals and initiatives."
"I believe that we must draw up international proposals which set out the next course of action and define the rules governing emissions trading and joint implementation; these rules should be clear, verifiable, reconstructible and fair."
"As well as offering my congratulations to those involved in the outcome of Kyoto, I therefore wish to express the hope that in the new year we shall all find the strength to accomplish the task ahead of the Buenos Aires conference, and I hope in all sincerity that here the support of Parliament will be called upon much more than in the past, for together we can achieve much more for the environment than we ever could by acting in isolation."
"Madam President, I would like to say thank you for the many positive comments which have been made."
"I agree entirely with Parliament that it is important that the EU continues to play a leading role in this field."
"Of course, that was also why, in the last phase, instead of using the same target as the USA, namely a 7 % reduction, stated that we were committing ourselves to a reduction of 8 %."
"What happens now that we will be analysing what the changed situation means."
"What will it mean to have the six gases instead of three, which of course is part of the aims we established, and which of course also led to the 15 %."
"A direct calculation shows that, if the reduction had been based on six and not three gases, the reduction would have been equivalent to 12 %."
"In other words, there is quite a lot which has to be adjusted to the up to Kyoto."
"So I can confirm here and now that we are getting down to these analyses, but, as Ken Collins has also said, we have not had a great deal of time to do so yet."
"I look forward to further discussions on this matter in Parliament."
"I also believe that I said in my first statement that we are preparing a communication which will give us a document which we can use as the basis for debate and reaching some joint results."
"So I hope that I will have an opportunity to come back once we have analysed the figures a bit better and be able to say how things are going with the targets we have set up so far."
"And so I understand we are united in the wish to continue to play a leading part."
"And let me finish by referring to what the coming British Presidency said at the Council meeting the other day, namely that we should perhaps stop talking about burden-sharing and start talking instead about possibility sharing."
"That is also what Mrs McNally was in favour of, and I believe that it is absolutely correct, that there are some unique opportunities here, including for European industry."
"Mr President, I would not only like to thank the Commissioner for being here, but I would also like to say to all my colleagues that I think it is usual for a Parliament which respects itself to make an initial political evaluation a week after Kyoto took place."
"In that sense it was quite right to discuss these issues now, and I regret Mr Collins' words at the beginning."
"Mr President, I did ask the Commissioner when we might look forward to the announcement."
"Can the Commissioner give a response to this?"
"Mr President, there were obviously some problems with the translation."
"If the question was about the communication, I have already answered it."
"We expect to have it ready by the Council meeting in June, or rather, we would of course very much like to have it before then, so it can be debated here in Parliament."
"We know we will be busy, and we are putting quite a lot of effort into making the analyses and putting this communication together, because there is not much time before we will be in Buenos Aires, and we must be properly prepared for the occasion."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-1042/97 by Mr Gunther and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the convention of Ottawa on a total ban on anti-people mines; -B4-1051/97 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the Ottawa Treaty on anti-people mines; -B4-1059/97 by Mr Carnero González and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the Ottawa Treaty on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction; -B4-1063/97 by Mr Hory and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the results of the Ottawa Conference on anti-people mines; -B4-1072/97, by Mr Cunningham and others, in the name of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the Ottawa Treaty on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction; -B4-1076/97 by Mr Azzolini and others, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on banning anti-people mines; -B4-1081/97 by Mr Telkämper and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the Ottawa Treaty on the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all drew a sigh of relief when the Ottawa conference showed that a moratorium was being set up to prevent the spread of landmines."
"However, this should not signify that we can now take a breather, that we can now relax our efforts, but rather it means that we have even more problems to tackle - such as the illegal trade in anti-personnel mines."
"Illegal devices have, for example, already been discovered in mined areas around the town of Vukovar."
"The second point I wish to raise is that we must be careful not to lump all non-signatories together, since this group also includes some countries, such as Finland, who operate a very strict monitoring procedure to ensure that no mines are exported from their territory to other parts of the world."
"I believe that points 6 and 8 of our resolution are of particular importance."
"It would constitute a major step forward if those countries who have not yet signed the moratorium, particularly the nations of Asia, could be drawn into a commitment to stop the export of these devices, so that the trade in landmines, and possibly even the illegal trade in such weapons, would no longer be supplied from these countries."
"The question which I wish to put to the Commission is therefore as follows: How do you view the likelihood of forcing those countries, with whom we have a cooperation treaty or suchlike, to introduce such an export ban?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, as you know, at the beginning of this month an important step was made towards a global ban of anti-personnel mines."
"What was unthinkable two years ago was signed two weeks ago by 122 countries: a total prohibition on the use, sale, export, storage and production of anti-personnel mines."
"Credit is primarily due to the non-governmental organizations."
"As you know, the coordinator of the campaign, Mrs Jody Williams, was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for nothing."
"In addition of course the Canadian government which fourteen months ago took the political initiative for a permanently high stake."
"Thirdly, the European Commission, Mr Commissioner."
"The Commission played an important role in the establishment of three joint actions in the context of common foreign and security policy."
"Fourthly, even this Parliament deserves a pat on the back."
"Hearings, two reports and numerous resolutions which not only spurred on the Council and the Commission, but also had a positive effect outside the Union."
"We all know this, but we need to hang on to the momentum."
"The real work is starting."
"First we have to see to it that the treaty is ratified."
"Three countries have already set a good example, but we need forty in order for to the Ottawa Treaty to enter into force."
"The Union must devote more energy to broadening possible participation in the treaty in to order to include more than 122 to 123 countries."
"I recall that the Development Council as far back as November 1996, indicated that the most important thing is, of course, support for mine clearance, which must go in particular to countries which respect to the ban on antipersonnel mines."
"This seems to me an important factor in conducting politics with third countries and with third world countries."
"The implementation is important."
"Ten years after coming into force, the supplies have to have been destroyed, and the minefields cleared."
"This is a big task which requires a great deal of effort, as well as a great deal of money."
"The Union, ourselves in other words, are the biggest donor outside the United Nations."
"But in any case I hope I may look forward to the new joint actions by the Council."
"To make sure that mines are cleared as quickly as possible, effective coordination between all international efforts is needed."
"I think it would be good if the UN played a role in this by, for example, setting up an International Steering Committee including the UN, the Union and obviously with a suitable role for the non governmental organizations."
"It is extremely important that we do not lose momentum."
"To achieve this, the NGOs - which, as I have said, have already been so crucial - will have to continue to play a role in the implementation and supervision of the implementation of the convention which will bring an end to immense suffering and a monthly death toll of 2, 000 victims."
"Mr President, we believe it is a matter for congratulation that 14 Member States have signed the Ottawa Convention, that Finland will probably not get through 1998 without signing it and also that several of the countries that have applied to join the European Union have signed it."
"Nevertheless, we believe that some kind of pressure will have to be brought on the United States, China and Russia to sign it, because they are the biggest producing countries."
"In our opinion the European Union should raise the subject of anti-personnel mines in its negotiations, trade agreements and bilateral agreements with each of those countries."
"We would also emphasize - as Mr Martens did just now - the need for over 40 countries to ratify the convention immediately so that it comes into force."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize the need to monitor compliance with the convention and provide financial aid for those countries which do not have the means to eliminate mines or help the victims of anti-personnel mines, so that in this way, just as it has in the case of the Kyoto summit we were discussing a few minutes ago, the European Union may continue to lead the world on matters which contribute so much to peace and the future well-being of so many people."
"Mr President, it is very encouraging and refreshing to be able to stand up in this House and say that we have some results from our labours - that we see some progress."
"I look around the Chamber and I see one or two Members who helped to found the All-Party Campaign Against Landmines some time ago, when I was a new Member of this Parliament."
"We have seen a lot of progress made."
"When the European Parliament has played a role in this peace process, we should be able to trumpet it about and perhaps take our minds off some of the negative publicity about trivia that we sometimes have to endure."
"We should also congratulate Ireland on being the first of our Member States to ratify the treaty."
"Also, we should congratulate Mauritius - where some of us hope to go shortly on Parliamentary business - and Canada for leading the way."
"These are all very welcome developments."
"I also salute the eastern European countries, from Slovakia to Bulgaria, that are also hoping to join the Union sometime, for showing the way in this regard."
"All of this is very encouraging."
"What we need to do now, as well as keeping up the pressure on the delinquent countries that have not signed up, is to move positively into putting resources into mine-clearance."
"Here one sees some encouraging developments in the techniques of mine-clearance."
"For example, just last week in Scotland somebody invented a new system which promises to speed up the clearance of mines in a safe and cheap way."
"Similar breakthroughs, I know, are being made in other countries, including in Mr Cunningham's constituency."
"There are experts who are just waiting to be given the green light, so let us give them the green light from this House."
"I would also ask the Commissioner to be active in cooperating with other countries that want a coordinated response."
"In the resolution there is a very important point about avoiding the duplication and multiplication of organizations, but instead pulling together, so that together we can make a positive contribution to ridding mankind of this particular scourge."
"Mr President, could I also add my congratulations to the Canadian Government who brought all this about?"
"This particular fast-track approach - the Ottawa process - should be applauded and I very much hope that we will be able to use it on other occasions."
"I should also like to congratulate Jody Williams and the international campaign to ban landmines, in particular on winning the Nobel Peace Prize."
"I notice there are many members of the public here and I should also like to congratulate the public."
"When Jody Williams spoke in Ottawa, she talked about superpowers and she referred to the general public - civil society - as a superpower, because it was the work of millions of people throughout Europe and the rest of the world that brought pressure to bear and brought the result that we are all congratulating ourselves on."
"There are four things that we need to do."
"We obviously need to persuade those countries that have not signed, and in particular the United States, Russia, China, Pakistan, India - some of the main producers of landmines - to sign up."
"I very much hope that the Council and the Commission, in whatever dealings that they have with these countries, will raise the issue on every possible occasion."
"We also need to lead the way, as people have said, on ratification."
"The treaty will not come into operation until six months after forty countries have signed, but I am delighted that one or two European Union countries are in the forefront."
"Would it not be absolutely brilliant if the whole of the European Union were amongst those first forty countries which led to the treaty being fully ratified?"
"Thirdly on mine-clearance, we need a structured and coordinated approach, not just within the institutions of the European Union but throughout the international community so that what is done is done properly and wisely."
"I would like to see some statement of principle, some criterion, some yardstick by which this could be measured because I would like to think that the public money - the taxpayers' money - which will be spent on mine-clearance will be placed only with those companies who could guarantee, according to a statement of principles, that it would be spent properly, efficiently, wisely, and so on."
"Finally, we also need to do something about the victims of landmines."
"People have already said, there are something like 20, 000 amputees already in Angola; there are almost 10, 000 in Mozambique; there are just as many in Cambodia and so on, so we really do need to put more energy and more money into these rehabilitation programmes."
"Finally, just to sum up the four points, we need the treaty ratified as quickly as possible; we need to deal with the tens of millions of mines and the unexploded ordnance littering the world; and we need to deal with the problems facing the victims."
"We need to do all of these and we need to do them as speedily as possible."
"Mr President, the Ottawa Conference represented a first small step, a first small victory on the long road to a comprehensive ban on landmines."
"I think that the Canadian government should be congratulated on this achievement, as indeed should be Nobel Peace Prize winners Jody Williams and Thomas Gebauer of Medico International, who pressed ahead with their landmine campaign in Europe and who provided support for the Ottawa resolution."
"It is now a crime to manufacture, store and deploy landmines."
"We must intensify our efforts and work towards a comprehensive ban on such devices."
"Whether we call them anti-personnel mines, landmines or anti-tank mines, at the end of the day, a mine is a mine, a mine is a weapon and as such it is an inhuman and deadly device."
"It does not discriminate between a bus full of children or a tank."
"For this reason, all mines should be banned."
"In the wake of the Canadian conference the EU Member States must now ratify the Ottawa Treaty, implement its provisions as soon as possible and urge the USA, Russia, China and India to do the same."
"In closing let me point out that further measures are needed in this respect and that funds must be provided for rehabilitation."
"The Member States themselves should take steps to ensure that no more mines are produced."
"To this effect we must make a commitment so that we are not subsequently obliged to spend money on curing the suffering which we ourselves have caused."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I would just like to say a couple of words on this important matter."
"Our feelings, mine and my colleagues in the Alleanza Nazionale, are fairly contradictory at the moment because, while we have accepted the conclusions of the Ottawa summit and the treaty incorporating the requests made by our Parliament, a treaty relating to an international instrument that imposes a total prohibition on anti-personnel mines and the undertaking that the signatory companies will not use them under any circumstances, and while pleased with the number of signatory companies, which is clearly higher than expectations, at the same time we can only criticize the position of those states, including in particular the United States, Russia, China and India, which persist in not signing the Treaty and continue to produce and sell this horrible instrument of death."
"We therefore ask for strong political pressure to be applied by the European Institutions to those countries, so that they sign the treaty as soon as possible, and on the Member States to speed up the necessary administrative and legislative measures for the immediate inclusion of the regulations."
"Mr President, just like many others here, I would like to congratulate peace prize winner Jody Williams and the campaign organization for their successful work on convincing parliaments, governments and the general public to ban these terrible weapons."
"In less than five years they and the active members of the public have achieved the success of getting more than 120 states to commit themselves to banning and destroying these mines."
"The truth is that these mines are deliberately designed to disable people."
"An injured person requires medical care. The amount of explosive has been precisely calculated to achieve that result."
"That can be seen from the sales brochures for landmines."
"However, the result is not only that soldiers are maimed and killed, but that civilians, women and children also become victims."
"When the war is over, the landmines are still there."
"The war continues for the civilian population and the silent killers wait for their victims."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament, in anticipation of a total ban, has taken an early position to the effect that each Member State should ban landmines."
"Fourteen EU countries have done so, but regrettably neither Finland, nor the applicant countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have done so."
"I think they should sign up to the agreement on the banning of anti-personnel mines as soon as possible."
"A ban is not enough, however."
"All of the hundreds of millions of mines laid must be destroyed."
"To produce a landmine costs 3 dollars. To find and destroy it costs $ 1, 000."
"It is good that in its budget today the European Parliament has said that we should set about researching into this."
"It is also important, as several here have said, that we have effective international coordination, both of mine- clearance and of rehabilitation of victims."
"The EU can assist greatly in such work."
"But we as individuals can also contribute in fact."
"An example of this is what is happening in Sweden today."
"Our largest newspaper has got involved in a campaign for the victims of landmines and is collecting money to train mine sniffer-dogs, which are the most effective thing we have at the moment."
"I therefore call upon my colleagues here in Parliament to take the same initiative in their countries so we can rid ourselves of these terrible weapons for ever."
"Mr President, I have had the less than pleasant task of having to judge the government of a country whose citizens sent me here to the European Parliament."
"Namely, the Finnish government."
"For once, though, I have some relatively positive news to relate: this week in Finland a high level proposal came out which stated that Finland might at last prepare to sign the Ottawa Convention."
"This is reckoned to take place around the year 2006."
"Finland imagines she will require around another ten years' transition time to ratify the convention, but I believe that a major breakthrough in Finland has already occurred."
"Politicians will certainly do all they possibly can to get Finland to give up the use of all anti-personnel mines."
"The risk is that Finland will start to consider very expensive alternatives to these anti-personnel mines."
"I myself would rather Finland revised its view of the threat from the outside."
"I do not think Russia is any longer the enemy of Finland she was during the Second World War."
"Mr President, I think we would all agree that the Ottawa Process has been a great success."
"The Commission has congratulated the Canadian Government and, in particular, Mr Lloyd Axworthy for a really remarkable effort."
"Of course, the process is not yet over."
"There are many key states which have not subscribed to the convention and some practical problems remain."
"The Commission will take every opportunity to encourage countries that are not yet signatories to subscribe to the convention and I can assure Mrs Günther that we will certainly use the opportunities in relation to the countries she has referred to seek to persuade them to do so."
"In any case, the Commission will press for immediate export bans of the kind that are already in place in the European Union so that sources of supply to areas of conflict can be removed."
"The joint action of 28 November also introduces measures to implement a moratorium on the production of anti-personnel landmines and emphasizes the need, as has been stated by a number of speakers, for early ratification of the convention."
"Since the Ottawa Conference there have been opportunities to discuss with Canada and other leading contributors ways in which greater coherence might be introduced into the global effort."
"The European Union, along with other major donors and actors, expects to play a major role in achieving this."
"The suggestion of greater coordination which was advanced by Mr Cunningham is very important."
"We will strongly pursue the idea of an international steering committee supported by working groups in order to focus international efforts on the priority tasks."
"At the same time I would expect that the Commission contribution to de-mining and related research will increase during the coming year and I would estimate that over ECU 40 million will be committed, drawing on various budget lines."
"The Commission is grateful for the recognition that has been accorded to its own role in the resolutions."
"For its part, the Commission would like to pay tribute to the role of the European Parliament and those members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation who have campaigned tirelessly and with great commitment to overcome the tragedy of anti-personnel landmines."
"There is still much to be done; but we believe that there is still some cause for optimism; that with continuing commitment the worst of the problems, at least, can be overcome in the medium term."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-1049/97 by Mr Tindemans and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples' Party, on the situation in Burundi; -B4-1052/97 by Mrs André and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the warring factions in Burundi; -B4-1065/97 by Mr Vandemeulebroucke, on behalf of the Group of European Radical Alliance, on arms flows to the warring factions in Burundi; -B4-1075/97 by Mr Swoboda and Mrs van Putten, on behalf of the group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Burundi; -B4-1077/97 by Mr Azzolini and others, on behalf of the group Union for Europe, on the situation in Burundi; -B4-1085/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on arms flows to the warring factions in Burundi"
"Yet again we are compelled to raise our voices to condemn the atrocities committed in Burundi."
"Yesterday it was one faction, today it is the other; who will be the perpetrators or the victims tomorrow?"
"Massacres took place in Burundi in 1965, in 1972, in 1973; and between 1993 and 1997 they never stopped."
"Even Madeleine Albright felt compelled to speak about the errors made in Africa, albeit in notably hushed tones."
"What is the point of us recommending human rights and democracy if the conditions to achieve these objectives are not fulfilled."
"We rightly condemn the massacres in Burundi, committed, it says in the compromise text, by Hutu extremists."
"But we do not say, or no longer say, that in that same country the present leaders assumed power through a military coup after democratic elections had taken place."
"We rightly spoke of reconciliation and reform."
"But what are the chances this will be achieved when the balance between Hutus and Tutsis is extremely uneven, 85 % against 15 %."
"The latter minority has total control of the country."
"What will have to change, or can be changed in a peaceful manner?"
"That is why I take the opportunity to repeat once more what I suggested earlier."
"The United Nations must act."
"A reformed Trusteeship Council must become co-active in the administration of this country, and prevent two warring ethnic groups from massacring each other."
"An ongoing, cruel reality calls for bold measures."
"Diplomatic rhetoric amounts to hypocrisy in this situation."
"Mr President, Burundi has by now become a classic example of the destabilizing effect of arms supplies."
"A not insignificant report by Human Rights Watch shows that dozens of countries are involved in this trade, including three EU countries: France, Belgium and Germany."
"This has to be stated."
"This Parliament would be well-advised to proceed to explicit condemnation of these Member States' policies."
"Despite all our grand plans, like the code of conduct on the arms trade and joint action to combat the illegal small arms trade, the Member States continue to undermine existing policy."
"This has to be denounced loud and clear and incorporated into the discussion about the forthcoming Commission Proposals concerning European arms exports."
"As regards Burundi, the Union should argue for an international bilateral arms embargo and supervise proper compliance."
"The EU must also promote the reactivation of the UN Committee of Inquiry on Arms Trading."
"This committee of inquiry should then cover the entire Great Lakes region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union evidently has no coherent peace strategy with respect to the states around the African Great Lakes."
"This vindicates the alarming report by the organization Human Rights Watch on the situation in Burundi."
"The arms embargo turns out to be a complete sieve."
"Countries such as Belgium, Germany and France are mentioned, and accused, but those accusations are left out in the compromise resolution."
"On top of that there is the war mafia from China, Russia, North Korea, Azerbaijan, the Ukraine, and Bulgaria."
"African states are used unscrupulously as intermediate ports: Tanzania, Uganda, former Zaire, Angola, Kenya and even South Africa."
"I was one of the signatories of the draft resolution, even though the European States carefully deleted their responsibility."
"Yet the compromise is extremely important."
"A number of international actions are needed, including expansion of the embargo, not unilaterally, but towards both parties concerned, and I fully support Mr Tindemans' suggestion which states that what is happening here is pure hypocrisy."
"I would also like to see the establishment of a peace conference including all states around the Great Lakes, as well as the establishment of a regional agency for arms control with permanent military observers."
"But these are few suggestions in which we can merely co-participate."
"But to my mind the Commission could take more concrete action."
"I will give you a few examples: the drawing up of an arms trade certificate of true destination including the intermediate countries; bringing in UCLAF which is not satisfactorily involved, stronger checks on foreign pilots who have an EU Member State as their base, measures against shipping companies who violate the embargo and who should therefore be given a licence ban within the EU."
"I would like to ask, Mr President, for these things to be discussed during the ACP conference."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing the situation in Burundi, and some of you, even those on the platform, may be intrigued to know why the European Parliament is debating this issue at all."
"As has already been said, as with so many conflicts in Africa, we are very directly involved."
"As is the case with many conflicts, our involvement is not a positive one, but rather concerns the fact that our weapons are being used in that country for killing people."
"This means that in Europe profits and even jobs, let us be honest, are linked with the death of innocent people in Africa."
"I am pleased to see that there is broad agreement within this House for taking active steps to resolve the situation in Burundi and indeed in other crisis regions."
"The world will never be a paradise and there will always be weapons."
"But surely it is high time for us to stop supplying weapons to obvious crisis regions, to put an end to our support for such conflicts, to stop supplying the killing fields of the world."
"So my party is unequivocal is supporting this motion, namely an arms embargo, which must also involve on-the-spot checks to ensure that weapons are not reaching Burundi by more obscure routes."
"For this reason we naturally give our full and unreserved support to the restoration of peace through the medium of a peace conference."
"As well as restoring peace to the region, we must establish the conditions which will allow people who have lived together peaceably for decades to resume this way of live, instead of going for each other's throats."
"In all these matters it is imperative for Europe to act as the main peace broker, and not as a world power supplying weapons to ensure that conflicts are resolved militarily, through force of arms."
"Here I would ask that the initiative taken by the UK government, which is soon to take up the EU, be carried through to its positive conclusion, namely the so-called ""code of conduct' , which ensures that rules are established for arms exports, that these rules be made more transparent, and that they should more readily correspond with the concept of human rights which we have in Europe."
"With the permission of this House I should like to close by informing Parliament that a member of our party, who has prepared urgency debates through numerous discussions with other groups and who is very well known to the Parliamentary staff, namely Nadia van Hamme, is leaving us for Africa, although not Burundi, to carry out active peace work on that continent."
"In my official capacity I should like to express my thanks to her for the excellent work which she has undertaken in cooperation with other members of this House."
"Mr President, it is true that the problem with the resolution is that it remains weak; but it had one advantage, namely that it deals with an embargo which has to monitor both sides of Burundi, which points clearly to the fact that there is a serious problem with the Burundi army. One should never forget, after all, that it was this army which murdered a democratically elected president."
"As far the as the supply of arms is concerned, it is evident that it knows no ideological bounds."
"They come from everywhere. China, Russia, France;"
"Belgian firms are active. We support the embargo, but the question is, how can it be made effective?"
"On that front, too, the resolution is substandard."
"I would like to conclude with one remark, namely that if no political solution in Burundi is forthcoming, no embargo in the world will do its work."
"Besides, let us not forget that when push comes to shove, there is no need to import arms from abroad: machetes can be used for killing and murdering."
"Mr President, it is difficult indeed in the melee of Burundi, which is beset by civil war, attacks on minorities, tribal and clan feuds, to find the all-important red thread which would mark the beginning of a peace process."
"It would be easier if we could assume that all those involved were honestly striving to settle their differences without recourse to arms, but that is just not the case."
"We have had a quote from an NGO, which has been mentioned by three Member States and by my own in particular."
"I would like to say that I would be keen to check out this source, since no other country in Europe has such strict arms export laws as the Federal Republic of Germany."
"It is also important to distinguish whether this involves the equipping of police units, whose job is to protect the unarmed civilian population, or what the details of this report actually are."
"It is clear that even if our conditions were met, we are still unlikely to see peace in this region, so deplorable is the whole situation."
"Everybody will be deeply affected by the concern expressed by Parliament at what is going on in the Great Lakes region, in particular at the quantity of arms that are getting there and at the death and misery that these are causing."
"Speaking for myself, one could not but share the sense of frustration felt by Mr Tindemans, bringing all his considerable authority and experience to bear on this subject; the passionate call from Mr Swoboda to be active was also one that evoked a ready response."
"The Commission has considered in the past the possibility of action against the uncontrolled sale of arms."
"But rightly or wrongly, this lies within the competence of the Member States."
"They have shown all too clearly that it is a competence that they are determined to retain."
"Naturally the Commission would support any action taken by Member States or the United Nations to restrict the sales of arms in the region, but it should be borne in mind, such is the complexity of the issue, that even the present economic embargo imposed on Burundi by the neighbouring states, which includes an embargo on arms sales, is patently not working."
"The Commission agrees that the Organization of African Unity has an essential role to play in restoring peace and order to the Great Lakes region, which was confirmed by the Council when it decided last October that ECU 860, 000 should be allocated for logistical support to the OAU Conflict Prevention Mechanism to assist them in this work."
"It will not solve the problem in itself, but it is one of the limited number of practical acts - there were many calls - rightfully so - for practical action rather than mere expressions of concern - that can be taken by us."
"Furthermore the Commission continues to call on all parties to the Burundi conflict to start peace negotiations."
"Clearly the speaker who said that is the only solution is correct."
"We have informed the Burundi authorities again, looking at what we can practically do to encourage what others have to perform, that we will provide financial and technical help to set up a débat national , to restart rehabilitation and human rights programmes, and for any other useful measures as soon as there are real signs of progress towards peace in Burundi."
"So I share the frustration and anger that is expressed, but can do no more than state, in addition to that, the specific and practical action that we can take."
"I believe we are doing what is within our capacity and certainly are ready to consider anything more."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, as the sponsor of this resolution, with colleagues, we make no apology for raising the issue of human rights violations in Nigeria yet again."
"We do so following the decision by the Council of Ministers at the end of last month to extend for one more year the sanctions imposed on Nigeria."
"But what concerns us, certainly me, is an apparent softening of the Council's attitude towards Nigeria and Nigerian sanctions."
"It appears for instance that two or three Member States are now issuing visas to Nigerians to do business overseas, contrary to the Council decision as we understand it."
"Furthermore, many of us regret that Nigeria is to be allowed to take part in the Football World Cup next year, the denial of which could ironically have had more influence on the political situation in Nigeria than anything else."
"So let us be clear: the situation in Nigeria continues to be extremely serious."
"General Yar'Adua, a principal opponent of General Abacha, died in prison in mysterious circumstances."
"On the other hand, some western oil companies, in partnership with the Nigerians, are being denied sufficient funds by the Nigerian oil company to remedy environmental deficiencies in areas where there has been severe criticism."
"And I need hardly remind the House that Nigeria is sadly short of a democratic institution: , it lacks freedom of the press, no doubt freedom of speech, and there are many other issues besides - which is ample justification for the terms of our motion."
"Mr President, despite existing international pressure the so-called gradual democratization that general Abacha had promised, remains wanting."
"Mr Moorhouse referred to the mysterious death of General Yar'Adua, one of the opposition leaders, and I wish to refer to the sentencing of the Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinke who is living in exile."
"These are confirmations of an existing policy of infliction of torture, the arrests of journalists, and the repression of the Ogoni."
"It is a good thing that the Council has extended the sanctions against Nigeria by one year."
"It is a clear message, but as Moorhouse said, the sanctions do not go far enough, even more so when they are not implemented effectively, worse than that, when they are being undermined in an unacceptable way because they are evaded."
"The Union must look for instruments to monitor and enforce the sanctions."
"Furthermore, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the Liberal Group remains in favour of the oil embargo."
"It is the only way to punish this country effectively."
"Mr President, we seem to have had a whole catalogue of missed chances in the last few months."
"First of all the Commonwealth Summit in Edinburgh failed to take firm action against Nigeria; then the Council extended sanctions by only one year; and then, as has been mentioned, there was the failure to apply visa restrictions with Nigeria being allowed to play in the World Cup next year."
"All of these are failures on our part, as members of the European Union, and failures by the Commonwealth."
"So what is to be done now?"
"There is some slight gleam of hope."
"I was in Ghana recently with a mission from the European Parliament."
"They have shown that they can make the transition to democracy, and we are told that the Nigerians would like to be seen in the same light as Ghana."
"So we have to say to General Abacha that if he is serious, he can try to convince us of the return to democracy that he says he espouses."
"For him the message is quite clear: if he is serious about this return to democracy, he must free Abiola and the other political prisoners and return to the democratic process forthwith."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Brittan, I wish to draw your attention in particular to point 5 of the resolution, in which we call for the release of political prisoners."
"The list of names includes one Ogana Ifowodo."
"Let me tell you something about him."
"Ogana Ifowodo is a member of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, which is a German-based political group to which I myself belong."
"Mr Ifowodo attended the Commonwealth Conference in Edinburgh, at the invitation of our Foundation, in order to present the annual report of the Civil Liberties Organization from Nigeria on the human rights situation in that country."
"He was arrested at the Benin-Nigerian border on his return to Nigeria on 6 November."
"The Nigerian security police have so far refused family members and work colleagues access to Mr Ifowodo."
"There is therefore a risk that he has been tortured, or even that this is still going on."
"The security police have confirmed the arrest and the place of detention and have cited ""obstinacy' as the reason for the arrest."
"Of course, no such offence exists in Nigerian law, but presumably this refers to the real motives behind the arrest."
"The arrest itself is only one instance in a series of arrests of Nigerian journalists and workers from human rights organizations linked with the Pro-Democracy Movement."
"This attempt to silence all critics of the regime is clearly designed to pave the way to a form of democracy which will be controlled by the military government."
"Only this can explain the so-called charge of obstinacy."
"Commission Vice-President Brittan, we recently received a visit from Nobel Peace Prize winner Wole Soyinke."
"Talks were held in the Commission and in Parliament with Council representatives at all levels."
"I would like to put to them the following two questions: Firstly, what further steps can the Commission take, together with the Member States, to move towards an embargo on oil from Nigeria?"
"And secondly: the budgetary procedure now incorporates a new budget line."
"How does the Commission propose to deploy this new line?"
"Mr President, the most serious threat to consistency in international relations is the permanent temptation to be strong towards the weak and weak towards the strong."
"There is no doubt that the regime in Nigeria falls into the category of the strong."
"Strong not in reason, which is totally lacking, but certainly in military and economic power."
"Nigeria is a rich country where a large part of the population lives in conditions of total poverty, as the country's resources, particularly the income from oil exports, are used to keep a military clique and its loyal allies and servants in total luxury."
"Sanctions have rightly been taken against Nigeria for some time."
"However, we have still not taken the only decision that would really affect the interests of the regime: an embargo on oil exports."
"The list of crimes committed by the Nigerian system is now very long."
"From the bloody suppression of entire peoples, starting with the Ogoni, to assassinations, arbitrary arrests, torture, the disappearance of any political opponents, and the aberrant measures taken against the Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinke."
"The same arrogant refusal to welcome a delegation from the European Parliament in Nigeria in October, which wanted to hold a series of meetings and visits, that would not submit to the restrictions laid down by the regime, bears witness to the absolute desire not to take positive steps along the road to democratization."
"However, the electoral process used in the country is nothing more than a despicable farce, given that it is impossible for any opposition to take part."
"On this occasion too, the European Parliament has many requests to make to the Nigerian authorities."
"We strongly support all of them but we fear that, if the international community, starting with the European Union, fails to take the appropriate pressure measures, they will once again risk falling on deaf ears."
"Mr President, Nigeria is once more on our agenda as a result of the continuous violations of human rights and violations of democratic principles."
"Once more, because we have criticized this country many times before, but regrettably it has not really helped very much."
"In the meantime new reports come our way like the death of one of the confidants of Mr Abacha, who with forty other political prisoners was incarcerated in rough conditions in a prison near Enubu, 500 kilometres from for example health-care facilities."
"Amnesty International has informed us that the conditions were degrading, and it is no surprise that this eminent person, someone we had only just got to know of, died."
"It is a sad situation."
"It is the umpteenth drama in a long series."
"The time has truly come to step us the measures."
"This is the umpteenth time a drama is taking place in this country."
"It is also the umpteenth time we are pleading for firmer measures."
"We observe the contrary is taking place, because visas, which really ought no longer to be issued, are being issued increasingly."
"Our request to impose an oil embargo, is not being observed."
"Worse still, Shell, which has been reducing its activities in Nigeria, is being replaced by other oil companies, which are keen to fill up the gap left by Shell."
"We ask the European Commission to genuinely step up its measures."
"This has also been requested internationally."
"I think an oil boycott must indeed be unavoidable."
"I would like to know what Mr Brittan thinks about this."
"Sierra Leone"
"Mr President, during the June part-session, we censured the military coup in Sierra Leone and suggested the suspension of all European aid to the Freetown regime, and we were also surprised that Nigeria was entrusted with the role of gendarme of law and democracy."
"Since that resolution, the European Union has confirmed the suspension of European aid, and the Security Council has established an oil and arms embargo against Sierra Leone and has prohibited international travel by members of the junta."
"Finally, an agreement to return to democracy appears to have been reached between the junta and the Committee of Five of the States of Western Africa."
"That is all perfect, the recent developments, I mean, but this group would like to emphasize one point: what are our incitements to democracy worth if we do not choose to consolidate them by means of generous development aid?"
"The democratic process in Sierra Leone has been described as exemplary, but we have left that country alone to cope with a thousand and one economic and social problems caused, as is often the case, by too rapid a programme of a structural change."
"We therefore exposed Sierra Leone to a coup, which cannot fail to repeat itself tomorrow."
"As one African journalist phrased it: ' The West sells democracy, but it does not provide any after-sales service.'"
"Mr President, on 25 May sections of the Sierra Leone armed forced staged a revolt."
"They deposed the democratically elected President Kabbah and forced him to flee the country."
"This was the third coup d'état since 1992."
"The process of democratisation introduced by the civil authorities and by the rebels of the United Revolutionary Front in March 1996, which also led to the holding of free elections with several parties participating, was destroyed."
"The result, according to the World Food Programme, was a situation in which 200, 000 people were faced with starvation, while a similar number became refugees."
"The question which now faces us is whether or not we can and should provide immediate aid."
"And how could this be done?"
"I think that we should avoid assisting the military junta in any way and should instead support the demands of the UN Safety Council for the imposition of an arms and oil embargo in order to force the junta back to the democratisation process."
"Mr President, the population of Sierra Leone is experiencing disastrous times."
"After three coups the country is totally disrupted, its facilities for housing, education, and health care have been seriously damaged, and food supplies are extremely sparse."
"200, 000 people in the country itself are threatened with famine, as are 200, 000 in the north of Ghana and the Ivory Coast."
"When we were there recently, we found out how serious the situation was."
"Thankfully, the European Union does give some assistance in those camps, but it now looks like more help is needed."
"On that point we would like spur on the European Commission to take more political initiatives, particularly to support the tentative peace negotiations which have recently begun."
"I would like to add that in Sierra Leone there are Nigerian soldiers to keep the peace."
"Having only just heard what the Nigerians get up to in their country, and that these people come under the military authority of Nigeria, it is not difficult to imagine that they are not the best people to restore peace in that country."
"The European Union has a big job to do here."
"There are a number of proposals in the resolution. We support these warmly."
"Croatia"
"Mr President, our group, the Liberal Group, hopes that we will be able to give the Croatian government a clear and unanimous sign of disapproval."
"The Tudjman government undermines democracy and freedom of speech in many ways."
"Things are made very difficult for independent newspapers such as Globus and Feral Tribune; and non-governmental organizations such as the Helsinki Committee and the Open Society Institute are obstructed in their work."
"These are a few examples of the systematic policy of violation of international agreements which Croatia, too, signed, and violations of the rules of organizations of which Croatia is a member."
"Criticism from the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the Union are systematically ignored."
"I do not think President Tudjman expects the international community wishing to continue with Croatia this way."
"I only need to remind everyone that the American administration earlier this year pleaded for the suspension of Croatia's membership of the Council of Europe."
"The Liberal Group has also declared itself in favour of this."
"Each time we discuss the situation in Croatia, that the number of reasons for supporting this suspension appears to have only increased."
"Finally, Mr President, the Union must in the meantime devote itself to further development of democracy, free media and non-governmental organizations as part of the Phare democracy programme."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Croatia is without doubt in a difficult situation."
"After a war which has seen the repatriation of refugees, still tending towards nationalism, I can well understand why democracy has not been able to develop fully."
"But it is a matter for particular regret that unfortunately, as we witnessed during our delegation's visit, justified complaints are increasingly common that serious problems exist in respect of press freedom."
"Dealing with the media is never easy in any country, and certainly not in one which is in the grip of a social crisis."
"But it is because Croatia has avowed allegiance to the European ideal, and seeks a rapprochement with us - or at least that is what is being declared - that the European Parliament must be strict in its dealings and must apply certain criteria."
"After our visit I personally suggested considering whether we should provide more financial aid under the Phare programme on the basis of conditionality, when this suits Croatia and when Croatia takes active steps towards democracy, the integration of its refugees, and so on."
"I regret all the more that the positive responses which we as European parliamentarians tried to give are not really being met with positive reactions from the Croatian side."
"In this sense we naturally support the resolution and call upon Croatia to do everything in its power to develop a fully democratic State."
"Mr President, I will use my speaking time to express my support for the honourable gentleman and the other speakers."
"I think it is true that in this House we feel that we want and that we try to ensure that the European countries whose ambition it is one day to become members of the European Union respect human rights."
"We consider it therefore a gesture of friendship towards the Croatian people to remind them of their obligations, because in our eyes, they are the essential basis of the dialogue with countries which, I repeat, are destined to become members of the European Union."
"An important event has taken place today. I mean the arrest of two war criminals, in fact, two Croatian war criminals, indicted by the international court."
"This is an important signal, if that country wants one day, and I hope it will, to become a full member of the European Union, when it complies with the principle of respect for fundamental rights."
"It is in this spirit that we proposed this resolution, in the hope that the Parliament will shortly adopt it."
"Mr President, censorship is prohibited by law in Croatia yet intimidation takes place on a large scale; intimidation of independent magazines, independent journalists, independent organizations."
"The technique used is one the hand to summon people or institutions, and on the other hand to threaten them with financial compensations which are being claimed."
"Specifically at the moment, 100 cases are running against Globus, 45 against Feral Tribune, 32 against National, 51 against Novilus."
"There are 7 cases against Mr Cisak, the chairman of the Croatian Helsinki Committee."
"He is threatened with six months imprisonment."
"So this possibility is very real."
"These kinds of actions are all clearly politically motivated, these kind of actions."
"In that sense I regret that the words ""politically motivated' was deleted from the joint resolution shortly put to a vote, as demanded by the Christian Democrats."
"Because that is the crux of the issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Party supports this resolution because we too wish to assist Croatia in developing the type of society which we in Europe accept as normal."
"As far as the electronic medium is concerned, we soon expect to see a proper Croatian television service operating under public law."
"The sensitivity of Croatia's rulers to critical articles, both justified and unwarranted, which have appeared in various press media has often led to an over-reaction, and this we condemn."
"The new right of association and assembly is now in line with European standards."
"Foundations in Croatia can now exist quite happily under the new system."
"Only the Soros Foundation has problems with this, since it has now lost its former privileges."
"The Open Society Foundation is now also obliged to register as a foundation, and it is unwilling to do so."
"It wants to retain its NGO status."
"There are more than 1, 800 NGOs operating in Croatia."
"What is needed is a regulative law similar to that which operates in the rest of Europe."
"These organizations have to demonstrate, for example, that they are there for the public benefit, that is to say that they are non-profit making."
"The bill to regulate humanitarian organizations, which is now before the Croatian Parliament, the Sabor, still has its flaws."
"We call upon our colleagues in that Parliament to make improvements by introducing amendments to the legislative process."
"We are quite confident that this will happen and today's motion will certainly help to support these efforts."
"Mr President, last night Dutch and American soldiers from the SFOR arrested two Croatians suspected of war crimes in the North of Bosnia."
"They are now in The Netherlands and next year will appear next year before the international criminal court of justice."
"A positive bit of news we might say."
"It appears that in Croatia itself the reports are little more negative."
"It appears that statutes of associations are abused, but when I listen to Mrs Pack, a different picture emerges."
"At any rate we find that the Helsinki Committee and Open Society Institute which have invested 30 million in the country, are not able to function openly."
"Journalists are taken to court."
"This is not what the Union had in mind when it recognized an independent Croatia."
"In many ways we have been too patient for too long."
"It is therefore time to raise the alarm, and to insist that the law is not abused and that the media are given free rein."
"Mr President, it gave me great pleasure to read the resolution before us here today. For it is the very newspaper for which I work which is being portrayed as the object of persecution."
"I know only too well that Globus is in fact one of Croatia's keenest opposition papers, that it criticizes the Croatian Government in a manner which would not be tolerated in certain other countries, even democratic ones. I know this because I have a lot to do with the editorship of this newspaper."
"I do not even consider it unreasonable that action has been taken against Globus, since I am aware of a number of democratic countries close to Croatia in which similar events have also been reported, where editors of certain newspapers have even had to resign because they have offended the head of government."
"I would just like to make one point. As Mr Swoboda has stated so effectively, Croatia faces enormous difficulties."
"The country has been destroyed by war and has a huge problem with refugees, which Croatia has had to accommodate in very large numbers. Yet for all this, there is no doubt that in this respect the situation is not all bad."
"I personally was present during the elections in Croatia, where I was following the efforts of the opposition parties, and I can say that these opposition groups were able to operate quite freely and even achieved real successes."
"That the outcome of the elections was somewhat different can be blamed on the electors, but not on the government."
"I make these comments only to point out that Croatia is a European State, that its culture is primarily European and that we are all keen to help that country in its current difficulties. This does not mean kicking it in the shins, but rather providing real support for the efforts which are currently being made there."
"That should be the real intentions of this House."
"Mr President, I will not approve the resolution on Croatia before us for various reasons."
"I would first and foremost like to remind everyone that we in the European Parliament are badly placed to get on our high horse regards Croatia."
"The great majority of this Parliament, after all, never even uttered one word of help to the Croatian population when, with difficulty and enormous risks, it pulled itself free from the Yugoslav straitjacket."
"Then, a few years ago, piles resolutions were not produced to dismiss and condemn the struggle for independence of these people."
"And I would also like to remind everyone that the European community institutions, including this Parliament, continued to defend the Yugoslav utopia to its dying day, until Germany was the only country the have the courage to chose the side of the Croatian people."
"Nor will I approve the resolution, as I refuse to put Croatia on a par with countries like China, North Korea, Nigeria, and so on, who are rightly admonished here."
"There is undoubtedly much to be improved in Croatia, but this country does not belong to this list or to those to be put in the dock."
"I should also say that I consider the calls in this Parliament today for absolute political free speech in Croatia a little hypocritical."
"After all, we adopt resolutions like clockwork in which political free speech within our Union is curtailed and rejected, for example, for anyone who questions the multicultural utopia."
"Under the guise of combatting racism, almost all Member States have adopted muzzling laws which punish free speech about this enormous, political immigration problem with penalties, fines, and with ineligibility."
"And equal access for all opinions to the media, which is demanded for Croatia, is a joke in most of our Member State when you belong to a democratic but right wing and national opposition, as I do."
"When I consider all this, I can only conclude that Croatia should perhaps refine its democracy, but really has few lessons to learn from this Parliament."
"Albania"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, my first point is as follows: There have been some problems with the translation of the resolution."
"My original German wording referred to a murder attempt in Parliament and this was translated in all other languages as ""murder' ."
"This of course makes a fundamental difference for us here, and an even bigger one for Mr Hajdari, who was attacked in the House, since he is still alive and was not in fact murdered, thank goodness."
"Furthermore, in some of the translations it seems that a connection has been made between my request, or indeed that contained in the resolution, that in collaboration with the European Council an observer be sent to the Albanian Parliament, and the aid which we currently send to Albania."
"In the German version it is quite clear that no such conditions have been imposed."
"Both issues must obviously be regarded at the same time, but they should not be regarded as interdependent."
"When I drew up this urgency resolution, I was unaware of just how pressing the matter would be, since a number of decisions were being taken in Albania, and primarily in the Albanian Parliament, which from our point of view we simply cannot accept."
"For example, a number of weeks ago a decision was taken for a time-limit which the Speaker of the Albanian Parliament imposed on the Constitutional Court."
"The Speaker said that if the Constitutional Court did not make certain changes, then it would be dissolved on 20 December of this year, that is to say in two days time."
"Parliament was therefore stating quite categorically that if certain things were not done, the subsequent appointment of judges to the Constitutional Court would be changed in such a way that this would only be undertaken in accordance with the political sentiment of the ruling Party."
"This is something which we cannot tolerate and I believe that those who are today opposing this resolution on Albania must themselves accept some responsibility if the Constitutional Court in Albania is illegally and undemocratically dissolved the day after tomorrow."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very unhappy to see that the PPE has taken a stance without consulting the other members of the delegation, and is even quoting the delegation as if there were a common opinion on this issue."
"This is simply going it alone and, Mrs Pack, I am very sorry that you have decided to depart from the route of cooperation which we were only too happy to travel."
"Mr Habsburg, and here I mean Otto von Habsburg, has said that the outcome of the elections was not to the liking of many of those taking part."
"This is the fault of the electors, not the government."
"But the course which you are adopting is now just the reverse."
"Because your sister or brother party did not win, but in fact lost, suddenly everything which the government there is doing is wrong."
"This is something which I totally repudiate and reject."
"My Party and I are not prepared to proceed with the form of non-cooperation which you have adopted within the delegation."
"You have not sought contact and have not convened any delegation meetings to discuss this particular issue."
"During our joint visit to Albania you even called upon the opposition to return to Parliament and to cooperate with it, something which was not part of your resolution."
"In fact there is not a single mention of it in the resolution."
"Your motion does not in any way convey the discussion which we had within the delegation."
"I regret this, for you are biased in criticizing only the government, or rather the governing majority, and are focusing only on one side, while ignoring all the other arguments which have been put forward."
"You make deadlines and then you postpone them, which makes it very difficult for us to take part in the delegation meetings."
"You are then not even prepared to try to find common ground on the Albanian issue."
"I regret this very much."
"I am also of the opinion that the quotation at the beginning of the resolution is incorrect and unreliable."
"I intend to petition the President on this matter."
"Mr President, Albania, perhaps more than any other country of the former eastern bloc, is the country that suffered the greatest isolation and whose road to democratization is the most difficult and most arduous."
"There is no doubt that what we understand by the rule of law is still facing many problems and, in this regard, the observations that have been set out in the resolution are based on information that we gathered when we visited Tirana within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Commission."
"However there is, I think, another dimension to the problem, which we must not ignore: Albania is trying to find its way following elections which were widely accepted and declared as such by the international community."
"The country has found relative peace and is trying to stabilize its economy in the wake of a huge scandal and it is also trying to stabilize its international relations."
"It has already been emphasized, and it is indeed true, that what is happening on a broad scale is the sweeping aside of political opponents, always following the Balkan model. In other words what happened before is being repeated conversely, only then, unfortunately, we failed to react."
"Mr President, I believe that if the European Union had shown less tolerance of the rather high-handed acts of the then government, the fate of that government might have been better. In any event Mr Berisa would not have gained the faulty impression that we would forgive everything he did."
"Of course this in no way means that we must now forgive possible violations of democratic institutions."
"But, by the same token, and so as not to appear one-sided, because I believe that none of us has any party preferences in Albania, we should perhaps give an initial period of grace to the recently elected government, which must be well aware of our position with regard to democratic institutions and, more especially, with regard to the independence of the judiciary."
"The observations set out in the resolution are not erroneous, but they are rather one-sided and I believe that they are somewhat hasty because, particularly with regard to the constitutional court, our information comes only from the Albanian opposition party."
"I am afraid that we are rushing things, Mr President."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group will vote against this resolution as, firstly, we oppose the idea expressed in the resolution as behaving like tutors in Albania and to see whether correct parliamentary procedures are followed or not."
"I do not believe this is the way to treat democracy in Albania, however unstable it may be."
"I think it is a pity, and this has been said before, but at the same time there was a clear exchange of views between Mr Swoboda and Mr Habsburg."
"I think it is a pity that the Group of the European People's Party submitted the text too late, because it is usual in this House to not do so when it concerns urgencies."
"I think it is a great pity."
"I also have the impression that there are no urgent elements in the resolution and I would find it a great shame if we give the impression that we are voting against Albania, and that we are not concerned about the slow rate of improvement in democracy and rule of law in the country."
"In other words, Mr President, I think it a pity that hasty action by the EPP has in fact deprived us of the opportunity to produce a decent resolution."
"Mr President, I would like to express my surprise at both the content and the advisability of the resolution pertaining to safeguarding law and order in Albania."
"The European Parliament's delegation responsible for overseeing relations with countries of eastern Europe recently visited Tirana and, in my opinion, undertook an extremely successful mission to Albania, within the framework of the Fourth Intergovernmental Meeting between the European Parliament and the Albanian Parliament."
"I had the honour of being a member of the delegation of the European Parliament and, together with the other members, I had the opportunity to identify the complex conditions prevailing in that country and the enormous economic, social and political problems that it faces."
"I must point out that we did indeed identify many problems relating to the functioning of democracy in that country, but also the fact of the tenseness of the political situation due to the position adopted by the largest opposition party, which is boycotting the work of Parliament and does not take part in its sessions."
"I must also point out that our delegation made note of the responsibilities of both the government and the Democratic Party, led by the former president of the country, Mr Berisa, and that these interventions were considered useful by all sides."
"Given these facts I find it impossible to understand of what use this resolution can be, which I very much fear provides an alibi for the reasoning and for the tactics of Mr Berisa."
"I do not want to believe that these were the intentions of those who drew it up, however impartially this was done."
"With regard to the sending of an observer to the sessions of the Albanian Parliament, I would like to point out that Albania is nobody's protectorate, and that we must refrain from paternalistic conduct towards Albanian political forces."
"I call on Parliament to overturn the relevant resolution as unacceptable, since it undermines the role of our parliamentary delegation following its very successful mission to Tirana."
"Djibouti"
"Mr President, the legislative elections due to take place tomorrow in the Republic of Djibouti will not bring any great surprises, because the opposition does not have freedom of expression and even Members of Parliament for the ruling party are invalidated or declared ineligible if they criticize the President, Hassan Gouled."
"However, what seems exceptionally serious to this group today, is the repressive police cooperation between Djibouti and Ethiopia, both arresting each other's opponents and extraditing them so that they can be sentenced and imprisoned, as in the recent case of Mohamed Kadamy and his family and lawyers."
"The European Union cannot tolerate such practices on behalf of a country receiving development aid from the EU."
"This group would also like to indirectly address the French government, which likes to refer to a new spirit in its cooperation relationships."
"However, Djibouti is the main base of the French army in Africa."
"Whatever one's opinion of that military presence, we consider that it should at least be subordinate to a minimum of democracy, in the interests of France itself, which runs the risk of becoming involved in a political upheaval made possible by its very complacency."
"We are concerned about the human rights situation in Djibouti and are disturbed to hear of acts of violence against members of the opposition in advance of the parliamentary elections, which are due to take place on 19th December."
"On 26th September this year the main leaders, the representatives of the Front for the Restoration of Unity in Djibouti, or FRUD, were arrested by Afar, the opposition group, this including FRUD representatives who are active here in Europe."
"These persons were arrested in Ethiopia and then extradited to Djibouti, where they have been taken into custody."
"As well as the European representatives, those arrested included Mohammed Kadhamy and his wife, Aïcha Dabalé, who belongs to a humanitarian organization and who at this moment happens to be pregnant."
"We must emphatically call for the immediate release of these persons and for all those affected by the conflict to be allowed to leave the areas into which they have been driven, so that they can return to their homeland regions, if not directly to Djibouti itself."
"We should advocate that those dwellings which have been occupied by the government forces be vacated and restored to their former condition."
"As Vice-President of the Lomé Convention ACP Assembly, I wish finally to call upon Djibouti to comply with this convention, and particularly article 5, which states that basic human rights and freedoms should be respected."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, on the eve of the election in Djibouti, this Parliament is expressing its concern with the political developments in the country."
"Rightly so, Mr President, but there are other countries in the world where the situation is equally distressing and which this Parliament in its sometimes selective enthusiasm passes over."
"Such a country is Surinam, in the north of Latin America."
"A country with a population of 400, 000 people with 300, 00 relatives in The Netherlands."
"Mr President, in Surinam an economic drugs elite rules."
"Journalists and human rights activists are once again being threatened."
"Last week a photographer was kidnapped by four men and beaten up with the threat that the same fate would befall his child, if his wife, the editor of the newspaper 'De Ware Tijd', did not alter her articles to the advantage of the regime."
"Mr President, Christmas is approaching, political and media life will quieten down."
"At least I now know that the Surinam government is aware that this Parliament has been informed, and perhaps it will also protect the journalists a little."
"Starting with Nigeria, I would like to thank the honourable gentlemen for their questions, where the situation is certainly extremely worrying."
"Only two days ago the head of state, General Abacha, announced the creation of a new government to replace the one he dissolved on 17 November."
"The new ministers are being sworn into office today."
"The only question directly addressed to the Commission relates to the provision of a detailed report on the status of cooperation with Nigeria and the prospects for future cooperation."
"I can assure you that, as we did this time last year, we shall make available to Parliament such a report."
"I can already indicate to you that as of last week, a sum of ECU 326 million of 6th and 7th EDF funds foreseen for Nigeria has been decommitted from the last two national indicative programmes and virtually all EDF projects have been brought to an end."
"The only exceptions relate to regional projects, where one project in particular - a regional air security programme - has been allowed to continue because of its importance for the region as a whole."
"As for future cooperation, the Commission has not succeeded up to now in negotiating a mandate from the Nigerian authorities to mobilize some EDF funds for decentralized cooperation, as would be permitted by the 20 November 1995 common position."
"But we remain hopeful that we can do this."
"I would commend Parliament for its initiative in approving at this session a new ECU 3 million budget line for democracy and good governance in Nigeria."
"The Commission services will cooperate very closely with Parliament to ensure that these resources are used to maximum effect, but I cannot give any further details at this stage."
"Turning to Sierra Leone, since the military coup d'état in May of this year, the Commission, along with the rest of the international community, has been consistent in its calls for the restoration of the legitimate constitutional government of President Kabbah and in its support for the West African states that have been endeavouring to find a peaceful solution to the crisis."
"This position has been reflected in the four declarations put out by the Council presidency on behalf of the European Union."
"Support for UN sanctions imposed on Sierra Leone has also been expressed, and measures have been taken by the European Union to implement them."
"The Commission continues to recognize President Kabbah's government as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone and conducts day-to-day relations with that government in exile."
"During President Kabbah's visit to the Commission at the end of October, discussions were held concerning the type of assistance which could be provided to support the implementation of the peace agreement."
"It was agreed that support would be provided for the demobilization process and for the return and resettlement of refugees as mentioned in the agreement."
"The Commission is currently considering a request from a United Kingdom NGO for assistance to refugees in Guinea."
"Although all development programmes in Sierra Leone have been de facto suspended, it is also agreed that upon their resumption, programmes related to rehabilitation and reconstruction would be adapted to take into account the more urgent needs resulting from the crisis, such as housing reconstruction programmes."
"With regard to the humanitarian situation, the Commission has continued to provide humanitarian aid throughout the crisis and has recently approved a new package of mainly medical aid amounting to ECU 1.9 million, bringing the total for 1997 to ECU 3.7 million."
"Of course we must focus on the quality of the aid as well as its quantity."
"The Commission would like to point out that there are currently quantities of food aid from the United States blocked in Guinea, awaiting approval from the authorities there for its transportation into Sierra Leone."
"With regard to Croatia, it is clear from what has been said in this House that there are divergences of opinion and that there has not been a coming together of the political parties."
"There has been a tendency to polarize views with regard to Croatia."
"Having said all that, the Commission does share Parliament's concerns about respect for freedom of expression and association in Croatia, particularly with regard to recent laws and restrictions on the activities of NGOs and independent media in Croatia."
"In saying that, though, the Commission is not seeking to make any comparison between Croatia and any other country, but merely to express a view on particular acts."
"The development of improved relations between Croatia and the European Union depends on compliance with the conditionality of the regional approach, including respect for human rights."
"There have been some positive developments in some areas, for example, recent cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal."
"Nonetheless, the Commission is of the view that respect for certain human rights, on the other hand, has deteriorated."
"Until Croatia complies more fully with the conditionality of the regional approach, general economic and financial assistance through Phare will not be extended and negotiations will not begin on a cooperation agreement."
"The Commission provides support for civil society organizations and to human rights monitoring and advocacy groups in Croatia, with projects to the value of ECU 2.2 million in 1997 alone."
"Since 1994 the European Commission has also developed a programme of assistance for independent media in the countries of former Yugoslavia, including Croatia."
"So far in 1997 independent media projects to a value of ECU 1.67 including projects in the written press, for example, the Feral Tribune mentioned in the resolutions and Radio 101 have been approved."
"The Commission intends to continue giving support in these fields."
"With regard to Albania, the resolution is not actually directed to the Commission."
"Nonetheless I should say that the firm establishment of democratic culture in Albania remains a major problem given the heritage from the past, and that applies to the political parties, the institutions and society as a whole."
"In accordance with the objectives agreed upon by Albania in the international community at the Rome ministerial conference in October of this year, the government and the opposition both need to be pressed to strive for political normalization and there has been a positive signal in the form of recent media agreements between the ruling party and the main opposition."
"But it is the first half of 1998 which will be crucial because then we will see what progress is made with regard to the drafting of a constitution and the Commission considers that the participation of the opposition, in particular the democratic party in parliament and in the constitutional committee of parliament is essential for political normalization and for democracy."
"Finally with regard to Djibouti, the Commission has taken note of the proposed resolutions and will confirm first that we are following closely developments there and are aware of the reports of opponents of the government having fallen victim to human rights violations."
"We fully share the honourable Member's concern at these events."
"The Commission certainly is in favour of any initiative which could lead the government to act in accordance with democratic practice and could ensure that the general election scheduled for tomorrow is conducted freely and properly."
"Thirdly the Commission takes the view that firm dialogue with the Djiboutan government will encourage it to bring in greater democratization."
"Let us not forget that adherence to human rights is an essential element of cooperation under the Lomé Convention and the Commission, together with the Member States will have no hesitation in reminding the Djiboutan authorities of that salutary fact."
"The joint debate is closed"
"Mr President, my comments concern the urgency resolution under consideration."
"I am always for economy measures, but when I tried to get hold of the text of the resolution, as usual, I was given the joint resolutions - but not the original texts. The reason given was that this was a cost saving measure."
"This simply cannot be true, since joint resolutions are often rejected in this House, to the effect that one then has to revert to the original texts."
"I would ask for clarification on this matter."
"Thanks to the efforts of Mrs Pack, for example, the absurd motion on Croatia is now somewhat less so, yet I would still have welcomed the opportunity to read the absurd texts in their original form."
"I earnestly request that something be done to remedy this situation."
"Mr Posselt, I have taken note of your statement."
"It is true that there have been some translation problems, but as far as I know, the texts submitted to the vote and for your attention are available in all languages."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Human rights and democratization"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0381/97) by Mr Imbeni, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the report from the Commission on the implementation of measures intended to promote observance of human rights and democratic principles (for 1995) (COM(96)0672 - C4-0095/97); -the report (A4-0393/97) by Mrs Lenz, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on setting up a single coordinating structure within the European Commission responsible for human rights and democratization."
"Madam President, we cannot expect too much of our colleagues; it has been a very tiring week and, consequently, it is more than understandable that our debate is certainly constructive now, though it has a certain reserve."
"Taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, I would like to start on a point we were not aware of when Mrs Lenz and I presented our two reports, the document approved by the Luxembourg Council on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"I would be interested for the Commission to tell me what is meant in paragraph 11 of the Annexe to the document drawn up by the European Council on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it mentions academic programmes within the framework of the 50th anniversary."
"If there is a framework of initiatives already drawn up, already consolidated, I would like to ask the Commission, and not just for myself, to send us this framework of programmes and initiatives; a reciprocal undertaking could be made by Parliament and the Commission because, along with the national initiatives for celebrating the anniversary (I again refer to paragraph 11), there could be cooperative and positive inter-institutional participation between the Commission, Council and Parliament."
"Having said that, coming to the actual report, I would like to make a few particular considerations that I believe should be made on the Commission's report."
"The first is this: we are on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"This gives us a special commitment, and naturally a special honour as well, particularly on the point of consistency: consistency between saying and doing, consistency to this strategic matter, the promotion of human rights, particularly to avoid those contradictory aspects that cause harm at times, to our image as well, which is the result of the very essence of the European Union, fundamentally based on universal human rights, on respect for them and on their promotion."
"Contradictions often arise - sometimes, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing - in some cases, the relationship between economic and commercial relations and the subjects of the promotion of human rights are not entirely consistent."
"I would like to say that, if we have to record one step forward on the 50th anniversary, we should do so in this direction: greater consistency of behaviour between saying and doing, to ensure that all contradictions are overcome."
"In my report, I emphasize the requirements for information: information not just for the European Parliament - which we do need but we are privileged and do have information, though certainly not in real time as we would like but fairly quickly - but for all the bodies operating in the non-governmental organizations, on committed world cooperation for respect for human rights, organizations, including small ones, not just the well-known ones, operating in individual countries that do not have adequate information in time."
"My report proposes that the Commission should use the new technologies more to circulate information on the measures taken by the Union for the promotion of human rights in the various countries of the world, so that anyone obtaining information can do so directly and in real time."
"The second aspect I wish to emphasize is that of efficacy."
"We need the Commission's delegations, country by country, to be able to provide us more clearly with the relationship between the initiatives conducted, the costs, the resources used and the situation of human rights in this or that country."
"In other words, we need to know whether our investments serve any purpose or not, whether the situation of human rights in a country has improved or worsened after our initiatives and our intervention."
"From this point of view, we need more appropriate information on the efficacy of our intervention."
"Then there is a problem of coordinating the initiatives taken by the various institutions."
"On this point, there is one factor that makes my report different from that of Mrs Lenz, which is a differentiation of instruments and certainly not a strategic differentiation of objectives, because anyone can see that there is a consistency and a very broad convergence between these two reports."
"There is a difference of interpretation on one point, however, with regard to coordination, to which I would like to draw your attention."
"It is good to set up inter-service groups within the Commission. I personally agree that it is good to strengthen an interinstitutional group, but my personal opinion is that Parliament is not a managerial body, that management falls to the Commission, that others are responsible for managing the policies and that we have the task of directing and controlling."
"If we are unable to perform our task of control, we should not fall back on the creation of means of coordination and execution seen by the Commission and Parliament, because, in my opinion, this is not consistent with the European Parliament's tasks of direction and control."
"This is a point of difference on which Mrs Lenz and I hold different opinions, opinions which we will certainly try to overcome with discussion."
"I would also like to point out the proposals made in my report on the idea of organizing a large conference once a year to check the programmes drawn up by the European Union on democratization worldwide."
"I think it was two months ago that we held a large conference in Brussels to check the development of the Tacis and Phare programmes."
"This was an important event because representatives of the countries concerned, i.e. the third countries, took part."
"To tell the truth, the presence of Parliament and the Commission was not very constant or conspicuous: some of us attended from beginning to end but there were only a few people."
"Our colleagues, however, MPs and representatives of non-governmental associations in these other countries, have told us of the positive results and the drawbacks."
"For example, they asked us what the relationship is between bureaucratic administrative expenses and expenses going directly to the execution of a project."
"This is a subject that also relates to the promotion of human rights."
"It would be interesting to know the difference between bureaucratic and administrative expenses and expenses intended for the promotion of human rights."
"It was a positive experience and I think that it could also be done to check the effectiveness of our measures with regard to democratization and the promotion of human rights."
"I will conclude by thanking all of you for your attention and by expressing my belief that, in the end, stimulated by this deadline of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, we can do something more and better."
"Just one final word: if the death penalty was at least mentioned in this document at the Luxembourg Council - I know there is a problem in one member country - we might have taken a concrete step forward in relation to all the resolutions of the past."
"Madam President, I can concur directly with the remarks made by Mr Imbeni and I shall also try to respond to his comments."
"A week ago we observed Human Rights Day and it has to be admitted that human rights are still being seriously violated throughout the world."
"On the other hand, institutions and organizations are increasingly taking up the mantle of human rights and this has caused something of a contradictory situation."
"The European Union should be one of the main institutions involved in providing effective and wide-ranging support for the cause of human rights, from individual projects to programmes promoting human rights and democracy."
"We began in the 1980s with Latin America, followed by the ACP zone and the developing nations. Now we have the Phare and Tacis programmes for central and eastern Europe and the Meda programmes for the Mediterranean area."
"With the backing of the Council and Commission, the European Union has laid down basic directives through numerous declarations made in this House, and it is now attempting, via treaties of cooperation and association, to implement a human rights and democracy proviso which will be a pre-condition for the said treaties."
"So far, so good."
"However, when one realises that within the Commission there are more than 15 departments, plus several external institutions - or satellites, involved in the administration and drafting of human rights and democracy policies, then one is hardly surprised to learn that the European Parliament has for years been concerned that these matters have not been organized in as coherent, efficient and transparent a manner as we might imagine."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam consolidated the EU's commitment to uphold freedom, democracy, human rights, basic freedoms and constitutionality and established that the Union as a body is obligated to the principle of coherency in its foreign policy."
"Council and Commission share this responsibility and the Commission has followed this up by submitting to the Council a proposal for a uniform legal structure which will serve as a framework for human rights and democracy."
"The European Parliament's call for the control, monitoring and evaluation of the EU's actions now appears all the more urgent since a substantial amount of funding has been accumulated over the years with the extension of EU activities into the area of human rights."
"These actions are becoming more and more varied and the number of actors is also increasing."
"Parliament's own ""European democracy initiative' currently holds funding of ECU 96 million."
"The fragmentation of budgetary resources for human rights and democracy projects into numerous budget categories and the lack of a coherent strategy and the division of responsibilities for its implementation within the Commission, have all contributed to this lack of transparency."
"In 1994 the Commission had more than 30 budget lines for development cooperation and humanitarian aid alone."
"Then there are the funds from budget heading B-8 for monies agreed under the CFSP."
"My report on the creation of a uniform coordination structure is directed at a greater streamlining of responsibilities as well as the implementation of projects."
"In accordance with the Committee on Budgets this report therefore opposes external structures."
"I do not wish to see any external structure and if my practical proposal recommends an office for human rights and democracy within the Commission, Mr Imbeni, then that is not an office whose activities should be divided, but rather one which the Commission should set up and administer in the same way as the ECHO, so that these matters are not coordinated by an anonymous department but by an outwardly transparent operations centre - and this office may do just that."
"A second proposal which I wish to make concerns the setting up of a dedicated data network for this sector. Such a network would help the institutions of the European Union, as well as outside agencies, to concentrate the available body of information and to put this into practical effect in a more efficient way."
"I also want to see the institutions dovetailed into a working group for democracy and human rights, as also agreed in the budget, which is something you also address; such a group, whose role would be an advisory one, could be constituted from representatives of Parliament and of the Commission as part of the annual programme."
"The effective coordination of institutions and international organizations, whose role is to monitor and assist the process of free elections, is essential for the establishment of an effective, financially viable and transparent system."
"The consolidation of the 1998 budget will also help do the groundwork here."
"If we are to achieve as broad a synergy and multiplier effect as possible, the EU must coordinate its human rights policy measures more effectively, and this includes international organizations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and others, by concluding the sort of cooperation agreements which we really want to see."
"The aid which we provide in this area often goes unnoticed."
"I can only agree with the report which has been presented by Mr Imbeni."
"We really are on the same wavelength in this respect."
"We both call for better information on the EP and on the efficiency, or failure, of the various programmes and projects, as measured against their impact on human rights and democracy in third countries. We also call for a transparent strategy for the use of funds and improved procedures for the implementation of projects - and this is also the underlying message of my report on the simplification of structures."
"I too followed the conference on the Phare and Tacis programmes, which involved the NGOs, and I was also able to obtain useful information for my report."
"A further basic requirement is the need for better coordination within the Commission and between the various institutions, as well as the removal of the geographical divisions."
"On this point we all totally agreed."
"A superposed coordination structure, under the jurisdiction of a Commissioner for human rights and democracy, would be required not only to administer the programmes and projects but also to coordinate the guarantee and sanction policies."
"After Amsterdam the Commission promised to introduce a uniform Commission structure for human rights and democracy for the next period and I hope very much that this will become a reality."
"I would like to ask the Commission quite openly what it intends doing to bring this about."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me close by stating that one of the most difficult and yet rewarding tasks of the European Union must surely be for its institutions to carry to the world the message of peace and freedom which is based on the respect of human rights and the ability to live together in accordance with democratic principles."
"We hope that after the Amsterdam Treaty this part of the EU's foreign policy will play an even greater role and will help carry our message even further afield."
"Madam President, shortly after I was first elected to Parliament in 1989, I was asked to take part in a parliamentary delegation to observe the first ever democratic elections in Chile following the Pinochet dictatorship."
"While I was there I was struck by the number of people who came up to me quite spontaneously to thank me and others in our delegation for the work the European Union had done in preserving and developing democracy in Chile during the years of the dictatorship."
"That made a very deep impression on me because it made me realize just how important the European Union's work on human rights is, and the effect of often quite small amounts of money, especially the effect they can have on developing democracy in countries which are suffering from a lack of human rights."
"That is why I am very strongly supportive of the policies the European Union pursues."
"However, it has to be said that the human rights policy of the European Union has grown up on a very ad hoc basis."
"In many ways Mrs Lenz has indicated that in her earlier remarks."
"It is still very ad hoc as we can see from Parliament's work."
"Our monthly saga of Thursday afternoon urgencies shows a certain lack of coordination and coherence when we are looking at human rights situations"
"Similarly, as we have heard, the Commission's organization of its work on human rights also shows a lack of coherence and coordination."
"In the Council the CFSP has had its weaknesses as we have outlined before and there is not sufficient evidence of a coherence of approach."
"Now, with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Commission report which we are debating today, we should move towards a situation where human rights is much more closely integrated within the common foreign and security policy."
"In particular, I am looking to the Council and the Commission, working on the development of the policy planning unit that is an essential part of the Amsterdam Treaty, to ensure there is an effective human rights dimension and conflict prevention dimension in the work of that unit."
"We need to try to define what we mean by an ethically orientated foreign policy for the European Union and we need to try to find a better balance between the institutions."
"In the light of the Amsterdam Treaty and the work in Parliament by Mr Avgerinos, for example, on improving the way we deal with urgencies, we have to try to make a fresh start on human rights and to have a trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament where we can sit down and start to define where we are going on human rights and how we can improve the administration of human rights."
"In particular, we should look at how we assess value for money from our projects."
"The Commission is very good at developing new ideas but less good at managing these ideas once they are up and running."
"We ought to look at how we release funds."
"Far too often funds are held up and NGOs run into difficulties because of the delays in getting funds released."
"In conclusion, we ought to look also at what we do with countries like, for example, Hong Kong - which I only mention because it is fresh in my mind - where the administration argues that money we give for support of human rights is actually political interference and refuses to allow us to spend that money."
"Finally, I welcome both these reports but I urge that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, in this debate on human rights one almost invariably immediately starts talking about concrete problems;"
"Algeria, Burma, Nigeria or about the plight of refugees, child slaves, or abused women, and one immediately asks for action."
"But this debate is about something else."
"Mr Imbeni and Mrs Lenz in their report primarily talked about the structures within the European Commission for human rights policy."
"This is a good thing, because if you want expose something, and wish to see action, the appropriate instruments are needed."
"They have to be effective, that is what counts."
"Against this background both reports are extremely useful."
"Mr Imbeni's report, which is a response to the European Commission document, uncovers in great detail a number of weak points in the Commission's organization of its work on human rights."
"In its document the Commission has tried to circumnavigate these problems by giving a kind of catalogue of the actual human rights and democratisation projects from a regional perspective."
"We can safely say that most of these projects are fine, and that it is likely that the Commission will implement them properly, but the Commission's document contains no evaluation."
"This is no surprise, because Mr Imbeni concludes quite rightly that the Commission's organization of the human rights policy is rather chaotic."
"Too many budget items, too many directorates-general who step in, too much red tape, and too little coordination, evaluation and effectiveness."
"When we examine these different approaches, they can also be found in Mrs Lenz' report."
"It is a miracle in fact that so many good things still happen when you read those two reports."
"That does not alter the fact that I agree with both colleagues."
"If one examines all activities, one has to conclude that more coordination and better streamlining of actions is urgently needed."
"That is why Mrs Lenz's idea of arriving at one coordinating body within the Commission, primarily aimed at programmes and actions in the sphere of human rights, minority rights and democratisation, is a good idea."
"I think it should be something like ECHO for humanitarian aid, but as part of the Commission."
"Mr President, it is a good idea, as it may not only save much money and energy, but one might also be able to do a great deal more, and much more effectively, with this same money."
"In addition I think it is excellent if a European network for human rights is made available to allow the necessary information flow smoothly."
"Finally I would like to support for the idea for a unit at European level for monitoring elections."
"Our socialist colleague spoke just now about the way the elections in Chile were observed - I was there in 1989 - and this happened in an excellent way."
"Still we frequently see that American or other delegations handle their work efficiently and better than ours."
"Yet it is important, because the preventative effects of these kind of monitoring committees is excellent."
"Mr President, I conclude by saying that both rapporteurs have delivered excellent work."
"They have submitted good proposals to the Commission and we would like to ask of the European Commission to take these reports to heart, and to take up the proposals."
"The European Union itself is a stronghold of human rights and democracy; let us emanate this in an efficient manner throughout the world."
"Madam President, though we may question whether the human rights policy pursued by the European Union is consistent, outside Europe it is experienced a great deal more positively, considering the many times appeal is made to our human rights policy."
"You also heard Mr Titley and Mrs Maij-Weggen say this just now."
"Yet on the eve of the Euro-Asian summit we have to accept the fact that entire continents distance themselves from our policy."
"That is why it is good that by coincidence the Commissioner who is to some extent an expert in the field is here tonight."
"I would like him to tell me a bit more about how he sees the proposals on the table being implemented."
"Anyhow, because some countries distance themselves from our continuous persistence on human rights, the better gearing of the human rights policy within the institutions is all the more necessary, as well as making them more transparent, quicker to implement and more effective."
"On the eve of the celebration of the 50th Declaration of Human Rights, Mr Imbeni and Mrs Lenz have submitted two excellent, clear and to my mind implementable reports."
"The proposal to establish a coordination unit very much appeals to me."
"I believe, as Mrs Lenz remarked, that it requires a Commissioner who is entirely responsible for this policy."
"For the sake of the general public I think it is an excellent idea to publicize what were are doing in the institutions in future via the electronic highway or the Internet."
"This is a good thing."
"Our showpiece during the recent past was observations at elections."
"The Union managed to appear consistent to the outside world, as visible responsibility."
"It is therefore very right that Mrs Lenz requests a material foundation for this in the specific budget."
"It seems a good idea to me to hold an annual evaluation conference, as suggested by Mr Imbeni."
"It gives the Commission, as well as this Parliament, more power in its functioning."
"It will probably direct more individuals and NGOs in our direction, which will have to make us even more selective, and we will have to give more meaning to our programmes, but with these proposals as they are before us, this must be possible in the sense of coordinating them."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the Lenz and Imbeni reports are an excellent culmination of this year."
"I congratulate both colleagues, and look forward to the time when, with these reports as a solid support at the end of our mandate, we will be able to promote human rights within the European Union as well as outside."
"Madam President, Mrs Lenz and Mr Imbeni speak with one voice; that saves me one response."
"She calls for more coordination, consistency, coherence and this deserves full support, from the Liberal Group."
"The Commission, too, occasionally deserves praise for its dedication to increased effectiveness and transparency."
"But at the same time both rapporteurs' proposals for better ideas to improve consistency have not just sprung up overnight."
"Our group supports the proposal for the setting up of one single service for human rights and democratization within the Commission."
"But this should not mean we should get a common administrative structure for all agencies offering foreign aid."
"Aid should continue to be part of the main thrust of the policy."
"Aid is the means of the policy, not an end in itself."
"Annual evaluation conferences on human rights and democratisation programmes for third countries are much more effective."
"I gladly support the strengthened role of Union delegations in third countries, the inclusion of human rights in the job responsibilities of the planning unit of the CFSP and in the creation of an interinstitutional working group to set up a European network for human rights and democratization."
"Then we come to the observers, and as Mrs Lenz knows, the monitoring of elections; I, for example, have been able to experience this as a recipient from this Parliament in various third world countries some time ago, and also as a participant in observation delegations, and I have been embarrassed, Madam President, Mr Commissioner."
"I hope it will become true that in this Parliament we will have an ""A-team' from which we will be able to recruit those who will be able to observe in a truly professional way."
"I have said it before in the foreign affairs committee, as Mrs Lenz and Mr Imbeni both know."
"I think these two reports provide useful starting points."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the possession of human rights allows each individual man and woman to retain his or her dignity."
"Human rights are indivisible and universal."
"I stress this yet again because it is a fact which is sometimes overlooked in the daily routine of EU politics."
"The protection of human rights and minorities and the furtherance of democracy must be priority issues for a combined foreign and defence policy."
"We strongly reject any attempt to reverse these priorities in order to promote the cause of economic relations."
"Parliament will be keeping the pressure on and, what is more, has even established a budget line for the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights to the effect that a financial basis has now been laid for real action."
"However, the EU is still a long way from having a coherent civil foreign policy."
"As long as departmentalized thinking continues, as long as foreign policy is divided geographically within the Commission and as long as development policy is subjected to constant budget cuts, we shall never succeed in evolving a consistent and integrated human rights policy."
"Such a sound concept is of course the basis for a credible foreign policy."
"The Commission itself is not in a position to carry through the human rights programme because there simply is no comprehensive strategy for all EU policies."
"In this respect Mr Lenz's report on proposals for improving our administrative structure is particularly valuable."
"We support the proposal for setting up an office of human rights and democracy within the Commission."
"This would also facilitate collaboration with non-governmental organizations, which are an important part of a durable policy on human rights and democratization."
"I refer in particular to decentralized projects based on local initiatives which make a vital contribution to social stability and to human rights activities which seek to protect and restore the dignity of individual men and women."
"Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I, like the rest of my group, am in complete agreement with the need to increase coordination, unify services, and rationalize a number of things."
"But a political responsibility is essential, and we frequently have difficulty in finding out where it lies within the Commission."
"May I congratulate Mrs Lenz, and Mr Imbeni who have written reports to that effect?"
"However, Point 7 of Mr Imbeni's report, in which he proposes to report on the public bodies of third countries, which hinder human rights projects, seems rather disputable to me."
"I think we could have an annex and add 'to the bodies of the European Union' , because as some Members know, although a number of projects remain blocked in the Commission for many months, waiting to obtain the funding, which has been agreed, there are other projects."
"I am very pleased that Commissioner Brittan is present, because some very important projects regarding democratization and human rights have been sitting in drawers in the Commission's departments for two years."
"A radio project 'Boys of Tibet' has been waiting for the Commission's go-ahead for two years."
"I would be very pleased if the Commissioner could answer this point."
"I should also like him to reply to the requests made, on many occasions, by this Parliament, regarding a number of persons who are imprisoned."
"They are Mr Wang Dan, Mr Hada, Mr Nawang Choepel, and the young Panchen Lama (Gedhun Choekyi Nyima) of whom we have no news, although we have many times asked the Commission to intervene with regard to the liberation of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in China, and other Asian countries."
"I would be very pleased, Mr Commissioner if, like the United States, which has obtained the liberation of Mr Wei Jinsheng, the Commission were also soon to announce the liberation of the above four people, and of any other people to whom I have not referred today."
"Madam President, the political systems are all the more democratic and pluralist as their political institutions become more effective and their legal systems more independent."
"The calling to the protection of human rights, even outside the Union, is sanctioned by the preambles to the treaties, and therefore constitutes a priority which we do not always manage to satisfy even if we, as the European Union, are one of the largest sources for the financing and promotion of initiatives aimed at the protection of these rights."
"A European Union which, however, is not managing to provide the necessary transparency to make its overall effort for the promotion of human rights as visible as possible."
"In our opinion, given its natural democratic specificity, the European Parliament should be more effective in defining policies on human rights, firstly by placing the financing allocated to the sector in one single budget entry and, even if this happened recently, exercising the additional budget power provided by the Treaty, which has still not seemed sufficient."
"Above all, our Parliament should be able to operate in the context of a necessary unity in the disbursement sector; the Directorates General of the Commission seem to be called upon too much to draw up lists of priorities of activities and to exercise priorities of spending."
"Although this could contribute towards a greater knowledge of sectoral and specific problems, it would certainly not improve the possibility and efficacy of Union intervention."
"The geographic compartmentalization within the Commission is made worse by the various budget entries, that waste funds allocated to spending."
"In addition to the managerial problems of aid for the sector, the practice of policies actually aimed at the protection of human rights seems lame to us."
"Several examples include the Council resolution which, with regard to asylum procedure, provides for the application of the concept of the safe third country, actually requires the transit country bordering the Member States to readmit persons seeking asylum without providing sufficient legal guarantees, particularly for the victims of acts of violence, women and children, and belittles the quality of the protection of human rights, which we are deciding upon."
"Another example of family protection is the protection of human rights in the sector, which is also a priority of our family policies, which is thwarted when we do not recognize that the immigrant citizens of third countries have the right to live in families, the right to reunite the family."
"The extension of Europol's competence, particularly the drugs unit, that could effectively combat the plague of the trafficking in human beings and the paedophilia and child prostitution networks, although established in September, during the course of a Union Council, has not yet begun, while the same Europol Convention has not yet been ratified by all the Member States."
"The European citizen asks us for assurance and we therefore consider it essential, in defining the policies on the right to the protection of human rights, to take measures to coordinate the criminal legislation of the Member States so as to establish a clause of universal extraterritoriality, which makes it possible to make inquiries, prosecute and penalize individuals committing offences abroad and then avoiding the punishment by hiding in the folds of an incomplete legal system which, in our opinion, should be defined as a matter of urgency on pain of our credibility in the protection of human rights."
"Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs for these reports on measures intended to promote observance of human rights."
"The overall objective of any development policy must be to strive to build and strengthen democracy and the rule of law, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In all agreements with third countries the European Union must continue to press for the inclusion of specific human rights clauses."
"The fact that the European Union is the world's principal donor of humanitarian aid, is neither known nor understood by many of our citizens."
"I believe we should draw clear guidelines for the acknowledgement and publication of the very important financial contribution the European Union makes to human rights and development of the third world."
"While I do not agree with the policy of the US - a policy of no aid without trade - it is essential that we remain rigorous and firm with our policy of no aid without linkage to democracy, human rights and freedom."
"In relation to statistics - and many other speakers have already made reference to this - we need a clear breakdown of the funding from all sources, whether they are governmental, semi-state, NGOs or whatever, and we need clear evaluation of the effectiveness of human rights projects funded by the Commission."
"Unfortunately, the report does not compare projects for effectiveness, nor does it set down the criteria on which projects are or should be assessed."
"In the context of the forthcoming negotiations on future relations between the European Union and the ACP countries under the Lomé Convention, a stable political system, full respect for human rights, effective participation by society, allied to good government and sound administration, should be recognized as fundamental foundations for sustainable development and the focus of our development policy."
"Madam President, firstly I think one of our most important tasks in Parliament is to keep watch on human rights and democracy."
"People expect that of us, and in this area we also have strong public support."
"This is, of course, particularly important for countries with which we have agreements, countries with which we have some connection."
"Perhaps this is most important for applicant countries like Slovakia and Turkey, where shortcomings need to be corrected."
"I would, however, stress that it is important that the aim of our measures and efforts should be to help to solve problems and not simply to point out countries which do not fulfil the requirements."
"The control, support, effectiveness and reporting of our measures need to be improved."
"I would particularly like to emphasize some of the ELDR Group's amendments in the report."
"These relate to paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 in the Imbeni report."
"A collective agreement on human rights is good."
"In addition the Commission should collect information from international organizations such as Amnesty, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mr Imbeni and Mrs Lenz on their reports and to state that naturally we must focus our efforts on increasing the effectiveness of the Commission itself in all its policies, rather than shifting responsibility away from the Commission by way of various offices and other structures."
"I believe that this has become quite clear."
"I also wish to refer to a particular matter which has been discussed in detail in the Committee on Budgets, namely a change in the structure of interinstitutional cooperation."
"I believe that this is very important."
"We are dissolving the old advisory group, which used to draw up recommendations for individual projects in conjunction with the Commission and the various institutions, and intend setting up an interinstitutional consultative working group whose role will be to assess the annual Work Programme."
"This proposal is set out in our amendment."
"This seems to be a more rational way for Parliament and Commission to deal with one another."
"And I hope that by discussing a Work Programme at the beginning of the year we will really introduce greater transparency and control into this area."
"Madam President, today we are discussing a document from the European Commission on the implementation in 1995 of its actions to promote human rights and democratisation."
"The rapporteur, Mr Imbeni, has already laid his finger on the problem in his introduction, and I quote: ' the communication ... has the character of a catalogue of good works ... (but) does not present itself as an assessment of the effectiveness of human rightsrelated activities' ."
"It is curious that very large sums, fortunes in fact, have been invested in all kinds of projects, but that apparently there were no interim criteria to verify the usefulness of these investments, or in any case afterwards, and that no investigations were made either into whether the subsidized projects and organizations were also supported by third parties, for example the Member States, independently."
"As far as that is concerned I can only agree wholeheartedly with paragraphs 16 and 17 of the report."
"I have to admit, however, that my criticism is more fundamental, and that we will have to ask ourselves whether it should be the responsibility of European common institutions in the first place to play a kind of UN, a kind of reduced United Nations, with a truly opaque subsidizing policy, and especially, and this my basic remark, without being this encapsulated in a coherent foreign policy."
"Please do not misunderstand me."
"I am not saying that all the money in this budget area has been spent fruitlessly."
"But I do question in a major way the lack of monitoring when subsidies are given, the lack of evaluation afterwards, the fundamental desirability of leaving the implementation of this policy, which should form part of a coherent foreign policy when it is deemed necessary, in the hands of the European Commission."
"Besides, I am not able to check the expenditure of these funds on my own."
"But I do know the way in which Commission officials in my own country use all kinds of subsidies to all kinds of organizations."
"I can only ascertain that organizations are subsidised which either only represent themselves, or are not worthy of receiving anything, or already get their fair share from various other subsidy sources."
"I am thinking of a number of trade unions, for instance."
"It might be the case, and I hope so, that the Commission manages the budgets we are talking about today more usefully."
"But if this is the case, then I cannot deduce this from the document the Commission is submitting."
"I in any case will continue to go on about the fact that in our own Member States millions of people live in abject poverty, so that it is not acceptable in my view to spend large amounts if and when the usefulness of this expenditure of these sums is not even investigated and above all evaluated."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the defence of human rights has been one of the great causes, one of the strongest causes in the political aims of the European Union."
"It would be good for human beings all over the world if those aims could be increasingly present and effective in the European Union's decisions and initiatives."
"Unfortunately the Union's actions are not particularly visible - I mean in so far as European citizens are not familiar with them, because I know they support us in those decisions and therefore ought to be familiar with them - and the political reflections of those actions are normally confined to our parliamentary discussions."
"There are not sufficient institutional structures in the European Union for the adequate processing of information on infringements of human rights."
"There is a lack of coordination of actions to defend human rights, and the available financial resources are patently insufficient and lacking in coordination to promote actions to defend the dignity of being human."
"It is also regrettably clear in many cases that economic interests, which have a certain control over information, override and almost nullify the political and humanitarian positions in defence of human rights which we have come here to uphold."
"All these comments are mentioned and well analysed in the reports by Mr Imbeni and Mrs Lenz, whom I would like to compliment on their work. We support their reports and we would ask this House to approve them."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, human rights are valued very highly in Austria."
"Looking ahead to Austria's Council presidency in the second half of next year we are conscious of the fact that in 1998 we are celebrating Human Rights Year, and this is an issue which will assume increasing significance."
"Next autumn, an experts conference on this theme is to be held in Vienna and on the eve of the summit meeting of Heads of State and of Government in Vienna the Foreign Ministers will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights."
"This will also see the adoption of action plan ""Human Rights 2000' ."
"Such actions serve to illustrate the high priority which Austria attaches to the subject of human rights."
"I welcome the proposals being put forward by the rapporteur and by Mr Imbeni, since I too believe that it is sensible to have a uniform structure to deal with human rights and democratisation."
"Better coordination within the Commission, a strengthening of the Council's authority over human rights issues and greater cooperation with the European Parliament, all these would be very welcome moves indeed."
"The aim of the 1998 Year of Human Rights must be to underpin the respect of universal standards of human rights at national level by effective control, support and deterrence."
"Over the last 50 years the international system has laid the legal and practical foundation for the protection of human rights."
"Now it is time for these principles to be implemented at national and local level."
"All too often, unfortunately, economic interests take precedence over human rights issues."
"We in the European Parliament must, therefore, never relax in our determination to draw attention to human rights violations."
"But to put something into practice also means ratifying it, and in international law this is regrettably not always possible."
"Consequently, in this Year of Human Rights 1998, we must assert our democratically legitimate role as a guardian of these principles."
"Madam President, I wish firstly to thank Mrs Lenz and Mr Imbeni most heartily for the excellent work which they have undertaken."
"In this respect I would like to make a number of comments which are indirectly connected with their report and which have probably been engendered by it."
"The first of these concerns the fact that we have far too many organizations working against each other and generally getting in each other's way."
"We have to establish some kind of order here."
"I am looking at his mainly from the perspective of those peoples who are in direct contact with the actions concerned, since I frequently travel to central and eastern Europe, where I am witness to the major problems which arise, and this is something which we must bear in mind."
"My second point is one which has already been touched on, namely that we must exercise stricter control on the assistance we provide, for this is an important matter."
"We already have a very good Committee on Budgetary Control, and its work is exemplary, but this body is hardly in a position to take on additional responsibilities."
"However, there is no doubt that some similar type of organization would be required here."
"As far as the annual reports are concerned, I consider these to be absolutely essential, particularly when they are entrusted to people who really know something about the subject."
"In conclusion let me add one more thing: The respect of human rights is a very laudable principle."
"However, all too often this can be used by certain regimes to conceal the fact that they do not adequately recognize collective rights."
"I see this especially in the treatment of minority groups - linguistic minorities, racial minorities and ethnic minorities."
"I believe we should draw attention to the fact that a European bill of rights for ethnic groups and minorities is absolutely imperative."
"This must be made prosecutable in law so that we can ultimately bring real order to this area of human affairs."
"Madam President, in the course of the debate not surprisingly a number of broader considerations have been raised and I hope the House will forgive me if I am not able to follow even the fruitful avenues that have been pursued."
"I would like to comment on some of the specific points but I should first of all like to say how much Mr van den Broek would have liked to have been present, in particular, because of his high regard for the reports of Mrs Lenz and Mr Imbeni."
"I shall firstly deal with the very specific point made by Mr Imbeni about the Amsterdam Summit conclusions. These refer to an initiative for a post-graduate course for a European master's degree in human rights and democracy."
"It is envisaged that ten universities from ten countries will participate and it will be handled, as I understand it, by the University of Venice, although further details obviously still have to be worked out."
"I shall now comment on some more general points."
"Firstly, Mrs Lenz and others talked about the possibility of there being one Commissioner in charge."
"I am not sure that would solve the problem."
"The real problem is not so much that there are different Commissioners but that there are different considerations relating to geographical situation and a human rights consideration generally."
"It is impossible to deal with that by isolating human rights and putting it in one Commissioner's hands."
"For example, to take an area for which I am responsible as I am answering this debate, namely China, there is a very important human rights dimension and at the same time a broader China policy."
"You cannot simply solve that by saying that the human rights aspect should be dealt with by a Commissioner responsible for human rights."
"That would weaken the policy for human rights itself."
"It is only handling China as such that one can have the proper balance in handling things between a broader policy and a human rights policy."
"As far as I am concerned, the human rights policy is an integral part of China policy and not just an add-on that you could give to someone else."
"So that is not necessarily the most attractive solution although one can continue to reflect on it."
"Incidentally, Mr de Vries referred to individual cases."
"I am not in a position to give a list of answers on individual cases."
"I am not sure that is the purpose of this debate but he happened to mention the Panchen Lama and I can only say that I raised that matter myself at the highest level."
"I cannot pretend that I received a satisfactory answer."
"The mystery, I fear, remains."
"Reference has also been made to the delay between a project being suggested and it being taken up or implemented."
"The reasons are various."
"Sometimes it is because the idea is of such a general character that it needs to be worked up and that takes time."
"Sometimes it is because it raises controversial questions and you need to hear different people's views on whether it is a good idea or not."
"And sometimes it is because of the question of access to money for the particular project."
"Incidentally, I am not saying that in the Commission any more than in any other organization there are never failings of an administrative character."
"Of course there are sometimes."
"But it is useful to mention some of the broader factors that may lead to delays, annoying though they always are."
"Finally, on these general points, I should say a word about visibility."
"A number of people have spoken about the importance of visibility and I entirely agree."
"There is not much point in doing something in this area if people do not know what is going on."
"If you are advising people and helping people to build a bridge, it is useful and good for the image of the European Union that people should know that the European Union is giving help."
"But, in the case of human rights activities, I would suggest that the visibility is a much more central feature of what we are doing."
"It shows not only that we are doing something but also that our concern about the country is one in which human rights is central."
"I will now deal with some of the more specific points, thanking both Mrs Lenz and Mr Imbeni for their admirable reports."
"The Commission shares their views in considering that priority should be given to ensuring coherence of the initiatives taken and the best use of the financial resources provided."
"That is why, since his appointment Mr Santer has personally taken charge of this very sensitive and delicate facet of external policy and Mr van den Broek has been assigned responsibility for the thematic and horizontal aspects of the subject."
"Within the departments, the role of coordination has been assigned to the Human Rights and Democratization Unit of Directorate-General IA, and that unit also provides a secretariat to the Steering Committee which is a coordinating body at the level of Deputy Director General set up in 1997."
"In addition, the unit provides the chairmanship of the interdepartmental human rights group set up in 1991."
"Implementation of human rights and democratization policy at the geographical level, to which I have referred, is the responsibility of the Commissioners in charge of political, economic and trade ties with the various non-member countries."
"The Commission has restructured the departments of its Directorates General, managing the human rights budget headings by creating in each of them a unit in charge of ensuring that all activities carried out in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law dovetail with cooperation activities."
"It is by maintaining this unity of competence and management of resources at the geographical level that human rights and democratization issues, which are part and parcel of cooperation with third countries, can be effectively pursued. While recognizing that this coordination could be improved, we have made a real effort and will continue to do so."
"With regard to some of the more specific requests in the draft resolutions relating to the measures aimed at defining a joint strategy for using financial resources allocated to human rights, the interdepartmental group for human rights and democracy identifies each year the thematic priorities and target groups corresponding to the budget headings of chapter B7-70."
"For the future the Commissioners propose, in a proposal for a regulation aimed at providing a legal basis for the human rights headings, the implementation of programmes designed to give a coherent framework of action in a given country or region or on a particular topic."
"With regard to the request to be notified regularly by the Commission of action taken in non-member countries, I would like to point out that various reports take stock of such action, such as the reports on action taken on the resolution on human rights, democracy and development, and the annual reports on the implementation of action to promote human rights and democratization which review the use of all funds under Chapter B7-70."
"Moreover, the Commission also draws up an annual report on the utilization of the headings: ' democratization process in Latin America' and 'Meda for democracy' ."
"The Commission will take account of Parliament's requests in drawing up the annual reports, starting with 1996-97 report, which is currently under way."
"The need to improve coordination with international and regional organizations is a continuous concern of ours."
"I should like to stress that we and the Council of Europe have long been engaged in substantial cooperation by financing joint programmes in central and eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union."
"As regards the United Nations, it is examining at the moment the possibility of strengthening cooperation with the office of High Commissioner on Human Rights."
"The monitoring of elections has been referred to."
"That has for some years given rise to an increasing number of requests."
"The Commission takes the view that priority should be given to a professional approach - which a number of people have favoured in the debate - in terms of methodology, logistics and training."
"Thanks to the funds that have been made available, pilot schemes have been carried out over the last couple of years."
"We will also examine the proposal to create a European network for human rights and democracy in the light of experience gained and also taking due account of other networks such as the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and that of the Council of Europe."
"We have noted Mr Imbeni's proposal for the annual organization of an evaluation conference based on the model of the Phare and Tacis programmes conference."
"To respond to your concern about interinstitutional cooperation, I should like to point out that as early as 1989, the Commission approved the proposal aimed at facilitating interinstitutional contacts by creating a working group with the task of setting up an information exchange network and mapping out a joint action on human rights."
"At the same time we have taken note of the proposal to amend the 1998 budget to create a consultative committee on human rights action programmes."
"Let me stress that coherence, effectiveness and flexibility are the criteria which drive our positions in the various fields involving human rights."
"Thank you, Commissioner Brittan."
"Does either of the two rapporteurs wish to take the floor?"
"No."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Benchmarking"
"The next item is the report (A4-0387/97) by Mr Murphy, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Benchmarking - implementation of an instrument available to economic actors and public authorities (COM(97)0153 - C4-0387/97)."
"Mr President, as I am going to represent the thoughts of our British colleague I thought I might do it in his own language."
"As you know, the British are justly famous for their punctuality and the Greeks are sadly notorious for their inconsistency, so I cannot help but take malicious pleasure from this temporary reversal of roles."
"I am glad to say to the Commissioner that the rapporteur welcomes the Commission's intention to establish a European network of expertise for enterprises to ensure the availability of coherent, trustworthy and equivalent services, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the European Union."
"The rapporteur also welcomes the Commission's announcement of a High Level Group on benchmarking, composed of industrialists, representatives of Chambers of Commerce and employers' associations, trade unions, consumers and the civil society."
"He stresses the importance for the High Level Group to utilize the highest quality statistical information available, and draws attention to the potential of Eurostat in this respect, to the potential of which I also gladly add my own testimonial."
"The rapporteur believes that the full value added of benchmarking to the European Union will be best realized if the particular needs of small and medium-sized enterprises are taken into account as a priority and calls in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises to be directly involved in the High Level Group through participants specifically representing SMEs, and also with the establishment of the European Network of benchmarking expertise."
"He calls for the European Parliament to be directly involved with the work of the High Level Group through observer status of a small number of MEPs, and reasserts the call for the European Parliament to be invited to participate in the annual tripartite Commission organized benchmark assessment visits to Japan and the United States of America."
"I believe this is a demand of particular relevance."
"Finally, he calls for a specific amendment to the 'Development of Human Resources' benchmarking pilot project to give much higher priority to the quality of managerial skills and training in the European Union, given that cost differentials between European firms and their Japanese and American counterparts are frequently due to operational inefficiencies and not labour market inefficiencies."
"I believe that this means that bosses should be benchmarked as well as workers, in an attempt to imitate the Japanese application to work rather than escape early on Friday in order to return back late on Monday and in the meantime shoot grouse or other beasts in the forests of England's green and pleasant land."
"High priority should be given to the interface between education and training on the one hand and the workplace on the other, as this is an area where the EU is clearly lagging behind other leading world economies."
"This should be done firmly within the context of lifelong learning."
"Human resources benchmarking is especially important."
"The comparative weakness of EU managerial skills and culture needs to be seriously investigated and addressed."
"Finally, the rapporteur congratulates the Commission once again and commends the report to the House."
"Let me balance what I said at the beginning by stressing that there was a great need for Mr Murphy to be absent today as he had to be in Britain on political business."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, four year after the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, I notice with satisfaction that benchmarking occupies an important place on the European employment agenda."
"When as far back as 1995 everyone was talking about European employment strategies and the European employment union, the liberals pointed out that the fight against unemployment is primarily a concern of national and regional authorities, and not Europe."
"We have always been great advocates of the principle of exchange of best competitive practice."
"Authorities want to know which labour market policy offers the best guarantees for more jobs, and entrepreneurs for their part want to learn how foreign competitors manage to increase their market share."
"Except that both public authorities and businesses lack comparable, reliable and coherent information."
"We therefore support the idea of a European knowledge based network for business, and of a High Level Group on Benchmarking."
"The rapporteur rightly argues for the direct involvement of SMEs in this context."
"I would like to hear from the Commission whether the SMEs will have active representation, and not merely be included."
"After all we should not forget that SMEs are still the biggest job creators."
"Without active cooperation from SMEs the whole affair will be rather pointless, it seems to me."
"We also look forward to the results of the pilot projects which the Commission has started."
"Is the Commission able to give any news on this yet?"
"Finally, I would to like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"He has highlighted the right things and stated that benchmarking should be integrated into the competition policy of Member States."
"We support his request for this Parliament to be directly involved in the High Level Working Group."
"I would like to know from the Commission if it is able to inform us yet if this request can be met."
"Mr President, benchmarking is fashionable."
"Many people are talking about benchmarking in all sorts of contexts."
"The Commission has already carried out a number of pilot projects and found that benchmarking is an enormously important method for investigating and finding out what shortcomings there are in the European business climate, and how we shall find solutions to these shortcomings."
"According to the Commission, and also to the report which we shall decide upon today, benchmarking should not only be applied at the company and industry level, but also in relation to framework conditions for companies."
"Benchmarking is not a new discovery, as people might easily think. It has been used for many years, both by European companies and especially in the USA since the method was developed in the 1970s."
"Benchmarking is certainly a very good method for measuring competitiveness, even in small and medium-sized companies."
"But at the same time I would advise against having too much faith in a single method which is still a very blunt instrument, particularly when comparing framework conditions, because tradition and culture are also reflected."
"That is indeed not something which is so easily measured or benchmarked."
"I am very satisfied with what the rapporteur writes in paragraph 10 that people should not identify competitiveness and the connection between the Union's losses in industrial markets with wage conditions."
"I also think it is good that he points out that, in fact, directors and company managements also need to be benchmarked."
"Finally, Mr President, I am a bit sceptical about taking up methods development at a political level."
"I think it would be more suitable for that to be done by a university or institute which is involved in methods development."
"Mr President, there can be no two ways about the usefulness of benchmarking as an instrument for improving European competitiveness as a whole."
"What we should be careful of, however, is to start seeing benchmarking as the miracle cure which releases us from all economic problems, such as unemployment, declining productivity, and reduced growth."
"The danger threatening us is the infamous reversal of means and objectives."
"We should also consider that applying this method will show up both the strong and the weak sides of the European economy."
"When we rule out possible conclusions beforehand, we are on the wrong track."
"Paragraph 10 gives an example of this."
"The link between the loss in market share and labour costs which are too high cannot be proven, it is true, but a reasonable case can be made for it."
"Benchmarking is primarily intended to make a comparison between expediency and effectiveness, as a result of which yardsticks and standards can be developed for the input of resources and the results which have be achieved by this."
"The working of the economy as a whole, of institutions and government organizations, this way is observed from the outside, as it were."
"This can be extremely educational, and will give rise to proper improvements."
"Finally, a remark about paragraph 11, in which a better matching of acquired skills through training and skills wanted in the workplace is urged for."
"I agree with the general tenor of this, but at the same time I set store by the fact that it is not industry which determines the substance of educational programmes and learning targets."
"Teaching is a multi-faceted process with specific characteristics which must not be dominated by financial motives."
"The consequences of the mental impoverishment of future generations are child's play in the comparison with the present unemployment problem in Europe."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank the Parliament for its interest in the communication and congratulate Mr Murphy in his absence on his admirable report."
"The integration of the Community's internal market, the prospects of economic and monetary union and globalization together all mean that European industry has to improve its competitiveness all the time."
"As has been stressed on a number of occasions, progress has been made but there is still a lot to be done for Europe to be able to face the challenges before it."
"That is the context in which the Commission proposed the benchmarking of competitive performance as a tool for continually monitoring the progress made and encouraging the adoption of the best competitive practices found at world level."
"I would agree with what has been said in the debate: it is a tool but not a panacea."
"The aim was to provide the European Union with a powerful instrument to boost its competitiveness and Parliament has supported that."
"The communication that we are discussing today is in response to subsequent calls by Parliament and the Council for the development of pilot projects designed to give concrete expression to our contribution."
"The projects formulated are aimed at improving the competitive performance of businesses, industries and the environment in which people work."
"Benchmarking the performance of businesses is first and foremost a task for industry itself."
"Public authorities can, however, help in the promotion of such investment."
"In this context and in agreement with Parliament's proposal, the Commission plans to give priority to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in setting up a European network for the benchmarking of business performance."
"Benchmarking the performance of sectors depends on the specific conditions in each sector and we duly noted Parliament's request to examine why some sectors perform better than others in their global competitiveness."
"In terms of overall economic competitiveness, it is the Member States that are primarily responsible for implementing the pilot projects and the Commission welcomes Parliament's request to the Member States to do what they can to play a full part in them. We will transmit Parliament's call that greater priority should be given to the standard of training of business managers during the pilot project on the development of human resources."
"We would also like to draw Parliament's attention to our recent report on the benchmarking of competitive performance in Ireland and New Zealand."
"This report could be regarded as a first step towards benchmarking the good performance of some Member States of the European Union as Parliament suggested in its report."
"As indicated in its communication, the Commission will set up a high-level advisory group on benchmarking early in the New Year."
"It will ensure that the make-up of the group represents varied interests; we welcome Parliament's request to be associated with the group's work and would ask it to designate a Member to be an observer."
"The Commission and the Member States have now launched this initiative for benchmarking the competitive performance of European industry."
"At the end of the pilot phase the results will be made available to Parliament and all others concerned."
"We are convinced that the experience will show the value of the benchmarking of competitive performance as a tool for improving the competitiveness of European industry."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Expenditure on CFSP"
"The next item is the report (A4-0339/97) by Mrs Müller, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Opinion No 1/97 of the Court of Auditors of the European Communities on the conditions governing the implementation of expenditure under the common foreign and security policy (C4-0220/97)."
"Mr President, foreign policy is the political area in which it is most difficult to anticipate events, in which the unexpected happens without warning and in which quick-thinking and well-reasoned decisions are of fundamental importance."
"A glance at joint actions already taken by the European Union, particularly the administration of Mostar, followed by electoral monitoring, as in Palestine and Bosnia, mine-clearance, special missions such as that to Ruanda, and the Kedo actions, all portray an extreme lack of coherence in the way in which these activities are being implemented and administered."
"This lack of uniformity also signifies a lack of transparency, a lack of structures and a lack of effective control."
"This can be blamed on a constructional defect in the Maastricht Treaty, which, while determining that decisions in respect of a common foreign and security policy were to be made in accordance with the rules of intergovernmental cooperation, also ruled that such actions would be implemented from the Community budget - and therefore in line with conventional practice."
"From the outset this loophole in the treaty inevitably led to conflicts between Parliament and the Council, and indeed also between Parliament and the Commission."
"Sadly, our hope that this deficiency might be rectified in Amsterdam was not fulfilled."
"The interinstitutional agreement merely related to issues associated with the rapid provision of funds for joint foreign and security actions and rejected the Council's attempt to declare these budget monies as mandatory."
"However, the question of how actions financed from the Community budget are to be implemented and controlled continued to be ignored."
"The credit for openly naming the deficiencies in this area, and for furnishing Parliament and the Commission with a guide-rule for resolving outstanding issues, must go to the Court of Auditors."
"It is therefore only logical that my report should propose further developing the current interinstitutional agreement."
"What is the point of all this?"
"Firstly, the biannual change in the presidency of the Council undermines the continuous control and management which is so vital for joint actions."
"Clearer operational rules are therefore needed in future."
"Secondly, Commission control must be clearly assured."
"It must participate extensively in the preparatory planning - and by this I mean the Council decision making stage - and implementation of joint actions, so that efficiency is ensured in financial, legal and operational terms."
"The many weaknesses in the system, particularly in the Mostar action, the lack of clarity on the management of funds and the collaboration between Commission departments in Brussels and special envoys in the field, indicate that the Commission must carry out its functions to the full."
"This is after all the most important pre-requisite if the Parliament is not to be refused its right to give good discharge to the Commission, especially as the Council is not covered by the judgement after trial process with the Court of Auditors."
"Thirdly, the European Union is increasingly associated with various financial backers via joint actions in international structures, such as in the case of Kedo, for example."
"To be able to assess the success of such actions, it is important not only to carry out an audit of the quota of funds allocated by the European Union, but also of course to have access to all available data associated with the project, particularly in respect of the contributions made by the individual Member States."
"The effectiveness of the European Union's foreign policy must be drastically increased."
"The additional arrangements provided under the Amsterdam Treaty are, in my opinion, not enough."
"But in all events Council and Parliament should together strive to ensure that this situation is not aggravated further by administrative and technical obstacles."
"The development of an interinstitutional agreement along the lines I have proposed, which has also been basically endorsed by the Commission in its Committee discussions, can constitute the next small step forwards."
"I would be pleased if the Council would confront this matter in a positive way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Müller not only for her report, but also for the thorough and unremitting way in which she has attended to the concerns of the common foreign and security policy, especially in the former Yugoslavia."
"She is very committed to her work there, and unfortunately the true message about this commitment is not being properly reflected in the contribution being made here today."
"The report itself was worthy of discussion, but was not controversial."
"It was supported by all Groups in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I hope that the lack of debate is not seen as a lack of interest, for that would indeed be regrettable."
"The report again demonstrates something which we have also seen elsewhere."
"It obviously has to do mainly with aspects of budgetary control and auditing, but ultimately the problems which Mrs Müller mentions in her report conceal far-reaching and fundamental political questions and it would be good if Members of this House, including those outside the Committee on Budgetary Control, could just give this matter some attention."
"The common foreign and security policy is a major undertaking and many more people than we sometimes think are hoping to get something out of this common European policy."
"Many also believe that this common foreign and defence policy is much further developed than is actually the case."
"But grand projects of this kind are often followed by that morning-after feeling when it comes to their actual implementation."
"These problems will of course be dealt with primarily in a report from the Court of Auditors."
"Lack of clear jurisdiction - a problem already mentioned by the rapporteur -, clashes of interest and confusion over the main objectives as well as over tasks which actually lie within the remit of the common development policy - all these problems make it difficult, and not only from the point of view of budget control, to say ""yes' and to say ""yes' unreservedly."
"And underlying all this are also political implications and these too are problems which we will have to deal with."
"The criticism which has been voiced is, as has been said, not that of an accountant declaring that individual bookkeeping items are difficult to separate."
"We need greater transparency and clarity so that the figures can be examined more easily."
"It is therefore much more a political criticism, to the effect that if we no longer know who is responsible for what, if we no longer know who decides what, then the whole system will be extremely difficult to assess."
"It will then be well nigh impossible to support decisions, since a decision viewed externally can only be approved or rejected, and from our point of view defended when it is attacked, when one knows what lies behind it."
"To this extent the clash of interests, the simultaneousness, which Mrs Müller touches on in her report and which has also been criticized by the Court of Auditors, is more than a question of the clear separation of the finances, more than a matter of finding a different way to regulate the financing and the control of this financing."
"I would ask you to bear in mind that the Common Foreign and Security Policy is also our coat of arms, a coat of arms which the European Union displays to the world."
"If there is confusion, if there is a lack of transparency, then let us carry out an internal examination of our budgetary control procedure, but you must see that the confusion which we find in this area is a sign, a symptom of a more far-reaching disarray, and this may well be seen around the world, even by people who do not even know that there is a Committee for Budgetary Control or even a European Court of Auditors."
"If this confusion, this lack of transparency, should give rise to a loss of credibility, then this will not be directed at our financial control procedure but will impact upon the political standing of the European Union."
"In this respect I would ask Mrs Müller just to carry on exactly as she has been doing."
"And I would also like to ask the other Members of this House to continue to examine these issues outside of this debate."
"Before Mrs Müller leaves us, for I know that she is extremely pressed for time, I would just like to state openly how much I welcome her report and to congratulate her on her work."
"My Party supports the report and its theme, the financing of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, constitutes a real interface between the first and the second pillar of the EU Treaty."
"The rapporteur has therefore been dealing with an area in which the temptation to be drawn into dogmatism, a religious war as it were, is very great indeed."
"Mrs Müller has not succumbed to this temptation and has instead opted for a constructive approach."
"This does not mean that we should be satisfied with the outcome of Amsterdam as far as the Common Foreign and Security Policy is concerned."
"Mrs Müller's report makes this all too clear."
"We in this Parliament would have liked the European Council to have shown a lot more courage here, rather than the fainthearted approach adopted to date."
"But let us accept things just as they are."
"In future, the political will of the Governments for joint action will continue to hold sway over the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Nothing will happen without this political will from the Member States and where there is no political will, the Common Foreign and Security Policy will not even have the effect of a fig-leaf."
"Sadly, this has been our experience over the course of the last four years."
"On the other side of the coin, however, it can be said that where there is a will for collaboration, or at least where the chance exists for developing one, then the Community can make a useful contribution."
"And this does not only apply to the issue of financing."
"The Court of Auditors has summed up the figures for previous years and the result is clear-cut: more than 90 % of the funds allocated for joint actions came from the EU budget."
"We in the European Parliament have therefore to take full responsibility vis-à-vis the electors."
"We want to live up to that responsibility."
"We do not want to seize the reins of European foreign policy ourselves - that would not be the role of any Parliament, and certainly not a European one - but we also want to be able to monitor the situation and to satisfy ourselves that European taxpayers' money is being used wisely and well."
"In July we reached an agreement with the Commission and the Council that should facilitate cooperation on these issues."
"Here I can only reiterate what was clearly stated in Mrs Müller's report, namely that the consent embodied in this agreement is a clear sign of the goodwill and trust which we intend to demonstrate."
"It is to be hoped that the agreement will not only put an end to the long smouldering conflict between Council and Parliament, but will also lay the foundation for a constructive new beginning."
"We must therefore be allowed to develop this agreement further."
"As ever, our main attention is directed at the former Yugoslavia."
"To date, almost ECU 200 million have been spent in this region as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The lion's share of this has gone to Mostar."
"Our Committee has developed an excellent relationship with Hans Koschnick, the former administrator of Mostar."
"Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative in Sarajevo, has agreed to attend a meeting of our Committee in January, when we will mainly be discussing the issue of fraud in the distribution of aid subsidies."
"We continue to hear and read disturbing stories on this subject."
"Also underlying this, however, is the question of what changes should be brought to the remit and to the work of the Commission in the former Yugoslavia."
"To put it concisely, it would seem that for a long time some members of the Commission have failed to comprehend just how much has been, and is, expected of them in respect of the challenge there."
"To react to this with even more red-tape is the worst response imaginable."
"Here the Commission is on the point of gambling away the substantial amount of trust which has been built up."
"In this connection we eagerly await a special report from the Court of Auditors and in closing may I express my thanks to the latter for the position it has adopted, which is the subject of today's debate, and request that this report be passed on to us as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I have a feeling, when I analyse the Müller report, that the technical opinion of the Court of Auditors of the European Communities on the difficulties relating to the implementation of expenditure under the CFSP is in fact only an excuse for the Committee on Budgetary Control to reaffirm the philosophy of integral communitarization which is dominant at present."
"Mrs Müller is however right to point out the existence of a flaw in the CFSP."
"What is particularly serious, is that this flaw is now written into the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In a totally incoherent way, the Treaty first of all reaffirms the obviously intergovernmental nature of the CFSP, and then creates a Community competence with regard to the funding of the operating expenditure of the CFSP out of nothing, thus reversing the economy of the Treaty of Maastricht."
"There are two possible attitudes to this observation."
"One attitude is to accept the Müller report, which, based on an apparent concern for efficiency, sees in the financial provisions of the new article 28 of the treaty, a need to increase the communitarization of the whole of the CFSP, by reinforcing the powers of the Commission, and of course, the powers of the European Parliament, within the framework of a new inter-institutional agreement."
"But if this Parliament is really concerned about the efficiency of the CFSP, and not only concerned with increasing its powers rapaciously, it should recommend a different attitude in order to overcome the contradiction between the institutional nature of the CFSP, and its method of financing."
"If the intergovernmental nature of the CFSP is really, as we believe it is, a necessary condition in order for it to be in touch with reality and efficient, the priority is therefore, above all, to preserve its intergovernmental nature, its control by national parliaments and therefore, to set up a method of funding which is coherent with it, without however, increasing the overall amount of expenditure devoted to the CFSP by the various Member States."
"25 % of the operating expenditure of the CFSP is already directly financed by the Member States."
"This percentage should be increased to cover all its expenditure."
"It is therefore particularly important to emphasize, during the ratification debates which will take place in our various countries, the need to correct the division introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, as soon as possible, by finding the required technical solution so that the conditions of funding of the CFSP are suited to its intergovernmental nature."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to welcome Mrs Müller's report which has sought in a very practical way to deal with some of the difficulties we have to face in implementing CFSP actions and suggest some improvements."
"I should like today to deal with three key questions which can be asked about the CFSP and its practical implementation, the first of which is what have we done so far to tackle the points made by the Court of Auditors in its report."
"Secondly, what is our approach to implementation of the interinstitutional agreement of July of this year?"
"Thirdly, what is still to be done to improve CFSP joint actions?"
"In looking at the general context of the CFSP, we should not forget that the power to take CFSP decisions lies with the Council."
"It is, after all, the Council that decides on joint actions and it then decides how they should be financed."
"It is the presidency that is responsible for implementing them, as is very clear by article J5 of the Union Treaty."
"It is only because the costs of the actions are charged to the general Community budget that the job of administering them lies with the Commission, as provided by article J11 of the Union Treaty."
"This division of responsibilities has created problems in the past and the Court of Auditors has identified them in its report."
"So what have we done in 1997 to tackle the points made by the Court?"
"In the first place, the Commission has asked the budget authority for credits to be made available to prepare properly each joint action and it has obtained them."
"In the 1998 budget ECU 500, 000 should be on the line B 8014."
"Secondly, in addition to that, the Commission has drawn up a special specific financial sheet for the CFSP which encodes the global context of each action, including financial contributions from the Member States and also from other international organizations."
"Then the Commission has been able to make improvements on the management of special envoys."
"I welcome the recognition that Mrs Müller has given to this point in her report, paragraph 4, and there was also a reference to special envoys during the course of the debate."
"I now turn to the question of our approach to the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Thanks to the interinstitutional agreement on the financing of CFSP, the delay for implementing a joint action will, in my view at least, be substantially reduced."
"For example, there is no longer a budgetary reserve."
"Nonetheless, the Commission still thinks it is desirable for the budgetary authority to have an upstream control on expenditure when a joint action is being decided."
"We think that should be done on the basis of the specific financial sheet that has been drafted by Commission services."
"Finally, what still has to be done to improve CFSP joint actions?"
"Mrs Müller stresses the need to associate the Commission at the very beginning of the preparation of each joint action in recital Q of her report."
"That is a point which is raised by the Court of Auditors as well."
"I can only repeat that in our view it makes operational sense for the Commission to be associated well before the adoption of every joint action."
"There is some overlap in the budget between CFSP credits and other credits such as mine-clearing or electoral process actions."
"Sometimes the Commission wishes to make a political gesture by giving resources to international organizations."
"We must not let the Council forget that needs to be carefully controlled, monitored and evaluated."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 19: 55)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"Ladies and gentlemen, a very, very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to one and all."
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I indicated at the beginning that I wanted to speak on the Minutes."
"I just wanted to say that page 26 of the Minutes indicates that before the vote on topical and urgent motions for resolutions I pointed out to Mr Cot that only the joint motions were available in all languages and not the motions on which they were based."
"Mr Cot replied that this was an exception, and that there had been translation problems."
"I made further enquiries at the documentation service afterwards, and they specifically told me that a decision had been taken that the text of original motions on which joint motions were based was no longer to be translated and made available."
"I must protest against this, although I am all in favour of economy measures, as it is always possible for us to reject a joint motion, as has often happened, which means voting on the original motions."
"We must therefore insist that the original motions should be translated and made available in good time."
"Mr Posselt, I have made a note of your comments and I will ask that this issue be re-examined."
"Votes"
"Mr President, it emerged from yesterday's debate that we considered it desirable for the opinion to be published in the Official Journal, but that does not alter the actual text."
"This is an insertion into paragraph 7, and I understand that it reflects the rapporteur's intentions."
"I have also spoken to other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control about this."
"This insertion, which is the subject of an oral amendment by Mr Fabra Vallés, does not cause any problems and is not being opposed."
"I would therefore recommend that we accept this oral amendment."
"Mrs Müller has asked me to say that she fully agrees with the oral amendment."
"Does Parliament have any objection to my putting the oral amendment from Mr Fabra Vallés to the vote?"
"I do not see any, so I can put it to the vote, together with the entire motion for a resolution, for which we have no amendments."
"It is approved."
"Mr President, an oral amendment has been proposed."
"You have asked if there are any objections."
"There are none. However I still think that it would be more correct to vote first on this oral amendment before voting on the whole report."
"Personally, I am in favour of this oral amendment, however I have considerable reservations about the report as a whole."
"I will therefore ask you to proceed to the vote on the entire report as usual and also for the oral amendment."
"Even on the last day of the session this year!"
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I am trying to simplify the work of Parliament and not to insist on formalities when I see that there is general agreement."
"But, if you wish, I have no objection to holding another vote to confirm this."
"The vote was held, with the oral amendment, as is often the case."
"I saw that the entire Chamber was in agreement and there was not a single objection."
"Let us now please vote on the amendment."
"(Parliament adopted the proposal)"
"Mr President, the conditions under which we are proceeding to the vote have led me to speak."
"Thank you for agreeing to my request. However I would have hoped that you would have us proceed formally to the vote for or against the report."
"I would like to say that the report by Mrs Müller is given over to a very important report from the Court of Auditors on the functioning of the common foreign and security policy."
"This is an area of the European Union where spending decisions are made at intergovernmental level."
"As I say, expenditure is decided and the major decisions are taken at intergovernmental level, even though the Community budget is often called upon."
"The report also indicates that some 75 % of spending is taken from the Community budget, so of course our Parliament concludes that not only should it be included in decision-making, but also in the whole process of spending control."
"Recently, in conditions which were open to criticism, an interinstitutional agreement placing itself within the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty was adopted, and this agreement aims to alter the conditions in which this common foreign and security policy is implemented."
"We were critical of the implementation of this interinstitutional agreement."
"And what is more, we are criticizing Mrs Müller's report because it has a perspective which is much more ideological than financial."
"Quite often the reports from the Court of Auditors, which provide us with information enabling us to measure the degree to which community funds are sometimes employed less than strictly, give rise not to criticism on a financial basis, nor to financial reform proposals - as they ought - but to ideological proposals. And this is true of the present report."
"This is why, Mr President, we have voted against, although that will not be obvious thanks to the conditions in which we have proceeded to the vote."
"The report presents a number of institutional views on the Common Foreign and Security Policy as well as views of a more general institutional character to which we take exception."
"These include, for example, that the system of changing Council Presidencies every six months complicates and impedes the continuous implementation of and supervision of joint actions."
"We believe quite categorically that there must and shall be a right for every Member State of the European Union to occupy the presidency on a rotational basis as the case is today."
"We have all heard of proposals for one-year EU Presidencies consisting of a large, a medium-sized and a small Member State."
"There is no doubt that such proposals conflict with the principle that every country is equally qualified to occupy the position of President."
"Just because a country is a large country, that does not mean that it is more qualified to be the holder of the title of President."
"We therefore also believe that the CFSP should continue to have the character of an intergovernmental cooperation."
"Furthermore, it is suggested to the Member States that they set up a CFSP personnel reserve for joint actions."
"Firstly, this disregards the express desire of many Member States to remain neutral, and secondly, it should be up to the individual country whether it wishes to participate in a joint action; there is nothing automatic in that."
"The CFSP, the common foreign and security policy of the European Union still has not really got off the ground, four years after the Treaty of Maastricht entered into force."
"Concrete experiences, such as the EU administration of Mostar, the European electoral unit for the Palestinian elections and the EU action in Bosnia speak for themselves."
"As far as the latter is concerned, the European Parliament has, in the context of the second reading of the 1998 budget, expressed its concern about the implementation of EU financing for actions in connection with the return of refugees to Bosnia."
"But it is not only the European Parliament which is concerned about the implementation of the CFSP."
"The Court of Auditors does not hesitate in its advice to take stock of three years' experience with joint actions as part of the CFSP, and to point the finger at continuing weak points and failings."
"The core of the CFSP problem is the conflict between the exclusive powers of the Council to approve CFSP actions, and the authority of the European Parliament to release the necessary resources for these."
"As rapporteur of the report on the funding of the CFSP as far back as 1994, I pointed to the existing area of tension between substantive authority for the CFSP, which is in the hands of the Council, and budgetary power."
"At the time I warned urgently that no one benefits from a persistent, permanent squabbling between European Parliament and Council."
"EU citizens are not the least bit interested in an endless discussion about who is responsible for what part, but want to see a Union which operates efficiently, and which also carries out its responsibilities to the outside world by means of a powerful foreign policy."
"Does this mean that between 1994 and now, absolutely nothing has happened?"
"Have the difficulties concerning the EU administration of Mostar, the European electoral unit for the Palestinian elections, and management of budget appropriations of the post of High Representative for Bosnia led to nothing?"
"Were the numerous discussions of the Committee on Budgets, during which it was asked to make available financial resources for CFSP actions on the basis of flimsy and extremely ill-founded information, a measure for nothing?"
"The answer, in my opinion, is no."
"The International Agreement of Amsterdam offers considerable progress with regard to the financing of the CFSP."
"Clear rules must better set out the respective powers of both partners in the budgetary power, Council and Parliament, and bring about the necessary interaction between the two."
"That way financial resources for realistic requirements of the CFSP can, in future, be released more quickly and more efficiently."
"But that is not the end of the matter."
"The Court of Auditors rightly points out in its well-founded evaluation, a series of issues in which the CFSP is remiss, particularly:"
"Lack of transparency."
"Information is available on policy expenditure paid from the EU budget (90.94 %); there are still problems with administrative expenses and the Member States' contributions."
"As far as the latter is concerned, except for a few measures, there is little or no information about the contributions which were paid out by Member States or other donors.-The half-yearly rotation of presidency of the Council sits uncomfortably with the need for continuity in the administration of a joint action (a concrete reference to Mostar).-There are still shortcomings in the Commission's management of the CFSP.-Lack of clear separation criteria which means that too often there is an overlap between the objectives of the CFSP and the responsibilities of the Community in the sphere of development cooperation."
"This translates into a lack of cohesion in the management of resources which does little for budgetary transparency.To put right these shortcomings the interinstitutional agreement might have to be specified more precisely."
"On this point I fully endorse the conclusions of the Müller report."
"The only thing I would like to add is that this will only succeed through a pragmatic approach."
"Specifically referring to budget powers, this means that the European Parliament may not abuse its authority over the financial aspect of the CFSP actions."
"Commission, Council and European Parliament (both the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control) must, by means of intense and constructive cooperation, gave shape to a powerful CFSP."
"Labelling of genetically modified soya and maize"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"B4-0908/97 - O-0139/97 by Mrs Breyer and Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on labelling of genetically modified soya and maize products; -B4-0909/97 - O-0141/97 by Mr Florenz, Mrs Schleicher and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on labelling of products made from genetically modified soya and maize; -B4-0910/97 - O-0143/97 by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on implementing provisions for the labelling of genetically modified soya beans and maize; -B4-0912/97 - O-0145/97 by Mr Pasty and Mr Azzolini, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms; -B4-0913/97 - O-0154/97 by Mr Eisma, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, -B4-1003/97 - O-0164/97 by Mr Papayannakis and Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the labelling of genetically modified soya and maize; -B4-1006/97 - O-0170/97 by Mr Souchet and Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, on the labelling of products made from genetically modified soya and maize."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to a regulation regarding the labelling of genetically modified products."
"My quote is from article 37 of our regulation on statements and oral questions which states that a committee, a political group or a minimum of 29 members can table a motion for a resolution."
"My colleagues, Édouard Des Places and Dominique Souchet, tabled a motion for a resolution last week within the correct time period and in accordance with the regulation, yet now the Conference of Presidents decides that there will be neither a resolution nor a vote."
"We believe that this decision is completely contradictory to the regulation and we regret it all the more because this is the second time this has happened this week."
"In effect we were refused a vote on the Commission's statement - which we considered to be very negative - on mad cow disease."
"This occurrence is symptomatic of a worrying problem."
"The European Parliament keeps asking for more power but does not dare to vote on resolutions if it thinks that it might oppose the Commission."
"My group would like to express clearly its disagreement with the report on banning products at risk and the policy regarding genetically modified organisms."
"So, Mr President, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, we would ask for a vote on the resolution which we had tabled following the correct procedure."
"Mr Berthu, I think that we have already had a debate on this issue."
"The Conference of the Presidents of the Political Groups came round to this way of thinking, as you yourself have said."
"Your group is represented at this Conference and of course, regardless of the position of the Conference, which I think was a unanimous position, from what we have been told, you could have tabled a motion for a resolution without being bound by the Conference of the Presidents of the political groups."
"Mr President, the decision of the Conference of Presidents was not unanimous."
"I was representing my own group and I very firmly opposed the decision."
"In my opinion, the Conference of Presidents was not entitled to take this decision as it contradicts the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Berthu, as you can understand, I am not here to answer on behalf of the Conference of Presidents of the political groups."
"There are presidents of the political groups here, who could take up the matter."
"But my impression is that this debate is now closed."
"Mr President, this was an initiative by the Green Group in the European Parliament because, although the novel foods regulation has been in force since 15 May, the Commission has been keeping us waiting, saying that there would also be provisions for genetically modified maize and soya. But what has happened?"
"Nothing! When are you finally going to stop your delaying tactics towards consumers and towards this Parliament?"
"How much longer do you intend to keep consumers in the dark?"
"When are the Commission and the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs finally going to agree on clear labelling of maize and soya?"
"Mrs Cresson, I see that you are with us today."
"In other contexts we are always hearing about the latest progress in genetic engineering."
"Why has DNA analysis not been accepted, when it is very much state-of-the-art?"
"Why has the Commission suggested protein analysis, which is very old-fashioned?"
"Are we to believe the rumours that only a voluntary agreement by industry is planned?"
"What is happening about baby food?"
"Are we going to endorse the Scientific Committee for Food's opinion and exclude novel foods from baby food, including maize and soya?"
"Why does the Commission not let the producers come up with the analysis method?"
"Why are millions of ecus of taxpayers' money being wasted, with the analysis methods being funded from the public purse?"
"Why can you not make a proposal at last?"
"When is the proposal on additives, flavourings and enzymes coming?"
"When is the veil of secrecy finally going to be lifted?"
"When can consumers and we here in this House expect a meaningful proposal on the labelling of genetically modified maize and soya products, which is what both we and consumers want?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we put this topic on the agenda because we wanted to make sure that something was finally done."
"The Commission then brought forward a proposal on 3 December, after we had already set the wheels in motion."
"I have looked at the explanatory statement for the regulation, which was adopted without reference to the Parliament, as the joint Committee for Foodstuffs is responsible for it."
"I was amazed."
"We have been arguing with the Commission for nearly half a year, and the Commission has always said that it was not necessary to adopt a special regime."
"Now, in points 8, 9 and 20 of its explanatory statement it has used precisely the argument that we have always put forward."
"I do not quite understand that."
"I am grateful that the Commission has now seen its way to doing this, but I would like the Commission to explain to me why it battled for so long against the Parliament's ideas."
"We naturally support the DNA checking envisaged by the Commission, subject - as Mrs Breyer has just commented - to the analysis method to be used for this check being prescribed at the same time."
"This is the only way to make this proposal practicable and to ensure that proper information is forthcoming."
"The European Commission's Standing Committee on Foodstuffs had a very intensive session on this proposal yesterday involving the Member States, and it now looks as if the Commission and Council will make a decision in January."
"This will clear the way, at least in the case of the labelling of genetically modified soya beans and genetically modified maize, for the provisions of the Regulation adopted on 19 September 1997, which came into force on 1 November 1997, but whose implementation subsequently had to be delayed until 1 February 1998, to be implemented by the Member States by the new deadline."
"We welcome all this, but why has it taken so long?"
"However, I have a few more questions for the Commission."
"First of all, I would be grateful if the Commissioner could tell us something about the outcome of yesterday's meeting of the Committee on Foodstuffs."
"My second question is this: this year's soya and maize harvest in the USA has finished, but we can assume that genetically modified products are already on the way to Europe or are even already in Europe."
"What is the Commission's estimate of the risk that genetically modified maize and genetically modified soya will be exported to Europe mixed with conventional products, without the necessary approval for marketing in the countries of the European Union under Part C of the 1990 Directive?"
"How many applications for such marketing approval have been submitted to the European Commission?"
"How will the Commission ensure that a decision can be reached in good time on all pending applications for marketing approval?"
"Does the Commission have an idea of the extent of deliveries of such organisms to Europe from the USA and Canada?"
"How does the Commission rate the risk of trade conflicts with our North American trading partners, if products cannot be marketed in the European Union without approval for the parts containing genetically modified organisms?"
"I am conscious, Commissioner, that you are probably not in a position to answer all my questions in detail today."
"But I would like to put these questions to you and I would be grateful if they could be answered by the beginning of January."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we have put these oral questions to you today because we think that the Parliament needs to be provided with comprehensive information on genetically modified foodstuffs at an early stage, and certainly at an earlier point than is usually the case."
"The fact that you were unable to arrange for the Regulation to come into force on 1 November because the provisions required for implementation were not available, and that you therefore had to delay this until February, was bad not only for consumers in Europe, but also for European industry."
"In the case of foodstuffs to be distributed within the internal market, uniform regulations about labelling as a whole are needed before these foodstuffs are produced."
"This is necessary both for industry and for consumer protection."
"I fail to understand why this has taken so long, given that the novel foods regulation was finalized in the Conciliation Committee over a year ago, that it has been in force since May and that it has been clear since then that transitional arrangements would have to be made for maize and soya."
"I would also suggest that we should consider now, before the new agreement between the institutions comes into force in early summer next year, whether the Parliament could be given information earlier and more promptly, so that it does not have to go to great lengths to have proposals drawn up for discussion in the Commission's Standing Committee on Foodstuffs."
"What I would like you to tell me, since you are responsible for science and for the Joint Research Centre, is the following: what progress has been made on work to develop an analysis method that can be used throughout the Union to test for genetic modification of DNA, and to what extent is the Joint Research Centre involved with this work, given that it has already developed analysis methods for a whole string of food products using ring tests, thus ensuring uniformity within the Union, rather than leaving things to chance?"
"I do not think that we can just leave this decision to industry alone."
"In this connection, I would like to ask you another question, Madam Commissioner. Would it not be more meaningful, instead of introducing a scheme whereby a product can be marked 'may contain genetically modified ingredients' , to determine a threshold value and stipulate that the labelling 'genetically modified foodstuff' or 'non genetically modified foodstuff' can only be used above that threshold?"
"In Austria we had a case of contamination."
"It is particularly easy for soya and maize transported in railway wagons to be contaminated, even it is only by 1 %, so it is better to say that there is a threshold value than to label something with 'may contain' and make consumers uncertain."
"Madam Commissioner, I think all these questions will have to be answered very quickly if we really want the arrangements to be adopted by all Member States in February and implemented by industry then."
"It is high time that a proposal to this effect was brought forward covering everything that the consumer needs to know and everything that industry needs for producing and labelling its products."
"Mr President, could you please ask the Commissioner to pay attention while we are speaking; it makes communication easier."
"It is not only the consumer and industry who continue to be confused about the use of genetically modified organisms in food."
"The European Parliament, all of us here, also frequently have to ask for clarification."
"Hence the debate this morning."
"It is becoming increasingly clear to me that the Commission is still not quite sure what policy to follow as regards genetically modified organisms."
"It produces regulations with timetables which industry not only finds difficult, but which leave it at a loss, too. The most important question this morning is why the Commission did not produce the regulations for implementation earlier: it has taken this long for there to be a temporary proposal."
"For industry a somewhat unworkable situation has arisen, with many uncertainties."
"More importantly, the there is still no guarantee for the consumer when buying products, as to whether they contain genetically modified ingredients or not."
"Therefore my group feels that the situation which has arisen is unacceptable."
"Labelling is extremely important."
"We believe in free choice for consumers as long as the labelling provides them with sufficient information."
"Consumers will have to be able to decide for themselves whether to buy genetically modified foods or not."
"It is up to the Commission to ensure that information on labels becomes statutory, and that it can be established by means of a reliable method whether a product contains genetically modified organisms."
"It is this method which has caused so much confusion."
"Initially, a majority of Member States, and the Commission itself, appeared to opt for the so-called protein method, and yet in the recent proposal the Commission suddenly chose the DNA method - also to the amazement of the Standing Committee for Food which met yesterday, or so I heard."
"It looks as if the recent draft regulation is too unclear for industry to be able to start labelling products in a responsible way."
"I would therefore like the Commission to explain why it opted for this new method, and to hear when it intends the implementing regulation to come into force."
"To put it mildly, Mr President, it is well overdue, and I ask the Commission once more to fulfil its responsibilities at last, because it has been extremely remiss."
"Mr President, I think at this stage in the debate, in the light of the contributions by other Members who have expressed their concern, which is no more than the concern of ordinary people, there is little more to be said and I do not intend to waste the time I have."
"We had also submitted a question which basically expresses the same concern as our fellow-Members' questions, and that is: why do we not put these implementing measures into practice, why do we not have analyses approved at European level, and why do we not have proper labels which will enable consumers to choose?"
"The United States says that the European Union is putting obstacles in the way of importing genetically-modified products and that the European Union bases its actions more on public opinion than on scientific evidence."
"We think the anxiety manifested in European public opinion is reasonable."
"It has become sensitive as a result of other food problems."
"But in addition to that, the recent approval of the possibility of producing genetically-engineered maize in France gave rise to the publication in the Spanish press, and I think in the European press, of the statement that this maize will contain three genes: one with a toxic product to deter insects, another that has a product which is resistant to antibiotics, and a third which has a product which is tolerant to herbicides."
"It is reasonable for European public opinion - and any opinion - to be concerned about the effects on health of any of these products."
"For these reasons proper labelling and an appropriate implementation are essential."
"Madam Commissioner, it is probable that the change taking place in DG XXIV to safeguard the safety of food is a step in the right direction, since there is provision for a risk analysis unit whose basic objective is to analyze the risks to human health that each of these products represents."
"In any event, Madam Commissioner, I believe that all our fellow-Members here have expressed a reasonable concern on the part of the people of the European Union, who do not want to take the risk of consuming products which are a health risk."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be with you today and to have the opportunity to clarify the situation regarding the labelling of food products which come from genetically modified soya beans or maize."
"This is of course a very complex subject and I may not be able to meet your expectations and answer all your questions. However, if you are in agreement, we will use this session to review the Commission's position, since you - quite rightly - have put questions to it on this issue."
"I will not go back over the history of the case, since you are as familiar with it as I am, but I will respond directly to your questions which in some cases deal with the same issue."
"Firstly I will address the first series of questions about the legal situation at the time of the entry into force on 1 November 1997 of the Commission's Regulation CE 1813/97 from September 19, 1997."
"Regulation 1813/97 which came into force on 1 November establishes rules for additional labelling for food and ingredients which are produced from genetically modified soya and maize."
"This regulation applies directly to all Member States and therefore it cannot be considered that there would be any shortcomings on this issue."
"Operators are bound, as of 1 November, to label their products which are not equivalent within the meaning of article 2 of Regulation 1813/97/EEC."
"As regards the adoption of detailed labelling rules for these foods or ingredients, the Commission, at the meeting of the Permanent Committee on Foodstuffs on 31 July 1997 undertook to present them as soon as possible; it also indicated on this occasion that it would consult the Scientific Committee on Human Diet for its opinion on the concept of non-equivalence which had been put in place by the regulation mentioned above."
"This consultation and the desire to work together with interested parties, as well as the evaluation of different approaches which could be used, all explain the time we needed to take before adopting the relevant draft regulation."
"And so I can fully appreciate the impatience felt by some of you which is entirely justified, but this method of proceeding obviously required a certain amount of time."
"Another series of questions refer to the interpretation of the concept of non-equivalence and, more particularly, to the criteria selected to trigger the labelling of food produced from genetically modified soya beans and maize."
"Article 2 of Regulation 1813/97/EC, which repeats article 8 of Regulation 258/97/EC relating to novel food products, states that the final consumer must be informed of all food characteristics or properties, such as composition, nutritional value or the nutritional effects, or the use for which it is intended, stating that a food product or ingredient is no longer equivalent to a food product or ingredient which already exists."
"As a result, the foodstuffs and ingredients produced from genetically modified soya bean or from genetically modified maize which are not equivalent to their traditional counterparts are subject to labelling requirements."
"The key concept of non-equivalence has been defined as evidence of a scientifically demonstrable difference which goes beyond the natural admissible variations."
"At the same time, on 23 July 1997 the Commission made public these general guidelines on labelling for modern biotechnology. They recommend, on the one hand, labelling requirements when the origin of a product can be scientifically verified as GMO, that is ""genetically modified organism' , and on the other hand the need to define clear rules for labelling to enable official controls to be carried out which are reliable, reproducible and practicable."
"If we take into account both the concept of non-equivalence, and the approach recommended by these Commission guidelines, it appeared at this stage that the presence, in foodstuffs and ingredients of foodstuffs, of DNA resulting from genetic modification is the criteria which responds best to the requirements mentioned above."
"Therefore on this basis the Commission approved, on 3 December, a draft regulation which established detailed regulations for labelling which apply to foodstuffs and ingredients made from genetically modified soya beans or maize."
"This draft was discussed in the Permanent Committee on Foodstuffs on 18 December and proposed for voting in this committee in mid-January."
"I should tell you that, at the Permanent Committee on Foodstuffs which met on 18 December to exchange views on the draft proposed by the Commission, a majority of Member States was opposed the draft!"
"They prefer the protein criterion and the establishment of a list of products to be included on labels before the products to be included on the list are specified."
"This draft regulation proposes that the foodstuffs and ingredients produced from genetically modified soya beans or maize which contain DNA resulting from a genetic modification are not equivalent in the sense of article 2, point A of Regulation 1813/97/EEC and therefore are subject to labelling requirements."
"However those which no longer contain DNA, notably due to its destruction by successive stages of processing, are not subject to these requirements since they must be considered to be equivalent to their traditional counterparts."
"However, as the possibility has not been scientifically excluded that methods of food production can permit the elimination of all traces of DNA, whilst leaving proteins present, the DNA approach was supplemented in order to cover this case, which is still theoretical."
"Moreover, the draft provides for a standard formula for labelling without a possible alternative to facilitate the consumer's selection and information and to avoid different interpretations within the European Union of the possible equivalence of formulas which could create new difficulties in the internal market."
"This indication will be formulated as follows, and I quote: ' produced from genetically modified soya ', or, and I quote again 'produced from genetically modified maize' , respectively."
"This should appear in the list of ingredients in brackets immediately after the name of the ingredient concerned."
"This note could also be added legibly to the bottom of the list of ingredients, printed in characters of at least the same size as those used for the list of ingredients proper."
"For those products which do not have a list of ingredients, the necessary information must appear clearly on the product label."
"This regulation does not affect the right of operators to include voluntary statements on their product labels in addition to those set out by this regulation, on condition that these statements are in accordance with the clauses of Directive 79/112/EEC, which stipulates that they must not mislead the consumer."
"This is also true for statements concerning the absence of foodstuffs or ingredients made from genetically modified soya or maize, or statements concerning the presence of such foodstuffs or ingredients in cases where this cannot be scientifically verified but the proof is available by other means."
"The mixture of products which contain genetically modified organisms with conventional products is not banned by the ruling."
"However, Council and European Parliament Regulation 258/97/EEC provides for this possibility, notably for bulk deliveries, and states that, in this case, the consumer information on the possible presence of genetically modified organisms in foodstuffs is supposed to satisfy the labelling requirements in the aforementioned regulation."
"According to this approach, the draft regulation concerning labelling of foodstuffs and ingredients made from genetically modified soya or maize allows for the possibility of including the following on the label, and I quote: ' may contain, for products in which the presence of material produced from genetically modified soya/maize cannot be excluded, nor be proven' ."
"In addition, this note conforms to the general guidelines of the Commission on labelling of modern biotechnology."
"This formulation will avoid the separation of products and the obligation to test each consignment which may combine these products in different amounts, whilst also enabling the consumer to choose whether to buy these products or not."
"In response to the important question which deals with imports of genetically modified products from the United States or Canada, in accordance with the clauses of article 43 of Directive 90/220/EEC, the Member States are bound to see that this directive is observed, in other words they are responsible for monitoring the conformity of products containing genetically modified organisms which appear on the market in the European Union, and must see that the relevant authorities organize inspections and, if necessary, other control measures in an adequate way."
"On 3 December, at its twenty-second meeting, the committee responsible for Directive 90/220/EEC requested that the Commission put in place harmonized control and inspection measures."
"An ad hoc technical working group for inspections and control measures for genetically modified organisms was set up."
"On 16 December, this working group looked at the availability and applicability of specific technical methods to detect or identify genetically modified organisms and their derivative products which would not have been granted authorization for voluntary dissemination with a view to their being put on the market."
"Today, thirteen products are the subject of notification within the framework of part C of Directive 90/220/EEC."
"During the revision of Directive 90/220/EEC, the Commission decided that any product in the process of being authorized under the current directive must undergo an examination by the relevant scientific committees before being approved by the Member States in the regulation committee for this directive."
"As the opinions of the scientific committees will not be available until the end of January and as it would be appropriate to follow the procedure of the regulation committee for Directive 90/220, it seems unlikely that the Commission envisages the adoption of these authorization decisions before mid-March 1998."
"Between the fourth term of 1996, the date of the first change, and 31 May 1997, it has been indicated that 8, 300, 000 tonnes of soya beans and 650, 000 tonnes of soya powder entered Europe from the United States. 2 % of this originated from genetically modified organisms, in other words 166, 000 tonnes of soya beans and 13, 000 tonnes of soya powder."
"Imports of Novartis maize made up some 0.6 % of the total maize imports from the United States (4, 422 tonnes)."
"The Commission has always endeavoured to ensure that Community legislation conforms with international obligations and this means that the risk of disagreement on commercial matters is avoided as far as possible."
"It is not the role of the Commission to comment upon the interpretation of the rules of international business as provided by our commercial partners, nor upon their opinions on the conformity of European Union legislation with the above rules."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, I have responded to your serious questions as best I can."
"It is clear that the debate will not end here."
"However I would like to say that the Commission is very vigilant."
"Of course the various consultations take time, but we will continue to work on this together, I hope - even though there are differences within the Member States as we have seen in this last session - and we will unite our efforts to reach a universally satisfactory solution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner."
"Even if the various opinions expressed do not always totally coincide, the European Parliament seems to consider that it has already said the last word on the need for clear and full labelling of foodstuffs and ingredients affected by genetic engineering."
"If that were true, today's debate would be superfluous and a repetitive waste of time."
"However, my view and that of my group is that this debate is urgently needed."
"We are unhappy about the way the Commission is handling the sensitive subject of labelling genetically modified foods and the scant regard it pays - sometimes at least - to Council and Parliament regulations."
"We as Members of the European Parliament are being criticized from all quarters when it is the Commission which is actually at fault."
"The European Commission has let our citizens down by causing confusion about the labelling of genetically modified foods."
"It is not acceptable to stipulate justifiably demanded labelling requirements in a regulation and then not implement the regulation."
"As a consumer, I assumed back at the beginning of this year that we had passed a turning point with the novel foods regulation."
"I assumed that novel, and in particular technically modified, foodstuffs would be clearly and fully labelled."
"Not a bit of it!"
"The relevant products containing genetically modified maize and soya are no longer considered new."
"The attempt to improve matters by means of the Regulation that came into force on 1 November has not helped."
"It does not include the guidelines on implementation needed to ensure a uniform protection level throughout the European Union and legal certainty for manufacturers and traders."
"And it gets worse."
"Regulation 81/13 will not even come into force, instead it will be replaced by a further amended version."
"How can you explain all this to the average consumer?"
"Madam Commissioner, I believe that the type of labelling that you have described is correct."
"But you have not answered the following questions: why could it not actually come into force on 1 November, given that we had been discussing the novel foods regulation and labelling for over five years?"
"There was time enough for preparatory discussions and clarification, even if it was not quite clear at the outset what form it would take."
"But it was always evident that labelling would and must come."
"So why was that not possible?"
"Why is it not possible until 1 February or even March, when so many new products will already be on the market?"
"If this regulation does come into force then, will it apply to products which are new at that time?"
"This issue has not been resolved at all."
"I would ask you not to forget the third point, the problems surrounding methods of detection and analysis."
"Suitable methods do in fact exist for detecting genetic modification of maize and soya products."
"So even if it is slow to act, the Commission has no justification for denying consumers any longer a comprehensive labelling system consistent across all Member States."
"From the consumer's point of view, there is now nothing to stop comprehensive labelling of our food, and it has everything going for it."
"That is why my group is being so tenacious about this."
"Consumers ought to be making purchasing decisions armed with proper information, not at the mercy of bureaucrats."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we, the European Parliament, decided upon full labelling of novel foods with the implementation of the novel foods regulation, so that consumers would be given the option of making their own purchasing decisions."
"I would like to remind you that we resolved to provide consumers with information about all the characteristics and nutritional properties of food products, such as composition, nutritional value and intended use, which distinguish genetically modified food from conventional food."
"Labelling of foodstuffs produced using genetic engineering does not amount to some kind of health warning as far as I am concerned."
"I see it rather as being essential if society is to accept and trust new technology."
"Nevertheless, labelling does give anyone wanting to steer clear of genetically engineered products for any reason the option of deliberately avoiding them."
"I should stress again that our overriding concern must be to ensure that consumers are not exposed to nutritional deficiencies or other health risks through the consumption of novel foods and ingredients."
"These products should only be put on the market once three requirements have been met: first, these products should not represent any danger to the consumer; second, there should be no attempt to mislead; and third, they should not be so different from conventional foodstuffs that when eaten normally they can result in nutritional deficiencies."
"Because of the wide variety of products covered by the novel foods regulation, they generally need to be considered case by case."
"The Commission has attempted to set out the arrangements for genetically modified maize and soya in its draft Regulation."
"The Commission's proposal stipulates that genetically modified products must always be labelled if they contain genetically modified DNA."
"This method is bound to lead to the labelling of more foodstuffs than if proteins only had to be checked."
"The label for any foodstuff containing genetically modified DNA or modified proteins must include the following words in the list of ingredients or in another clearly visible place: ' Produced from genetically modified maize/soya' ."
"Even so, the analysis method suggested by the Commission is not compatible with the novel foods regulation or with the Luxembourg Summit Declaration."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to amend its proposal so that the labelling scheme under the novel foods regulation is fully and comprehensively implemented."
"Any limitation of the labelling scheme put forward by the European Parliament is unacceptable as far as I am concerned."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, as has been very clearly shown in these talks, the labelling of packaged genetically modified soya and maize has become a serious problem, which could have been avoided by the Commission and which now we must address without delay."
"In this respect I consider the Commissioner's response was very timely, although I must say that there are still very many questions left unanswered and there is still a lot of work to be done before we can talk of safety with regard to this very serious matter."
"It was obviously a mistake not to have implemented legislation on the new food, before genetic maize or soya came on to the market."
"Consequently, these products can now be marketed with no clear labelling on the packaging, which has led to uncertainty, confusion and understandable concern, as different Member States have gone their own way in the matter, which has caused even more confusion."
"As Madam Commissioner remarked, the regulation which came into force on 1 November was absolutely vital, but I have to say, the work of the Commission had lagged badly behind, there being no proposals for enforcement."
"None at all."
"Like many of my colleagues, I cannot but wonder why no proposals or guidance were given before the decree came into force."
"Now the situation remains vague and awkward for both industry and the consumer."
"Manufacturers do not actually know what they ought to be labelling or how."
"We are also still in the dark as to scientific criteria which could decide, for example, whether a genetically modified product corresponds exactly to the original."
"Thus, labelling requirements must be brought in for scientific evaluation to take place."
"Madam Commissioner, in her response, stressed that the end-user must have clearer information."
"We all agree on this, certainly."
"The consumer has to have clear and comprehensible information on the quality and content of a product before he or she can make a conscious, free choice."
"For this it is essential that labelling is unambiguous and as simple as possible to understand."
"Too much detail can obscure what the consumer needs to know."
"However, alternative and supplementary labelling can give essential information, especially when a type of food or ingredient might contain a genetically modified product or products, although it cannot be proved with certainty or ignored either."
"This, however, must appear on the labelling."
"All in all, both the food manufacturer and the consumer have a right to more precise information to increase food safety."
"And further research needs to be done on the combined and cumulative effects of genetically modified ingredients and products on the whole food chain."
"Mr President, almost a year ago the Parliament approved the work of the Committee on Conciliation on the novel foods regulation."
"At that time we were the only group to express any serious reservations and indeed we then voted against the regulation."
"And now, one year later, I see that our reticence, which was more than just reticence - a serious criticism in fact - has turned out to be justified."
"The Commissioner has confirmed what we said: that the notion of substantial equivalence was completely confusing and ill-defined."
"What is a foodstuff which is substantially equivalent?"
"We still do not know this today and our fears have been confirmed."
"Secondly, as regards labelling, article 8 of this regulation was riddled with deficiencies and today these seem even more blatant than they were a year ago."
"Of course I do not necessarily mean to say that we are the heroes of the piece, but I am delighted that everyone is now saying the same thing as us."
"As regards the situation today, we can confirm that we are in a legal vacuum, and on this I cannot agree with Mrs Cresson."
"We have a legal vacuum now, because we do not know what this substantial equivalent is."
"We are struggling to keep up with a high-speed train, and we have no hope of catching it unless we make some radical changes."
"Consequently, I would like to draw attention to the fact that consumers have never asked for genetically modified foods."
"Amongst my acquaintances, I know of no consumer who wishes to have genetically modified foodstuffs, especially those modified to resist herbicides."
"And what of the scientists?"
"Well, one year on, many scientists are posing new questions and raising new doubts: notably, herbicide tolerance means that the vegetables concerned accumulate these herbicides within their organisms."
"Not a word has been said about this!"
"There is nothing in the regulations, we do not know what this could do to our health, nor do we know what effect it could have on the environment."
"Two Member States, Luxembourg and Austria took a courageous stance."
"I note that others are now hesitating and questioning their original ideas."
"NGOs and health and environmental associations are stepping up their intervention against the situation."
"So what has the Commission to say today?"
"I would like to thank Mrs Cresson for making a speech which was perfectly correct, at least as regards information, for now we are up to date."
"But she is proposing labelling based on the detection of modified DNA or modified proteins."
"But how many foodstuffs will be labelled which are made from genetically engineered soya and maize?"
"I would like to know the exact figure!"
"I can report that the 2 % of genetically modified soya in the consignments imported from elsewhere, according to my information sources, will be around 15 % this year."
"Soya consignments are already here and so is the next crop, so the problem is growing."
"We still haven't solved the problem of additives, flavouring and extraction solvents."
"And so my conclusion is that we are about to make a big mistake by adopting a method based on the analysis of finished products."
"What we need - and it is our leitmotiv - is a system of certification of origin with product traceability so we can give the consumer real information about the origins of and about the use of genetic engineering in the products which end up on his or her plate."
"I think this is essential."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, genetically modified organisms have entered the European Union and the Parliament can only lament this state of affairs."
"In this context, the labelling motion is only a minimal measure."
"Two aspects of this question should make us increase our vigilance."
"Firstly, labelling of genetically modified organisms and the observance and control of this, secondly, the circulation of living genetically modified organisms, their cultivation and the risks which they could spell out for the environment of which we are an integral part."
"As far as labelling is concerned, we know that in order to inform the consumer we need the means by which to detect genetically modified organisms in a product and we need to be able to measure genetically modified organisms."
"And yet, in spite of the excellent account you provided, Madam Commissioner, notably concerning the DNA approach, recent highly credible scientific articles reveal that the methods which enable us to check foodstuffs have not been perfected, indeed they are very expensive and depend greatly on information provided by the inventors."
"And - let us not delude ourselves - any research done blindly will be very dangerous."
"I do not wish to be a prophet of doom, but I think that this regulation which my group will approve because it is necessary to do so, will be hard to apply."
"Basically, as regards the distribution of genetically modified organisms, both they and transgenesis have created a situation never before known in human history: man's introduction of modified genes into cultivated plants, and indirectly into wild plants."
"Although the risks of cross-fertilization are slim for maize, which has no equivalent in the wild, at least within Europe, the same cannot be said for rape-seed, which is related to the cabbage plant and the mustard plant, nor for soya which belongs to the legume family for which the risk of cross-fertilization is absolutely guaranteed."
"Furthermore, the introduction of insect-resistant genes will make parasites more and more resistant, until eventually we find ourselves without any further biological defences."
"Let's not allow ourselves to be overwhelmed too easily by these techniques in the name of the progress which benefits a few multinationals, without having really measured their effects and without applying the indispensable principle of caution."
"This is what European consumers want - and they are quite right in this."
"My fear is that the labelling in question will be like a plaster on a wooden leg."
"Creating separate procedures for genetically modified organisms seems somewhat unrealistic to anyone who knows the least thing about production, transport, stocks and the processing of agricultural products."
"In five years' time, genetically modified organisms will be everywhere, in our vegetables and cereals, all in the name of the sacrosanct globalization of trade."
"So, to ensure that European consumers can still aspire to the legitimate choice of natural foodstuffs, the least the European Union can do for now is to support biological production consistently."
"In the meantime, let's follow Austria's example with its labelling policy."
"Mr President, in the short time I have I would just like to say that the whole area surrounding the labelling of genetically modified foods is one of the greatest challenges we face today in the European Union."
"We must be prepared to face the maximum challenge from those countries, especially America, who quite clearly have a vested interest in developing and promoting this new area."
"I personally am opposed to such a policy being adopted within the European Union."
"We do not need this new technology to produce more food into a market which is already oversupplied."
"As someone who has had first-hand experience of the BSE crisis where ingredients were placed in compound feed which were not up to the standard one could have had expected, I find it hard to believe we are now going to create a new monster with genetically modified food."
"I do not believe there is any demand anywhere in the European Union for the widespread use of this genetically modified food."
"I feel we must exercise extreme caution in any decisions relating to this area."
"We must also ensure that grain or any other material developed in this area is not imported into the European Union."
"Mr President, I am very glad that this debate is taking place this morning."
"I am also very happy that, while exercising maximum caution in the approach to genetically modified foods, this Parliament is prepared to move substantially from the totally negative position adopted by most MEPs two years ago."
"Against this more open-minded background, I wish to make a few points."
"Firstly, from the environmental viewpoint, the use of varieties which genetic alteration has made more resistant to soil-borne and air-borne diseases has drastically reduced the need for herbicides, fungicides and other chemical plant protection product which leave very damaging residues in the soil."
"These genetically modified varieties will make decisive contributions to feeding the world's rapidly growing population."
"Secondly, genetically modified foodstuffs are now a fact of life, whether we like it or not, in the US and Japan, and have been tested over multi-generation cycles, have been cleared for safety and efficacy and, indeed, have long since entered the food chain and the international food-trading market."
"Thirdly, genetic engineering is achieving, in a very short period, even better results than plant breeders could achieve through conventional propagation and crossing methods over years of trials, thus enhancing food values, proteins, starches, oil contents and yields and, most importantly, offering the prospect of better uptake of soil nutrients, thus requiring less fertilizer."
"However, this debate is about labelling."
"I recognize that decisions have already been taken but labelling may well be only a short-term or, at least, a medium-term solution to the use of genetically modified products."
"I am not sure about its long-term value."
"It seems to me to have two fundamental flaws."
"Firstly, labelling food such as soya beans, which are used in thousands of food preparations, is not practical."
"Sometimes very small quantities of soya are used, for example in sauces and soups. These small quantities are further diluted to almost non-existence."
"Labelling in this type of circumstance would be meaningless and, in any event, would be impossible to identify or evaluate in any test."
"If it is not possible to measure, then the rule on labelling will be brought into disrepute."
"Secondly, establishing special labelling requirements for products which have been fully tested and found to be completely safe, seems wrong to me and makes bad law."
"Either there is something wrong with the foods in question, in which case they should be banned, or they are safe, in which case no special rules are required."
"Genetic modification has been part of food production since the beginning of agriculture."
"Cattle breeds are different because the gene pool to which they belong has been modified through selection for certain characteristics."
"Genetic modification by itself is not harmful and it is wrong for us to confuse the public by suggesting that it is."
"Finally, I believe that within an ever-increasing global market operating under WTO rules, which, by the way, the EU is strongly supporting, this differentiation will become irrelevant, if not a complete nonsense."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the Commissioner said that we need more time, but I would like to say that the time is already up."
"Developments in industry and research have actually overtaken us politicians."
"Consumers have every right to know what they are eating."
"History proves that."
"We have the BSE crisis behind us, or at least mostly behind us, and we have the experience of that crisis."
"It is therefore natural that there are demands like this on the part of consumers."
"As the people's representatives, we must ensure that consumers get reasonable information."
"The question, however, is whether it is realistic at all today to think that we can have a comprehensive labelling system."
"I would very much like to elaborate on what Mr Lannoye said about equivalence."
"We still do not know what is equivalent to ordinary food."
"The problem is also that we already have so many genetically modified organisms in the system that we will soon be forced to put labels on almost all food, at least all complex foods, to say they may contain genetically modified organisms."
"That is not, of course, satisfactory, because for a long time consumers have been saying that they want to know when genetically modified organisms are included and, if they are, how dangerous it is."
"We have not been able to give answers to these questions."
"On the other hand, I would also like to pick up on a little of what Mr Gillis talked about, namely that we have in fact worked on modifying the genes in crop plants and domestic animals since we left the hunter-gatherer stage around 10, 000 years ago."
"We have always looked for strange plants which could be better than those we have."
"The very existence of maize is an example of this."
"We heard Mrs Barthet-Mayer say that maize has no cousins."
"No, instead it is by some kind of strange chance that we grow maize; it should not really have existed, but even nature is very strange sometimes."
"I believe it is important for European agriculture for us to be able to use the same means of production, the same methods of production as other countries in order to remain competitive in the long term."
"But if we are to use gene modification in our production, consumers have to be able to feel safe, otherwise it is impossible."
"Through tardiness and a lack of clarity, consumers, producers and scientists are all now in a quagmire in which consumers do not know what is dangerous, and producers and scientists do not know what it is they should be looking for."
"Mr President, I am sorry to say 'I told you so' , but the Green Group in the European Parliament argued back in January that we could not vote for this regulation without an implementing regulation, because it would not then be sufficiently clear how it would be implemented."
"If you buy a pig in a poke, as our colleagues here have done, then you should not be surprised if you end up with a mess."
"If think it is shameful, Madam Commissioner, how the wishes of consumers have been trampled upon."
"You have not made it clear today when labelling will be required."
"You have again brought equivalence into the debate, which makes me worry that a little back door is being kept open to mislead consumers."
"Nor have you said when there will be clear labelling for additives, flavourings and enzymes."
"In the absence of such labelling, over 80 % of these foodstuffs will still be subject to secrecy, even if there is DNA analysis, and that cannot be in the interest of consumers. We have to be open with them and offer them the option of making up their own minds for or against."
"Mrs Schleicher also asked which products had been notified and approved under the novel foods regulation."
"Madam Commissioner, in your reply you referred to the directive on deliberate release - but that was not the question."
"May I therefore ask you once again which products have already been notified and which other products we can expect in the near future besides genetically modified maize and soya."
"Nor did you reply to our question about positive labelling."
"There are a great many industrial companies and traders who would like to meet consumers' desire for clear labelling, including labelling of products that have not been genetically modified."
"Just when can we expect labelling criteria to be available for these products?"
"Now to my last point. Mrs Cresson, you told us that there is no labelling regulation because the Member States opposed it."
"I think that you should name the guilty men, the Member States who were against it, so that we in the European Parliament can cooperate with those Member States who are in favour to win over the ones continuing to block consumer protection and ride roughshod over health protection."
"Madam Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Austria genetic engineering is meeting widespread resistance."
"The scale of this protest is evident from a petition for a referendum which was supported by 1.3 million people."
"Consequently, the Austrian government has in the past reacted extremely sensitively to EU regulations which make it easier to use and release genetically modified plants."
"The reason for this often justified mistrust is no secret - genetic modification affects a clearly visible part of our citizens' lives, their food."
"Consumers want to know what they are eating, otherwise they lose faith in food products."
"To prevent this happening, an important step is to create a system for labelling genetically modified foods so that all consumers can immediately see what they are putting on their children's plates."
"It must say on the outside what is inside, it is that simple."
"That is why I wonder if it is not tantamount to deceiving consumers if labelling is only required once a discernible amount of modified proteins is present, that is, above a specific limit value."
"Should labelling be compulsory as soon as there is a difference from natural products, or only once the difference is detectable?"
"As genetically modified products are in any case supposed to be an exception, I would also like to know when there will be positive labelling for conventional products as well, or whether a comprehensive and panEuropean uniform labelling system is envisaged only for modified products."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments on this very important subject with great interest and would like to thank you for your part in this discussion."
"I have occasionally had the impression that what I said was not always heard - maybe because this is a passionate debate, and rightly so since it concerns a fundamental issue such as public health."
"So I will repeat what I said earlier, that is that operators are bound, as of 1 November, to label products which are not equivalent within the meaning of article 2 of Regulation 1813/97/EEC."
"Clearly it is up to Member States to check that these products are labelled."
"In response to what has just been said, there is no threshold."
"As soon as there is even a trace, labelling is obligatory, even if the trace is not very clear."
"The indications have been formulated clearly, as follows, and I quote: ' Produced from genetically modified soya or produced from genetically modified maize' ."
"It could not be clearer."
"Only a trace is required, there is no threshold amount."
"And this formula which clearly explains, in sufficiently large letters, that the foodstuff is produced from genetically modified maize or soya seems sufficiently clear to me."
"Just now, someone said that there were no positive indications."
"But this is not the case, and I said so earlier."
"There are positive indications for the statements concerning the absence of foodstuffs or ingredients produced from genetically modified soya or maize, or the statements concerning the presence of a certain foodstuff or ingredient in cases where this is not scientifically verifiable and the proof is available by other means."
"We have also looked to provide positive indications."
"In response to other observations, I would like to say that labelling does not concern the finished product, but the ingredients."
"So, each time an ingredient containing - I will say it again - simply a trace of a substance which can be considered as having been genetically modified is found in an end product, this information will be provided on the label."
"The Commission has chosen the criterion which is most scientifically reliable - DNA - and which is also the most product-specific."
"Unfortunately this point of view is not shared by the Member States, as we have seen during the meeting which has just been held."
"So it is true that the discussions of the Member States run the risk of prolonging the debate."
"Of course this regulation will be hard to apply, as mentioned earlier."
"It will be hard to apply because this is a difficult area, but we must proceed in a scientific way in order to develop methods of detection."
"Science never stops moving forward hand in hand with the new discoveries that are made, and we can observe both the positive aspects of this and sometimes, fatally, the negative aspects."
"However this is the crux of the problem, and in my opinion it will remain the big issue in the years to come."
"During the last few decades there has been total confidence in science, but this is no longer the case."
"Science and the progress it makes - which is clear from the prolongation of human life - can also bring threats."
"Consumers must be informed about these threats and in this I share your viewpoint completely."
"So, as far as I am concerned, the Commission - we can always criticize it, it is used to being a sort of scapegoat - has done its duty by stressing to Member States which support the DNA criteria - the broadest criteria - that labelling must be clear, that progress must be made rapidly, and that even if there is only a trace of the product, it should be mentioned."
"Of course all this will take time because different committees must meet, because Member States cannot be brought together overnight and because they cannot agree amongst themselves."
"So this debate is far from over."
"However you can be sure that the Commission will be extremely vigilant in taking precautions where the health of consumers is concerned."
"Mr President, I would just like to ask the Commission very quickly if it will seek to establish where infringements of these labelling requirements take place."
"If Mrs Cresson wishes to reply, I invite her to speak."
"Mr President, I will be happy to respond."
"As I said before, it is in fact the Member States which are responsible for the application of the regulation."
"So, as far as breaches of the regulation are concerned, the Member States must take action."
"Naturally if shortcomings were noted, the Commission would intervene as usual."
"The joint debate is now closed."
"Interim agreement with Uzbekistan"
"The next item is the report (A4-0304/97) by Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on theproposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part (COM(96)466-10521/96 - C4-0082/97-96/0236(CNS))."
"Mrs Mann will deputize for the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I am delighted to introduce this report on behalf of Mr Wiersma, for whom I have the greatest respect."
"He cannot be here today as he has important business in Holland, and I offer his apologies."
"A Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Uzbekistan was signed on 21 June 1996, but it will only come into force when it has been ratified by the European Parliament and by the parliaments of all the EU Member States."
"An Interim Agreement was initialled on 17 July 1996."
"The European Parliament has been asked by Council for its opinion on this agreement, in a simple consultation."
"Uzbekistan is an important partner of the European Union in the central Asian region, and it makes political and economic sense to have a trade agreement with Uzbekistan which will facilitate the development of reliable and also to some extent regulated relations."
"Uzbekistan will be the second central Asian state, after Kazakhstan, with which we will sign an Interim Agreement. The most important goods for Uzbekistan's economy and trade are cotton, gold, oil and natural gas."
"EU enterprises are already engaged in tough competition with US, Turkish, Korean and Iranian companies."
"Trade with the European Union increased by 30 % in 1996, admittedly from very low levels."
"Community exports rose by more than 60 %, resulting in a balance of trade surplus of some 180 million ECU."
"A more balanced trading relationship would be of particular interest to Uzbekistan."
"There are substantial problems with reform of the finance sector."
"The IMF and the World Bank have provisionally suspended payments on loans granted to Uzbekistan."
"Under the Tacis programme, the European Union is supporting projects that can act as a model for the reforms needed."
"This includes support under the Tacis Democracy Programme."
"On 14 November 1996, the European Community and the Republic of Uzbekistan signed an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters, aimed at speedy implementation of the trade provisions contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 21 July 1996."
"The Interim Agreement falls under the exclusive competence of the Community, whereas the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement has to be implemented by the Member States, which experience has taught us is very timeconsuming."
"But there is one problem, and this, as so often, is in the field of democracy and human rights."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, or to be precise its draftsman, Mrs Anne AndréLéonard, recommended suspending a decision on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement until spring 1998, as the democratic and human rights position in Uzbekistan is regarded as extremely unsatisfactory."
"The situation of both the media and the various NGOs, and also that of the very popular Islamic figure Obidkhon Nazarov is regarded as extremely unsatisfactory and was the subject of a very negative assessment in the last Human Rights Watch report."
"So we find ourselves in a situation where once again this Parliament has to try to strike an appropriate balance between the need to promote economic stability in an East European country and the need to support democratic movements and democratic stabilization."
"We have discussed this situation on several occasions before, so it is nothing new to us."
"However, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy considers it necessary to conclude the Interim Agreement, as a general improvement and stabilization of trade conditions can also lead to improvement and stabilization in the democratic situation."
"The Committee on Budgets also shares this opinion, and you can of course take it that our rapporteur, Mr Wiersma, also subscribes to this assessment on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Like the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the Interim Agreement also includes the human rights clause."
"It is an agreement on trade-related matters and does not offer a formal framework for a political dialogue on democracy and human rights, as the Community does not have any delegated powers in this area, as Commissioner van den Broek commented in a letter to Mrs Castellina, the chairperson of the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Although the Joint Committee does provide an opportunity for a dialogue on democracy-related issues, the correct framework for this has still to be identified."
"It will, furthermore, be an important task for the Commission and the Council to formulate and define such a framework."
"In the case of Kazakhstan a successful solution has of course been found."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to make a determined effort to use the opportunities available in the Joint Committee."
"However, I must point out that the Interim Agreement contains a suspense clause, which is an innovation in comparison to the 1989 agreement originally concluded with the USSR."
"This clause enables the Community to threaten Uzbekistan with the suspension of the agreement, should its human rights record significantly deteriorate."
"But we should only consider using this clause if there is a fundamental deterioration."
"We should not regard it as a mechanism to be used at the slightest provocation."
"Once again, the rapporteur, Mr Wiersma, despite various reservations, recommends that the Parliament should approve the conclusion of the agreement."
"This agreement will allow us to cooperate more closely and will facilitate a rapprochement of common values."
"That is what we want to achieve."
"I therefore hope, ladies and gentlemen, that you will feel able to support Mr Wiersma on this occasion"
"Mr President, rapporteurs Wiersma and Mrs Mann have formulated their recommendations to enter into an interim trade agreement with Uzbekistan convincingly."
"Such an agreement would contribute to the bringing into effect of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in July 1996."
"The interim agreement contains a reference to a democratic form of government and human rights."
"This is goes without saying to us, but the reports we are receiving about it are not positive."
"I think that the members of the committee would like the Commission to give us more information about this as soon as possible."
"The interim agreement may be able to strengthen European cooperation in achieving the objectives."
"Applying sanctions in the event of aggravated violation of human rights remains a possibility."
"The question I would like to give some thought to concerns the improvement of the economic situation as a result of the interim agreement."
"When I asked a compatriot what he thought of it, he summarized his opinion, based on experience, in one phrase."
"He said: trading with Uzbekistan is very smooth, trading in the country is very difficult."
"Uzbekistan specializes in exporting raw materials."
"We all know when it concerns gas, oil, and so on. But the balance of payments is largely determined by the price of gold and cotton on the world market."
"However, the foreign reserves allow far-reaching reforms in the country itself."
"Most European insurers of public credit do not cover Uzbekistan."
"In those places where it does happen it does so at the expense of the state."
"Inflation remains high, as do interest rates; the banking system leaves something to be desired; the central bank does not appear fully to understand its role, there is little progress in the development of trade; the government's grip on the economy continues to be strong; the market economy is underdeveloped."
"Bearing all this in mind we can follow the rapporteur and agree to an interim trade agreement."
"Approval of a partnership and cooperation agreement requires much time."
"It may take a long time."
"The Interim Agreement may nonetheless help to speed up evolution for the better."
"This is extremely important for both Uzbekistan and Europe."
"Mr President, the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously agreed to support Mr Wiersma's report and thus the Interim Agreement, because it considers that it would not only be wrong but also very dangerous to isolate Uzbekistan at a time of serious crisis."
"We must take every opportunity to develop this country and to build up a strong relationship with it."
"This is not just for economic reasons, although they also suggest the same course."
"Uzbekistan has abundant resources of raw materials."
"After years of crisis, in 1996 the country experienced a modest growth rate of 1 %."
"However, in addition to economic reasons there are important political ones."
"Human rights have been mentioned here again and again."
"We must of course press for the observance of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"But we should not forget that Uzbekistan was a central Asian colony first of Russia and then of the Soviet Union, and suffered from classic colonialism, by contrast with the Ukraine, which Mrs Mann and I constantly deal with in the Committee on External Economic Relations, or to Belarus, which gives us serious cause for concern. These are European countries."
"Uzbekistan has the classic symptoms of an immediately post-colonial situation: a cotton-based single-commodity economy, over-reliance on world markets, an almost total absence of manufacturing industry, and a need to export raw materials which it cannot make use of itself."
"Combined with decades of effective dictatorship under a totalitarian system, this means that we cannot measure this country by our own standards."
"That is why I believe that we should refrain from being arrogant and simply say that we should apply the same yardsticks to this country as we would, for example, to an ACP country."
"Although the ACP countries already have many years of development and cooperation with Europe behind them, there are of course enormous deficits there too, and democracies are in a minority."
"We must therefore conclude this Interim Agreement, and we must develop an intensive dialogue and trading relationship with Uzbekistan. On the other hand, by virtue of the human rights clause and the 'suspension clause', we have an opportunity to use our influence systematically to support democracy, human rights, nationality rights and religious freedom."
"I rise to endorse Mr Posselt's comments."
"I certainly do not intend to oppose these proposals, but I would nevertheless like to emphasize that we in this Parliament fail to understand just what an enormous influence we can have, and what we can achieve in this area."
"I would like to mention in particular the case of Michael Arzinkov."
"Because he was an Islamic activist, he had his passport withdrawn and was forbidden to leave the country, and when he demanded his passport back, he was told that he would not be given it until he had submitted to a psychiatric examination."
"Mr President, these are the kind of facts that define President Islam Karimov's policies."
"As Mr Posselt has quite rightly said, it has to be recognized that this is a people which has been demeaned by years of suppression, so we need to give them our understanding."
"However, the fact that after our delegation there intervened the passport was at least returned demonstrates that we can achieve something!"
"For that reason, it might have a decisive impact if we associated the acceptance of this agreement - which I support - with a statement that there is still an enormous amount of catching up to do on human rights."
"This applies above all to religious rights, as Islam is very fiercely repressed there."
"For example, the calls of the muezzin are forbidden, a sign of extreme political persecution."
"Not to mention the fact that a whole string of leading Islamic figures, such as Mr Nazarov, are constantly locked up or threatened in their own homes, and their families subjected to various pressures."
"The same applies to Christians."
"For example, the Baptist representative, Mr Rashid Durebayev, has also been tried and may possibly face three years in prison."
"It is well known that conditions in these prisons are so fearful that people die from illness or mistreatment in a relatively short time."
"So I implore you, let us support this Agreement, but let us also make use of the influence that we can bring to bear."
"The case I have quoted demonstrates that Uzbekistan has a capacity for decency not only in religious matters but also on all other problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Wiersma for his report enabling the entry into force of the Interim Agreement with Uzbekistan."
"The positive approach to forge ahead thanks to this report, despite the decision to defer a decision on the partnership agreement, is accepted by the Commission."
"The objective of the Interim Agreement with Uzbekistan is to enable the implementation of the commercial clauses of the partnership agreement which was signed on 21 June 1996 incidental to the European Council of Florence and pending the ratification of the partnership agreement by the European Parliament and all the parliaments of the Member States."
"To date, this partnership agreement has been ratified by the national parliaments of five Member States. They are: Greece, Spain, Austria, Finland and Sweden."
"Uzbekistan represents a pole of stability in a region which could prove to be important in geo-strategic terms and which could soon be part of a wider Europe."
"It has proven to be a reliable and predictable partner and this has been noted by other partners, such as the United States, Japan and Korea."
"Today, Uzbekistan is seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union as a way of affirming its independence, notably from Russia."
"The entry into force of the Interim Agreement will enable and will favour the development of commercial relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan."
"These are already showing great promise."
"In the course of 1996, bilateral trade increased by around 30 % compared with the previous year, and Community exports registered a rise of over 60 %, thus consolidating a trade surplus of approximately ECU 180 million."
"Furthermore, it is likely that with its population of 22 million and its abundant cotton, gold and natural gas resources Uzbekistan will become an important partner for the European Union during the next few years."
"Many of our companies have already taken this on board and are operating over there against stiff competition from companies from America, Asia, Turkey, Iran and other countries."
"In this context, a swift entry into force of the Interim Agreement takes on even more significance."
"In addition, article 1 of the Interim Agreement contains clauses regarding respect for democracy and human rights."
"Several of you mentioned this point, and I would make special mention of the eloquent intervention from Mr von Habsburg whom I thank for his words."
"Thanks to these clauses, the Interim Agreement will permit discussion about respect for human rights, and if need be, will exert pressure on the Uzbek authorities if respect for human rights slips in this young and fragile country."
"If need be, the Interim Agreement could be used as a lever to push the Uzbek authorities in the right direction."
"In reality, the suspension clause included in the Interim Agreement enables the Community to threaten Uzbekistan with suspension of the agreement if the human rights situation deteriorates."
"In this instance, the questions relating to human rights could be examined formally by joint committees provided for in the Interim Agreement."
"In effect, these joint committees offer the opportunity incidentally to hold political dialogue with the relevant commissioner, Mr van den Broek, with the services of the Commission and with representatives of other institutions."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mrs van Bladel wishes to raise a point of order."
"Mr President, as Vice-Chairman for Human Rights I have just received word from the human rights organization in Angola, and this was confirmed by the UN, that people have been tortured and have died in dozens of provinces."
"Commissioner Brittan said at the end of the topical debate that human rights form an essential part of the Lomé Convention."
"These prisoners run greater risks."
"You would give me a much more peaceful Christmas if you were to ask the Commission or the Council to ask all parties in Angola to uphold human rights and observe the peace process."
"I would also like to wish you a Happy New Year, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mrs van Bladel."
"You may rest assured that the whole House shares your concern, that your comments will be recorded in the Minutes and that I will notify the President of our Parliament directly of that concern."
"UEFA decisions on Coca-Cola Cup winners"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on UEFA's decision not to allow the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup to take part in European cup matches ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is aware of the problems which UEFA's decision to bar the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup from participating in the UEFA cup causes small and medium-sized clubs which participate in this national competition."
"The Commission confirms that it is holding investigations to try to establish the facts in their proper economic context."
"These investigations are carried out as appropriate, within the framework of the procedures established by Council Regulation 17 of 6 February 1962."
"These procedural rules aim to guarantee the rights of parties to be heard and to give to third parties, whose interests could be affected by a Commission decision, the opportunity to highlight to their observations beforehand."
"The Commission has already received the observations of UEFA concerning this complaint and has also had a response to some questions which were put to it to clarify the reasons which formed the basis of the adoption of the rule in question."
"The assessment of UEFA's response highlighted the need to ask the Premier League and the Football Association of England to present their comments, both on the complaint and on UEFA's response."
"They were also asked to explain why this conflict could not be resolved at a national level."
"At the same time, the Football League was called to present its comments on the response from UEFA."
"The Commission has not yet received a response from the complainant nor from the two other organizations."
"It will not be possible therefore to take a position on the direction to take in this matter until we have assessed thoroughly the arguments of the parties involved."
"Owing to the procedural rules which must be respected and the limited resources of the services of DG IV, we do not envisage reaching this position for several months."
"In any case, the Commission would like to remind the honourable Members that, in terms of implementing the competition rules of the treaty, it cannot have as its objective to set itself up as arbiter in private conflicts of interest."
"It will ensure in the first instance that the public interest is respected, and this is associated with the restoration of a situation which is in accordance in fact and in law with articles 85 and 86 of the treaty."
"This action of the Commission as an administrative authority differs from the role of a civil judge whose vocation is to safeguard the subjective rights of private individuals in their reciprocal relationships."
"Mr President, Mr Ford, who has raised this issue on a number of occasions, has had to go to Luxembourg to speak so I am speaking on his behalf."
"I want to put this into some sort of context."
"UEFA were requiring the Premier League in England be reduced from 20 clubs down to 18."
"Because they were not prepared to do that, they withdrew the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup, the League Cup, from UEFA's competitions."
"The Coca-Cola Cup is, however, the responsibility of the Football League, not the Premier League."
"Therefore it seems ridiculous to me to prevent this competition having a team in the UEFA cup when in fact it is the Premier League with whom UEFA has a dispute."
"It is grossly unfair and I believe that it is against the letter and the spirit of European law."
"But it is not only unfair, it is extremely damaging and I will explain why."
"The bigger clubs in England, and I am told by Mr Miller, my colleague from Glasgow, that the same thing applies to Scotland, are sending weakened teams into this competition because they do not see a UEFA place at the end of it."
"As a result, you will inevitably get smaller crowds, you will get less television revenue, you will get less sponsorship and as a result of all that there will be an increased financial burden on the smaller clubs."
"Now Mrs Cresson was not actually correct in saying that it was the smaller clubs in this competition; certainly clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Leeds and so on are in the competition."
"But as the competition has evolved, because there is no UEFA place at the end of it, these clubs may well not only send weaker teams but eventually pull out."
"That will result in difficulties, problems and financial uncertainty for the smaller clubs."
"They are community clubs and there are also jobs at stake as well."
"So this might just sound like a football story, but it is a very serious issue."
"We think it is grossly unfair, we think it is illegal and we can see that unless something is done quickly - and I hope it is done quickly - some of these smaller clubs, because of the loss of revenue, may actually go to the wall."
"We have seen a number of these clubs do so in the past and therefore I would urge the Commission to move as speedily as possible to resolve this issue so that in future in England, in Scotland and perhaps in other parts of the United Kingdom, we get a place for the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup so that the competition is seen as a prestigious competition and we get the proper sort of television sponsorship and money from this competition for the good of all the smaller clubs."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Cresson for her statement."
"But I rise to speak in a very similar vein to the remarks by Mr Cunningham."
"This may be the last debate of the week and indeed the last debate of the year in this Parliament, but it is not on an obscure or unimportant issue."
"It actually touches on matters of major significance to Europe and Europeans: it touches on football."
"We deceive ourselves if we think the affairs of this Parliament are of more concern to millions of our citizens than football."
"Over the Christmas holiday there will be millions of European citizens going out to watch football."
"It is vital and crucial to them."
"They - certainly in the United Kingdom - will be looking to this Parliament and the Commission to deal with this problem."
"Football is in Europe."
"The development of European football competitions not only creates good sport that, again, our citizens enjoy, but it makes Europe more real for many of our citizens."
"We in this Parliament, therefore - and I would urge - the Commission have a responsibility to see that football can continue to operate in Europe and that all clubs have an opportunity to participate in European championships."
"Football is big business."
"We are not just talking about people kicking a leather ball about."
"We are talking about very substantial sums of money and big decisions that are going to have serious impact upon the clubs."
"We have to make it clear that we are not just talking about little local football clubs. We are talking about quite significant businesses that now operate in the various football leagues in the United Kingdom."
"Where there is professional sport there is a lot of money involved."
"The commercial rules that we would expect to apply in other businesses have to be made to apply properly and fairly in football as well."
"Having studied this matter it is quite clear, in my view, that UEFA is very definitely abusing its dominant position."
"When I contacted them and asked for information, all they were prepared to give me was the address of their lawyer."
"That always smacks, to me, of an organization that is not 100 % sure of its position or of its facts."
"In Britain, the Football Association and the League both support keeping the Coca Cola Cup winner in the European championship."
"Of course football wants and needs a league competition, but we should not forget that the grassroots teams in the lower divisions, who themselves want to participate in European football, like that opportunity."
"As Europeans we should say that is good."
"But they also need the revenue that comes from the Coca Cola Cup."
"It is estimated that something like 20 % of their revenue - some £32 million - comes from the Coca Cola Cup."
"If there is not the prize of European football at the end of it then they face the risk of losing television money, of losing Coca Cola sponsorship of that competition."
"So it is a serious matter for them."
"Most serious of all, I have received today a letter from Portsmouth Football Club."
"They say: ' Here at Portsmouth we feel that there should be another place in Europe for the winners of the Coca Cola Cup."
"Any move likely to bring pressure on UEFA will get our backing.'"
"Anything that gets the backing of Portsmouth Football Club gets my backing as well."
"Mr President, I am not sure that the Commission fully understands what is at issue here, and I would just like to make it absolutely clear to Mrs Cresson."
"One organization - the Football League - is being punished for the actions of another organization - the Premier League - over which it has no control."
"That discrimination is contrary to the principles of the Treaty of Rome and the principles of a single market."
"That is what we must focus on."
"As both Mr Cunningham and Mr Perry have quite rightly said, we must not underestimate the economic damage that will come from this decision."
"Clearly, playing in a competition, which at the end of the day brings with it a place in Europe, provides a major economic motivation for clubs."
"For the very big football clubs such as Manchester United in the United Kingdom perhaps that is not such a motivation."
"But clubs such as Bolton Wanderers, for example, need the revenue that could come from a successful cup run and a place in Europe, which is extremely lucrative, because not only does it bring participation and competition, it also brings television rights."
"Equally, lesser clubs in the football league, for example Bury Football Club in my constituency, depend on having matches played against the glamour clubs as well as on the prospect of themselves getting through to the final."
"If the glamour clubs do not participate, as is a possibility, or send out deliberately weakened teams, clearly they are not going to get the revenue for those matches which they depend on for their survival."
"In the light of the Bosman ruling, which I entirely support, the smaller clubs in the United Kingdom are struggling because of the loss of transfer fees."
"I hope the Commission will take this with the seriousness it deserves because this is a very important economic matter."
"Thank you, Mr Titley, but this presidency, catching today's mood, wishes to say that it regrets that while you nominated Madrid as a great team you forgot to mention the Barcelona Football Club."
"In any event, however, I am here to remedy the omission."
"I now invite Mr Wynn to speak for one minute."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by complimenting Mrs Cresson on containing her laughter when she was reading the script."
"I am sure to a lot of people it seems quite comical but it is an extremely serious issue."
"To make one other point, for those who are unaware of the issue, this is not an opportunity to give free publicity to Coca Cola in this Chamber."
"The question I wish to ask the Commissioner relates to the final comments that she made about the Commission not being the final arbiter in private conflicts - that was what I wrote down from what she said."
"Does that mean that, when the Commission gets the information from the parties involved, no action will be taken?"
"Is that what I am going to tell Wigan Athletic supporters?"
"Mr President, I do not have a great deal to add to what I said earlier; I can only repeat my earlier words and add a few details."
"I said that we put questions to the opposing parties, however the Commission has not yet received any response either from the complainant nor from the two other organizations."
"So how can the Commission adopt a position since we have not yet received any response."
"The Commission recalls that subject to the implementation of the competition rules - as this is a competition issue under the treaty - that it cannot have as its objective to set itself up as arbiter in private conflicts of interest, but must ensure that the public interest is respected with a view to restoring a situation which is in accordance in fact and in law with articles 85 and 86 of the treaty."
"As we do not have any information, we cannot make a response."
"When we receive information we will see to what extent the Commission may possibly respond to what appears to be, so far, a conflict of private interests."
"And I would add that in light of the procedural rules which must be respected and the limited resources of DG 4 which has a large number of issues to deal with, this position may not be reached for several months."
"I would like to take the opportunity provided by the President allowing me to speak to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, before the House rises may I take advantage of the privilege I have had of chairing this sitting to remind you that today, coinciding with the end of our work in 1997, the Year against Racism in Europe is also coming to a close in Luxembourg."
"Our work has no doubt been far from perfect, but it has positive aspects, and they include the contribution we have made to the fight against racism in the course of this year."
"It is also right and proper, ladies and gentlemen, that we should emphasize the fact that the most important contribution has come from European citizens and from non-governmental organizations."
"But as we go into 1998, some matters remain outstanding, and one of them is to continue the fight against racism."
"We are not so simple as to believe that a year of struggle will remove this ugly phenomenon."
"We know it is one which has many causes and we must continue the fight."
"Next year too, ladies and gentlemen, our tasks will include the continuation of our work to prepare our home for our new neighbours, that is to say to complete our democratic machinery, and at the same time to spare a thought for those millions of European citizens who have no jobs and tell them that the Luxembourg Council of Europe on employment will not be a matter of mere words, but the beginning of a road that will bring them to a point at which, next year, they can celebrate Christmas and the New Year with the prospect of work ahead."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I now have the pleasant duty of thanking our assistants in the House for their work this year and at the same time offering them my best wishes, beginning with the ushers, for their ostensibly modest work which they nevertheless carry out with a meticulousness which plays a key role in the smooth running of our Parliament."
"I would also like to mention the interpreters..."
"(Applause) ... those subtle filters who make it possible for us to talk with one another, notwithstanding the fact that we speak 11 different languages, and even sometimes to understand one another; our fellow-workers, the Presidents, to whom, furthermore, an apology is due from some of us Vice-Presidents, myself included, because very often when we take the Chair we spoil their extraordinarily good work."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should also dedicate a few words of affection and gratitude to the workers we do not see."
"Firstly, those who prepare the Verbatim Report of Proceedings and who, when we read our speeches afterwards, surprise us by giving the impression that they sounded better than they did to us when we actually spoke, without having altered anything."
"And the Info-session officials, who have the wisdom and ability to pick out the best and present it for the scrutiny of public opinion."
"But today may I single out one group in particular - our Parliamentary translators."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 4, 400 pages are translated in our Parliament every day."
"I do mean 4, 400 pages, representing the work of 32 linguists and 18 secretaries."
"This is a near-miracle which sometimes means they have to work for many nights at a time."
"I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we should send them a message expressing our thanks and congratulations with our Christmas and New Year greetings."
"(Applause) And last of all, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my best wishes to you, and thank you for allowing me to chair these Friday sittings, which have been so calm and pleasant, and at the same time so fraternal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a Happy Christmas to you all."
"Mr President, you have had the chance to wish us all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."
"As a native of Luxembourg - and a great deal has been said about Luxembourg summits - may I now take the opportunity on behalf of the Friday Club to pass on my festive greetings to you and wish you all a peaceful New Year."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Lulling."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.41 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a very happy New Year, and declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 19 December 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of 19 December 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, at the start of our last Parliamentary part-session, various Members from various political groups condemned the murder of José Luis Caso, a local councillor in the Basque Country. Also during that week, this House received a visit from the family of another local councillor, Miguel Ángel Blanco, who was also murdered some months previously, 48 hours after having been kidnapped."
"On Friday, Mr President, José Ignacio Iruretagoyena, a local councillor in Zarautz, was murdered."
"All of them were Basques, ""guilty' of having been democratically elected to represent their people - the Basque people."
"In recent days there have also been acts of terrorism in other regions of the European Union. People are demanding that we, the representatives of the European peoples, should not just issue a condemnation, Mr President, but also commit ourselves to initiative and to boosting Community policies to combat terrorism."
"What is at stake is the most basic of all human rights, Mr President: the right to live."
"Mr President, I do not want to spend too much time on this, but obviously, the loss of a human life - the despicable murder of a representative of the Partido Popular , Mr Iruretagoyena, in Zarautz last week - means that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are forced to repeat our condemnation of this type of act. Europe needs to develop an awareness of pacifist issues, in order to avoid a repetition of such acts."
"The Spanish people have repeatedly held demonstrations on this question."
"I believe that the rest of Europe supports us, as do the governments of the European countries, in our struggle against terrorism."
"Let us hope that in the building of Europe such acts - which are totally unjustified - can be completely eradicated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is painful to have once again to begin one of our part-sessions by reminding ourselves that, using the force of the word, we are pitted against the force of arms and the force of murder."
"Once again, Mr President, intolerance, violence and fascism have destroyed a life."
"The destruction of a life is always painful, but this was the life of a democratic representative of the people."
"It is a double murder: the murder of an individual and the murder of democracy."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to say that there is an ample majority in the Basque Country who are opposed to violence and fascism."
"They are witnesses to the fact that in the Basque Country and in Spain all opinions can be upheld, through democracy and coexistence."
"We have to tell the fascist minorities that we have already experienced fascism this century, disguised as the Right and also as the Left, and it does not fool us when it comes disguised as nationalism."
"We respect the wish of each and every people to defend their identity, as long as it is done by democratic means."
"Mr President, as a Member representing the Basque Country, I should also like to comment: firstly to express support for the family of the murdered man, José Ignacio Iruretagoyena, and also, on behalf on my party, for members of the Partido Popular , to which he belonged."
"However, he was not just a member of that party; he was an elected representative of the Basque people."
"Therefore, not only has ETA committed the heinous act of murdering an individual, but it has also committed the additional crime of killing a representative of the people."
"Nobody - not even ETA - can succeed in silencing the voice and the will of a people, not even using guns and bombs."
"So, besides expressing support for our colleagues in the Partido Popular and for the victim's family, I would also like to end on a note of hope: the voice of the people, democracy, liberty and human dignity can in the end defeat violence, bombs and guns."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Mr President, the Group Union for Europe fully agrees with the comments just made by our Spanish colleagues."
"We share their emotion and their indignation."
"We have never ceased to repeat that no political cause justifies murder, and we of course stand in solidarity with all those who, elected by the people, by democracy, are savagely assassinated by those who challenge the very roots of democracy, as Mr Gutiérrez Díaz has just said."
"Mr President, we request that you send our very sincere condolences to the victims' families and to the Basque people."
"Mr President, since we last met we have seen the arrest of former President Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia and the rather shabby treatment which has been dished out to him."
"Several governments have asked the Zambian Government to release him or charge him and, at present, he seems to be in a state of limbo."
"I should like to ask if you would consider writing a letter to Mr Kaunda, expressing the support of this Parliament, and also to the Zambian authorities voicing similar concerns to other governments?"
"Thank you, Mr Wynn."
"Order of business"
"Mr President, we all know that, politically, the European Commission is accountable to the European Parliament."
"It is an essential part of the democratic relationship we have in the Union."
"It is in the light of this democratic relationship that I would like to ask the Commission to give a short statement this week."
"It is stated in various newspaper reports that a difference of opinion exists within the European Commission about whether Members of the Commission have the right to accept political mandates during their membership of the Commission."
"To be more specific, according to newspaper reports, Commissioner Silguy is alleged to be going to stand in Brittany in March."
"According to these same newspaper reports the President of the European Commission, Mr Santer, is alleged to be opposed to Mr Silguy's seeking and accepting a mandate of this kind."
"My question is whether the Commission wishes to make a statement in which it clarifies its position in this matter."
"The question is the more important, Mr President, as it does not only concern relations between the Commission and this Parliament."
"According to the Financial Times of this morning, the French President, Mr Jacques Chirac, is alleged to have intervened personally in favour of Mr Silguy's right to seek a political mandate."
"If the French President gets involved in this discussion it seems to me that the Commission as an institution cannot remain silent."
"I would like to ask the Commission to make a statement by way of clarification."
"The Commission may have the floor, to express their view on this."
"Mr President, I wish to simply inform the House that it would be appropriate to put the business down for consideration."
"That would serve the interests of this democratic Chamber and also, of course, the requirements of courtesy as far as the Commission is concerned."
"Mr President, all I know about this case is what I have read in a few press agency telexes this afternoon."
"I think it is important that the European Commission gives an explanation of this in the European Parliament."
"I have read that consultation will take place in the confines of the European Commission, at least between the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, and Mr Silguy."
"But it is extremely important that we in this Parliament are informed as soon as possible."
"So I agree with the question, but I must insist that the European Commission is given the opportunity to define its position."
"As you know, the Commission has the right to make a statement, according to Rule 37 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Clearly, at least two political groups - the Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party - have requested the Commission to avail itself of that right."
"I am informed that the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left also support this request."
"The Commission will come to its own conclusions, and it is up to them to make that statement when they are ready to do so."
"I feel sure it is important for this to be done as soon as possible, for the sake of good relations between Parliament and the Commission."
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"White Paper on railways and rail freight freeways"
"The next item is the report (A4-0412/97) by Mr Sarlis, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Commission's White Paper ""A Strategy for Revitalizing the Community's Railways' , and the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, ""Trans European Rail Freight Freeways' (COM(97)0242 - C40269/97)."
"Mr President, the Commission's White Paper is a comprehensible, clear and comprehensive text and has been constructed on firm foundations."
"This commendation does not of course detract from the fact that there are disagreements about the analysis and the recommendations that the Commission makes."
"Firstly I must emphasize that the views, the proposals and the conclusions of the White Paper should not be surprising, given the fact that, to a large degree, they are in keeping and in harmony with the principles laid down for the first time in the 1965 Council Resolution No 271 and Regulation 1191/69."
"How and why both these statutes, which were made law 25 years ago, have to a great extent not been put into force is another story."
"There are two main points on which the Committee on Transport and Tourism disagrees with the proposals of the Commission: firstly, the Committee on Transport does not accept on the one hand the Commission proposal for immediate and unlimited liberalization of access to the railway network, and on the other, the proposal for a posteriori settlement of any problems that may arise on account of total Big Bang-like liberalization."
"Quite the contrary, the Committee on Transport is of the opinion that open access to the railway network must come about not all at once but progressively, step by step, in parallel with the taking of necessary accompanying measures such as those implemented in air and sea transport and telecommunications."
"The second point on which the Committee on Transport disagrees is on social policy: the Committee on Transport feels that the White Paper is short on recommendations of how to face the problems that will arise for working people, and also on the safety of rail transport following the completion of open access."
"With the resolution that you are being asked to rule on, the Committee on Transport is proposing various measures for the further training of personnel, for the mutual recognition of degrees and diplomas, and for the harmonization of working conditions, which we hope the Commission and Parliament will accept."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport agrees with many of the proposals of the White Paper, such as those relating to economic measures and to the revitalizing of the railways, those relating to services of mutual benefit, to the integration of national systems and, above all, those relating to rail freight freeways."
"Particularly as regards freeways, while we are in favour of creating such freeways with all possible speed, we would nevertheless wish to draw the attention of the Commission, but above all that of the Council, to the fact that particular care needs to be taken over the choice and backing of the first freeways, so as to exclude the possibility of the dissection of the rail network in the European Union."
"For this reason and in this regard, in our resolution we stress the necessity of there not being a beginning or an end point which would be determined by a single port of call, especially in the initial phase of the creation of rail freeways."
"We believe that rail freeways should be open to all, and they should have the possibility of being linked either from north to south or from east to west."
"For this reason we repeat once more that the issue of the railways, which we regard as urgent and about which we are in sympathy with the Commission study, must be looked at very carefully and very assiduously, since it is very easy for these rail freeways to prolong the dissection of the railways of the European Union."
"We must also be aware that the rail network of continental Europe still essentially reflects today the disagreements and differences that were prevalent in Europe in the nineteenth century."
"Therefore, by creating rail freeways, we must make very sure that this is the nucleus of the creation of a unified European rail network and not, as I said before, the beginning of the dissection of the railways on our continent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been studying the social issues connected with the general revitalization of the railways."
"As draftsman of the Committee's opinion on this subject I am pleased to see that the Sarlis report has dealt with the general social aspects of the public transport sector and has also included personnel issues."
"Let me make a few general comments on this subject."
"To do this, we must go back a little way into the history of the European railway industry to see the many instances of neglect which have led to the current need for revitalization and for the proper management of the social aspects involved."
"I would like to say something about this."
"Fundamental to any revitalization process is the ability to face up to economic reality - and this is an area in which the public authorities of the different Member States have often been lacking."
"Without doubt, this has in turn led to unfair competition between rail and road transport."
"We are attempting to rectify this situation at a time when environmental compatibility is at least being properly understood, when the advantages of rail transport are incontestable and when the appropriate framework conditions for freight transport in Europe have not even yet been laid."
"To me this seems absolutely absurd."
"Furthermore, I ought to mention that now the EU's eastwards enlargement has been given de facto approval, it seems to be essential that this project be given a pan-European dimension."
"This question is of special significance for the environmental management of the forthcoming transport agreement, particular the freight traffic agreement, as we anticipate the growth rates currently being forecast for this sector."
"As well as appreciating the full extent of this problem and the real need for a revaluation of the EU's railway services, we must not forget that safety has a vital role to play in all this."
"Better training of railway personnel must therefore be high on the agenda, and this must have a trans-border dimension."
"Such improvements are only sensible, yet the White Paper still makes no mention of them."
"This oversight also applies to many supporting measures and to those personnel who are involved in major revitalization projects - and it is one which must be remedied with immediate effect."
"Commissioner, this is not just wishful thinking, it is something which should be reflected in the policies we implement."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Sarlis for the hard work that he has put into this report."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Kinnock for the work they have done."
"The fact remains that whilst we all love railways and recognize the need for railways, there are severe problems within the European rail industry, problems that need to be addressed by us all."
"There are many areas in which we can agree with both the Commission and Mr Sarlis."
"We can agree that there is a need to revitalize our railway network, particularly in the freight sector."
"We can agree that we need to assure open access to that rail network, particularly for international cross-border freight."
"We need to wholeheartedly support the principle of the freight freeway, and the Commission has done very good work in establishing that particular principle."
"We also agree that we need to ensure that the existing directives, particularly Directive 91/440, which I have a personal interest in, is implemented in national law and implemented in the railway sector."
"The only point on which we differ slightly with the Commission is the speed or the timetable for introducing these proposals."
"In that regard we very much support Mr Sarlis' step-by-step approach, because we must ensure that any liberalization is accompanied by the social measures that are needed to protect those within the industry."
"Let us be under no illusion here."
"Unless we take action in the rail sector we are in danger of having no rail freight at all in 20 years time within our continent of Europe."
"That is a situation we cannot let go without taking the drastic actions that are needed."
"If we can get this balance right we could be at the beginning of a much needed renewal of the railways, we could be instrumental in giving the railways back the priority that they deserve."
"Mr President, the report we are debating today represents a great leap forward, because we are now closer to the highly desirable aim of liberalizing Community railways, in such a way as to permit their revitalization in terms of competition with other methods of transport."
"That is what the Commission is advocating in its White Paper, and we agree."
"The rapporteur, Mr Sarlis, deserves to be congratulated, because his work combines sensible doses of realism with the headstrong eagerness felt by many of us to see our railways modernized as quickly as possible."
"Proof of that realism is his insistence, and the fact that he concludes that such liberalization must be carried out gradually, to avoid setbacks due to counterproductive haste."
"By the same token, his proposed order of priority is entirely reasonable, dealing successively with international freight transport, national freight transport, and international passenger services."
"This point needs to be stressed: it will never be possible to achieve a high quality international passenger service, worthy of a modern European Union, without developing the relevant infrastructures."
"It is impossible to picture the European Union as a world pioneer, in keeping with the demands for progress which are to be expected of the twenty-first century, if we do not manage to achieve high-speed passenger links between the capitals of all the Member States, at the very least."
"Because of where I live, I regularly experience the deficiencies of the rail link between Madrid and Lisbon, and there are other capital cities within the Union which could be mentioned as further examples."
"Until we succeed in converting routes like Madrid-Lisbon to high speed, our railways will fail to enter the twenty-first century."
"To conclude, Mr President, I want to place on record that the rapporteur is also right to attach so much importance to social aspects, especially with regard to adapting the railways for the convenience of children, the disabled and the elderly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, once again we have the opportunity to cry out in pain and also, if we want to, to try to find a solution to several problems, in connection with Mr Sarlis' excellent technical report."
"We all know that in Europe in general and, unfortunately, in my country in particular, the railways are facing ever deeper crises."
"The statistics bear this out: over the last 25 years, the railways have lost 58 % of goods and passenger transportation, while road transportation has increased by 150 %; the passenger share has dropped to 4 % of overall transportation, and the goods share to 9 %."
"In view of this situation, I believe that the full and demanding transport plan for the trans-European lines can no longer be sufficient to point out the paths to be taken."
"So we have to ask ourselves: how have we reached this situation?"
"First of all, the initial cause is the appearance of other means of transport, certainly faster and also more economical; then the lack of management independence; and also bad management, particularly when assigned to public bodies."
"So what are the solutions?"
"It is difficult to mention them all in the space of a few seconds."
"Firstly, the sector should be opened up to free competition and to private operators; then we need to carry out business improvement and a general reorganization of the sector, and, in several amendments, my group gives a few specific indications on how to act; we also need to ensure the full implementation of Directive 91/440, favour the development of railway passes for goods transportation, provide greater inter-operability between the system and, finally and above all, implement works such as railway tunnels and trans-European projects, that are the keystone to many other problems."
"With regard to the central European region, I am thinking in particular of two main lines, Lyons-Turin-Venice and Monaco-Verona, of the north-south route, which would solve many problems But all the governments need to get involved in this."
"Mr President, senate deliberante perit Saguntum . We are here together, and beneath us the entire plan which the Commission presented so beautifully, which we have talked about so often and on which we actually agree, is falling to pieces."
"We in Europe are suffering from a traffic infarction, we agree overwhelmingly that we want to move traffic away from the roads onto the railways as soon as possible, and yet nothing happens."
"The freight freeways, assuming the Commission is right, are already doomed to failure, because every railway company continues with its own line, as ever, and says: no, we are not going to participate."
"SNCF does not want to participate. Ferroriale Statale , which owes the Italian State L6000 billion, does want not any stops on any part of its network, but wants journeys to be continued straight through to southern Italy."
"The Rotterdam-Genoa freight freeway is now doomed to failure."
"The previous speaker said it: road transport has increased by 150 % and rail transport has decreased by 75 %."
"With all due regard to Mr Sarlis' report, despite the Commission's good intentions, and despite the fact that we all agree (with the exception of Mrs Moreau, whose amendments amount to nothing and are wide of the truth) we are not achieving anything."
"The responsibility is yours, Commissioner."
"Mr President, the revitalization of the railways is a necessity, given the structure they provide within our societies."
"This revitalization is essential to provide an alternative to ""everything going by road' . The environmental damage and danger to safety that road transport represents are reaching limits which are unacceptable to the public."
"Unfortunately, the only way the Commission has envisaged revitalizing our railways is by completely liberalizing them."
"Mr Sarlis' report proposes achieving this in two stages which, apart from opening them up to competition, will leave only national passenger transport in place."
"We cannot agree to this."
"This liberal fixation, whether it be in one or two stages, is not likely to provide an answer to the challenge which has been raised."
"The rail transport sector has already lost 500, 000 jobs in Europe since 1985."
"Yet the White Paper only devotes a few anodyne lines to the social consequences of the policy to be followed, which Mr Sarlis rightly criticizes."
"In this regard, a balance sheet of how Directive 91/440 has been applied is necessary, and we are in agreement with the demand in Mr Sarlis' report that this balance sheet should be democratically drawn up, in coordination with the unions and passenger associations."
"By favouring more profitable services, opening up to competition risks shattering the coherence of national networks, and open access to freight freeways for all operators - which is demanded in the report - moves in this direction."
"A completely different orientation must be taken by substituting the destructive logic of competition with the constructive logic of cooperation."
"That is where efficiency lies, and it is not by chance that the first freight freeway in service - opened today, I believe - is the fruit of cooperation between French, Belgian and Luxembourg state networks."
"It is in the interests of the European Union to promote this perspective, enabling both the service and the supply of transport to improve."
"In this regard, just like the French Government, we are opposed to moving beyond Directive 91/440."
"Furthermore, the rail workers reject the ultra-liberal orientation of the Commission."
"Many workers' actions have taken place, with public support, and last November 10 000 rail workers from the European Union demonstrated in Brussels against the direction the White Paper was moving in."
"Our group will continue to relay constantly these demands, which highlight the urgent need to come up with a transport policy based on the development of public services and on cooperation, which encourages a quality rail transport system, accessible to the greatest number, and which respects the environment and creates jobs."
"Mr President, the revitalization of the railways is of crucial importance to the sustainable society in Europe."
"The developments in transport do not make us feel very optimistic, even though we have recognized for years the importance of changes in transport and of finding a way for us to organize it."
"In the densely populated centres of Europe, traffic grinds to a halt daily."
"The emissions of CO2 in particular are not getting any less, as we think they should, but in fact are increasing."
"In the near future, it is not only passengers who should get out of the car and onto the train, but freight which should go off the road and onto the railway."
"Unfortunately, our still extremely national railways are simply not ready for such an operation."
"Total liberalization looks like a an elegant solution, but causes tensions, particularly in the transport of passengers, as regards the responsibilities of public services."
"Besides, liberalization will not have a positive effect until all modes of transport actively foot the bill of the costs actually produced, including social and environmental costs."
"We should not have a situation in which one mode of transport does not have to pay VAT or taxes, whereas the other one does; because that leaves a big discrepancy."
"The White Paper's proposals for freight freeways can be called thoroughly positive."
"Their development will have a positive effect on the increase in the amount of freight transported by rail."
"For it requires - although we are not there yet - the demolition of national barriers and the creation of space for this form of transport."
"Priority for the development of these freight freeways will have to be primarily centred on transalpine transport, and on increasing freight transport between eastern and western Europe, so that there will finally be a proper solution to the problem."
"Mr President, the White Paper conveys very clearly the precarious position of the European railway companies."
"In 1970 the share of rail transportation in the total movement of goods within the European Union was still 31.7 %."
"In 1994 this share had dropped to 14.9 %, less than half!"
"The growth in freight transport has ended up entirely on the road."
"This development must be reversed."
"Citizens in EU countries are increasingly confronted with the harmful effects of road transport on the environment."
"What's more, in large cities, road transport is reaching its spacial limits."
"Roads are simply getting full up."
"In addition, in the near future, an even greater increase of goods transport is to be expected."
"We have to conclude that rail transport's biggest problem is the way in which the railway companies operate."
"Despite the fact that there has been one internal European market since 1993, the railways are still of a very markedly national orientation."
"Besides, they do not always work with the best interest of the market and customers in mind."
"I therefore support the remedy recommended in the White Paper, which is for there to be more competition on the railways."
"The Sarlis report, more so than the Commission, rightly points to the social consequences of restructuring the European railway companies."
"On 19 November 1996, tens of thousands of railway workers from the European Union demonstrated in Brussels against the European Commission's White Paper. They would not have done that without a reason."
"But we have to bear in mind two issues."
"Firstly, restructuring is necessary for the survival of the railways and the preservation of jobs."
"Secondly, the social consequences should not be absorbed by the European Union, but by the Member States."
"The Sarlis report does at least suggest that a European solution to the social problems is required, but it thereby raises false expectations."
"Setting aside the long time the rapporteur took to produce the report, another point of criticism against the report is the restrictions it wants to impose on road transport."
"The restriction requested in paragraph 7 on freight weight and the speed limits for road transport does not make rail transport any more efficient."
"Restrictions on freight weight is harmful for the environment as it will mean an increase in the number of journeys."
"The most remarkable proposal by the Commission is the plan for freight freeways."
"The first, from Rotterdam to Milan, was supposed to have started about now."
"When other Member States remain uninvolved, the Commission should take measures for limited liberalization, to which the Member States were bound back in 1991 by means of the directive."
"Mr President, the Commission's White Paper is full of the necessity for great foresight."
"The plans resulting from the White Paper for freeways for the benefit of freight transport is proof of the notion that words and paper are no longer enough."
"The report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to which my colleague Mr Sarlis has given his best efforts, shares the analysis made in the White Paper, but displays some reticence when it comes to the speed of the necessary restructuring."
"I want to say that the measures the Commission has in mind, and which in themselves are supported in Mr Sarlis' report, may be able to give the railways a new place on the map."
"In this, governments will play a different, but no less important role."
"What should not be allowed to happen in the meantime, is for the doors which are now ajar to be quietly closed."
"The splendid cooperation Mrs Moreau spoke of just now could be an example of this."
"This may have disastrous consequences for freighters, transporters, and also for society."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that I am very sympathetic to fears of the social consequences of such farreaching restructuring."
"But Commissioner Kinnock is right."
"Without the measures he has in mind, jobs will be lost on a very grand scale."
"Not only from the railways themselves, but also from the industrial railway complex that lies behind it."
"However, noblesse oblige ."
"The call for reform may put the concern about social consequences in the shade."
"When the Member States, the Commission and this Parliament all wish to give rail the future suggested in important speeches and important policy documents, employers should not be the ones to suffer, and suitable solutions must be found."
"An antisocial market economy has no place in the profile of a European Union."
"To conclude, political discussion about transport policy is interesting, but no less interesting are the opinions of other participants in the debate."
"In the magazine of the Dutch freighters' organisation EVO, the mouthpiece of tens of thousands of small, medium and large businesses, I read the following in a survey of trends within the transport sector, under the heading of ""rail transport' ."
"I quote: ' ' European rail policy finds itself in a crucial phase."
"The freighter can expect little from rail transport over the coming years."
"Politicians should therefore stop going on about the increase in road transport.'"
"They are mere words, but they are words which emerge from the corner which carries the freight, Mr President, and it is this freight which is the subject of this debate."
"From now on we should realize this more than ever."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commission White Paper and the Sarlis report."
"In particular, I support the main objectives with the aim of encouraging the transfer of traffic from road to rail."
"All of us in this House would welcome the environmental benefits that such a transfer could bring."
"Further liberalization of the rail sector is necessary."
"As Mr Simpson has mentioned, we are awaiting the implementation into national law of the Commission directives already adopted."
"In my view, there should be a clear separation between the management of infrastructure and the operation of services to ensure transparency."
"Perhaps the Commission might like to take the UK model in this regard."
"Open access should be extended to all freight and international passenger services."
"It is especially important that we insist that normal state aids criteria should apply in restructuring railway finances."
"It is absolutely vital that there should be no distortion of the market in this regard."
"In supporting the introduction of rail freight freeways, I see this as a first step towards the creation of open access on Member States' rail networks."
"However, it is important that this be accompanied by proposals on financial restructuring and the development of methodology for access charging."
"I commend the Sarlis report to the House and congratulate the Commission on introducing its White Paper."
"Mr President, as the late Tip O'Neill said: ' All politics is local' ."
"I want to address this paper on that basis."
"Ireland's urban transport is in chaos."
"In my own constituency of Dublin, transport congestion must be tackled as a national priority."
"Gridlock is the order of the day."
"With the Irish economy doing so well we cannot stand by and allow transport inefficiencies to become a limiting factor in that growth."
"Hard political decisions must be made now."
"It is time for firm political leadership."
"It is imperative that the work begins on the Dublin light transit system known as Luas before the millennium."
"New structural funds have been allocated to it and will be re-routed away from the project if work does not commence by the year 2000."
"The Luas tribunal must begin as a matter of urgency."
"The light transit system should be part of an integrated transport system."
"It would not succeed without other mainstream transport infrastructure projects such as the major C ring road, the Dublin port tunnel and the upgrading of the main roads out of the city."
"More than 30 % of the traffic into Dublin is in transit and it is time to take a firm political decision to sort out the transport problems once and for all."
"All these systems should be linked to a modern rail network with up-to-date rolling stock."
"Irish Rail needs major investment and modernization."
"In my view, it is unfair to blame the workers for constant breakdowns and delays in the train service."
"The reality is that we have neglected our transport and rail systems at a national level."
"We must ensure that while the economy is buoyant we invest wisely in rail and road networks and in other transport infrastructures."
"It is of the utmost importance that we in Ireland do not get left behind our mainland European neighbours on the economically and socially vital issues of transport."
"Finally, I find it intolerable that in a major capital city like Dublin we still have an inefficient bus service from the airport to the city centre."
"That is part of what is wrong with our transport system."
"Mr President, railways and environmentally-friendly and long-term sustainable means of transport must be one of the most important areas which we as elected representatives can devote ourselves to in the European Parliament, and of course in other parliaments too."
"But we must, as representatives of the peoples of the EU, decide whether we want to concentrate on railways more than on aircraft, motorways and bridges, such as the Öresund bridge in Sweden."
"We must prioritize railway investment."
"But we are not doing that."
"Instead we are treating it as part of all the other means of transport."
"We should prioritize energy-saving, environmentally-friendly, sustainable means of transport."
"That includes railways."
"However, I am not so sure that deregulation is the best way to do that."
"There are other measures which are much better."
"We must also ensure that old railways are improved."
"In addition, we must take into account a number of different factors, such as efficiency, regional considerations, energy aspects, environmental aspects and employment aspects, so that railways become a competitive means of transport in Europe."
"Mr President, the Commission's White Paper is aimed at the immediate liberalization of rail transport, and especially the unlimited access of private businesses to rail networks."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Sarlis, apparently worried about the consequences, is making an admittedly notable attempt to slow the speed down and to raise a number of problems which, in his opinion, call for the gradual promotion of liberalization."
"However, such intense anxieties cannot be confronted in this way."
"When all is said and done, at some point in time there needs to be a rundown of the consequences of total liberalization in all sectors, such as air freight, sea freight, the European ship repair industry, etc.. The citizens of Europe need to realize the repercussions in both the public and the broader service sector, the dramatic deterioration of freight safety and of quality of service."
"They need to be aware of the enormous repercussions on employment, on working conditions and on the social rights of workers."
"If we look at things in this way, then we will realize the dangers involved in liberalization, which is being pushed forward by the Commission, and of course we will assume our own responsibilities and react accordingly."
"Mr President, I argue in favour of an efficient and modern railway system."
"Clearly, there are many ways of achieving this and I am not sure that we are all in agreement with the method proposed in the White Paper."
"Why plead the case for an efficient rail system?"
"Because, in balancing up the different methods of transport, we give an essential priority to rail as opposed to road, for social reasons, for ecological reasons, for reasons of town and country planning, for coherence of transport policies."
"From this perspective, Directive 91/440 establishes what we consider to be a sufficient starting point."
"When, however, a discussion came before the Council to go beyond this Directive, certain governments, including quite clearly the French government, were opposed to this direction."
"This is why the idea has been put forward in a White Paper enabling the question of liberalization to be considered as a whole."
"Unfortunately, not only does the White Paper maintain fully the amendments to Directive 91/440, it goes further."
"It now seems that the White Paper, as it is presented, is not a realistic way to handle the future of the railways."
"How could anyone think that the White Paper will enable the problems of this sector to be solved? The social consequences are vast - we have been reminded of the figures: 500 000 jobs, being one third of all staff, have been lost between 1985 and 1995, and the Commission confirms this tendency for the future, although it suggests no solution, preferring to leave responsibility with individual Member States."
"It seems, however, that recent experience has shown us that to deal with the question of transport from a position of competition and liberalization only, deliberately ignoring the social dimension, may be a serious error."
"In his report, Mr Sarlis does not approve of the White Paper as it stands."
"Rather than an immediate liberalization, he proposes a gradual liberalization."
"This does not seem realistic to us. At least for the moment, all further liberalization should be rejected, given that there has been no evaluation of the results of Directive 91/440 on an objective basis."
"All the possibilities of Directive 91/440 must be explored before it is amended, and cooperation must be encouraged between rail operators."
"This is the reason why, along with a number of my colleagues, I have signed many amendments and we will refuse to vote for certain paragraphs in Mr Sarlis' report."
"Mr President, let me first express my sincere thanks to Mr Sarlis for his careful and comprehensive treatment of the subject matter and for his excellent conclusions, with which I agree."
"I would just like to look at some of these issues in more detail."
"It is regrettable that the Commission has excluded the social question, despite the fact that some 500 000 jobs have already been lost throughout the European rail industry."
"Commission proposals are urgently required to provide assistance in the following areas."
"Firstly, requirements and procedures for the common recognition of contracts and diplomas awarded to railway staff."
"Secondly, retraining of personnel for the new jobs being provided by the new railway companies."
"Thirdly, the general harmonization of working conditions for railway employees; and fourthly, the necessary formal and fundamental qualifications and the guarantee of a professional training scheme for personnel who are taken on by the new railway companies."
"I would further urge the Commission to propose the necessary structural amendments to the operation of the European social fund so that it can deal with the problems arising in respect of unemployment and early retirement in the railway industry, which in many Member States have been the result of restructuring in the rail transport sector."
"I would emphasize that rail transport has a vital role to play in allowing socially disadvantaged citizens, who cannot afford private transport of their own, to assert their right to freedom of mobility."
"Mr President, good though unification and the attempt to revitalize the railways may be, there are nevertheless other alternatives apart from those emphasized by my colleagues, especially in the social sphere."
"Firstly, the rail network is literally facing scandalously unfair competition from trucks."
"What direction is the Commission going in?"
"Will we burden trucks with the cost of motorways or will we deduct from the railways the cost of infrastructure?"
"But then the states will get hold of it and what will become of their deficits?"
"I want a clear direction."
"Or will we place tolls on the railways?"
"Things must be simplified at some point or other."
"Secondly, railways in Europe have problems, administrative for the most part in the west, but also problems of development and integration in the east and, chiefly, the south. I am thinking here of the Balkans, of Greece, etc."
"There, and I repeat, the problem is not so much administrative as the organization and completion of its network. What is the direction of the Commission?"
"Mr President, I am not convinced by the Community support frameworks that I have seen."
"Priority is still given to the car and to motorways, while crumbs are given to the railways."
"Policy needs to be changed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think we know that the social issue should not be ignored. But if we leave the railways as they are, we will lose credibility."
"We need to take into account the degree of difficulty faced by the railways in Europe and in the individual Member States at the moment."
"We need to restore the competitiveness of the railway system, which is possible in the light of the analysis proposed, but naturally we cannot just consider the railway system and railway transportation; we also need to take other means into account, the role this competitiveness can play in trade and in combined transportation and, naturally, how the various means of transport are integrated."
"From this point of view, we cannot isolate the revitalization of the railway system from the other issues being examined by the European Union."
"I am thinking, for example, of the subject that has been rightly raised regarding the internationalization of costs."
"I think that, from this point of view, we need to tackle the subjects of possible incidents, congestion, pollution and noise."
"The methods of transport will become competitive once again if we deal with these aspects as well as the White Paper on Railways, so as to enable the various means of transport to compete fairly."
"In this connection, I therefore think we should not consider this project in isolation, but we should take into account the fact that serious problems exist in Europe."
"I am thinking of the 50 thousand killed in road accidents, the 7, 800 killed in Italy every year - again in road accidents - and the serious problems of atmospheric pollution."
"We also have to face the social issue, otherwise it risks being faced alone, because if the railway system is no longer competitive, we will no longer be able to guarantee jobs for those currently employed on the railways."
"We therefore need to assume this responsibility, and we should do so above all as the left."
"From this point of view, the answer may be more significant."
"Who is going to run the railways?"
"This is a very important point."
"We should ensure that, with competitiveness and competition, access to the railways is not reserved just for the large companies and large groups."
"We should also ensure that access to the management of the railways is democratic, and that it is also possible for small and medium-sized companies, cooperatives and social structures to take part, providing guarantees against social dumping, observing working hours and safety."
"Only in this way can the railway system be revitalized."
"Mr President, thank you very much, can I begin by wishing you and the whole of the House a very happy New Year."
"The Sarlis report before the House today, Mr President, is a truly valuable contribution to the debate about revitalizing the railways of the European Union."
"As both the Commission and Parliament agree, major changes are essential if the railways are to survive as a significant and essential means of transport throughout Europe, as we all want for every sensible economic, employment and environmental reason."
"The report is, as we would have expected from its author, positive and constructive about revitalizing rail transport and while I am glad to say it supports the general policy that the Commission has proposed, it also makes valuable recommendations about how the change should be brought about."
"I therefore warmly congratulate the rapporteur Mr Sarlis for a report that has strengths of strategic vision and practicality."
"I assure him and the House that the proposals which he makes will be given careful and positive consideration."
"I do not think that I oversimplify when I say that there are two basic messages in the report."
"One is that liberalization must be progressive and the other is that accompanying measures to facilitate change must be adopted as that liberalization takes place."
"On the first point, I accept that market forces should be introduced progressively in order to give the railways time to adapt and for the Community to be able to put a comprehensive framework in place."
"There has never been any intention therefore, nor is there any proposition, for what has been described as a 'Big Bang' approach to the liberalization of European rail."
"I also emphasize however, that change cannot be too slow or too gradual, simply because time is not on the side of the railways."
"It has to be said, that if change is not made with a greater sense of urgency than is presently the case, there may be no Big Bang and that the only sound that we will hear is the funeral bell tolling at the demise of the railways."
"This is not even a twenty-year prospect; this is a dozen years ahead unless change is urgently embraced and urgently implemented."
"In the course of some contributions today, which I greatly respect, including the contribution from Mme Berès, it was said that half a million jobs have gone from rail in the last fifteen years."
"That is a tragic truth."
"Part of our strategy, indeed central to the social consciousness of our strategy, is an absolute determination to implement policies that will save at least a substantial part of the million jobs that remain in rail and rail-associated industries over the next dozen years."
"Without change, the casualty list over the next twelve years could be even bigger than it has been over the last fifteen years."
"That is how grim the situation is; that is how urgent the need for change must be."
"Most of us would agree that there is urgency and that change must be introduced in a progressive fashion - not with great drama or with brutality but the direction must be absolutely certain."
"It is imperative therefore that we make an energetic start, for instance by opening up international rail freight as soon as possible, as both Mr Simpson and Mr Baldarelli and Mr Castricum have emphasized, not only today but on many previous occasions."
"The precise timing of the implementation of liberalization will, of course, have to be considered very carefully."
"Once the Commission has produced all its proposals and the Council and the Parliament have begun discussion, that will be the time to decide where transitional periods are needed and which measures should be introduced in parallel."
"Clearly, it is too early to discuss a precise timetable now since we do not know what the eventual opinion of the Council and the Parliament will be in reaction to the Commission's proposal."
"All I would say is that anyone , and I choose my words, who really values the contribution and the potential of rail in Europe, and certainly anyone who wants rail to thrive in the future, will not cause unnecessary delay in introducing the essential advances."
"Mr Sarlis' report rightly stresses that various measures must accompany rail liberalization."
"As he acknowledges, the Commission's approach makes broad provision in this respect and we are now moving forward toward action which will give practical effect to the proposal set out in our White Paper."
"This year therefore I will be presenting three packages of railway measures: the first in the spring will relate to infrastructure and will include proposals for the further separation of infrastructure management and transport operations."
"It will also include proposals relating to guidelines on infrastructure charges and guidelines on the allocation of train paths."
"The second package to be produced in the summer will cover public service contracts in particular."
"It will also cover state aids not only in the rail sector but in land transport generally."
"Then, towards the end of the year, the third package will deal with railway inter-operability and the integration of national systems more generally, including the qualifications of railway staff."
"In addition, in the first half of this year there will be two proposals covering transport as a whole with particular relevance obviously for rail: one relating to the extension of the working time directive to all transport workers and one in the form of a White Paper on infrastructure charges in transport generally."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity of responding to Mr Sarlis' report to inform the House with some pleasure that the first rail freight freeways have opened despite the prophecies of gloom and doom which we have heard repeated from some parts of the House again this afternoon, for reasons I understand but do not necessarily accept."
"It is necessary to travel in hope and with energy because if we adopt any other attitude then we guarantee the demise of rail."
"Of course, there are different models to be pursued in the reform that is now under way in rail and as yet there are no complete and conclusive arrangements, for instance, on pricing."
"No one in this House or elsewhere could have reasonably expected such perfection in these very early days of rail freight freeways."
"The fact that freeways are operational and capable of showing their potential for making rail freight competitive with other modes, despite the inhibitions of tradition and the reservations still held in some quarters, is a tribute to all who have worked for progress."
"It is also a source of encouragement towards further steps in the future."
"Naturally, I agree that the freeways should extend throughout the Community wherever the need exists and links to the ports are important, as has been registered in the course of this debate again today."
"The Commission will continue to stress that, whilst recognising that policy decisions on freeways must be made by the Member States and by infrastructure managers and not by the Commission, whose role is to promote the idea and to help to overcome the difficulties."
"If we were to advocate the degree of centralization that would make responsibility for the allocation of train paths rest in the Breydel building in Brussels, we would be properly inviting a description of our attitudes as absurd."
"We are enablers, we simply strive to ensure that others take full advantage of the changes that we are striving to make."
"To conclude I warmly welcome this report and I am sure that this Parliament will consider the forthcoming proposals in the same positive way as it has the White Paper on revitalization and indeed the communication on rail freight freeways."
"I am grateful for that and that this House shares the determination of the Commission to try to help to create railways that are capable of competing with other modes, of winning back markets and meeting the demands of people and businesses in this modern age."
"If railways succeed in doing all that, they will succeed in giving themselves a full and prosperous future."
"Those working for the railways will share in that future."
"If change is not made along the lines again set out in this report, and indeed in the Commission's White Paper the future is very bleak."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner for the kind words he has addressed to me concerning the report."
"I would just like to add that the report, as presented to the partsession, is the result of the collaborative work of my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who really worked hard on the issue of railways, and took part in meetings and debates, so that we were able to come up with this result."
"I should also add that I am delighted with the Commission's response to the report, and that Parliament recognizes this response, from what I have gathered from the interest shown in the Committee on Transport."
"I have two points that I would like to put to the Commissioner, if you would allow me."
"One is that the amendment to the extending of working hours in all sections of the transport industry is very good news."
"I regard this measure as extremely important. It is a measure that will smooth out the distortion of the competition that exists at the moment between road transport and the railways."
"Finally, I would like to request that careful consideration be given to the issue of guidelines, if they are being contemplated, as regards the work agreements which will be signed by the network administrators."
"There is a delicate issue here: that these work agreements may be judged to contravene article 85 of the Treaty."
"Commissioner, these are two points that I would like you to bear in mind."
"Mr President, it might be that I have missed something, or that we have completely different definitions of what a freight freeway is."
"If we are talking about a rail infrastructure where there is free access and price competition, then, indeed, it might be that there is one freight freeway."
"I do not want the Commissioner, by the way, to sit in the Breydel."
"He should go out and persuade the operators to open up...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, very briefly to Mr Sarlis, I wish to express my gratitude to him for the reference he made to the extension of the working time directive."
"He can look forward to further progress in this respect in the near future."
"So far as guidelines relating to cooperation agreements are concerned, it is quite probable that such formality will not be needed."
"It is enough - heeding a point made by Mr Wijsenbeek - that working in practical conjunction with infrastructure managers, we can secure the progress necessary."
"Naturally, that will be very closely scrutinized."
"If we think further developments could assist the more rapid development of rail freight freeways, we will respond to that urgently."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Operation of aeroplanes"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0404/97), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive amending Directive 92/14/EEC on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988) (C4-0530/97-96/0209(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr van Dam)."
"Mr President, Directive 92/14 prohibits the operation of all Chapter 2 aircraft in the European Union as from 1 April 2002."
"For the noisiest Chapter 2 aircraft, those that are more than 25 years old, and the so-called ""narrow bodies' , this ban entered into effect on 1 April 1995."
"A review of the Directive is not only necessary in order to amend the list of aircraft from developing countries."
"In addition, it appears that Member States interpret the transitional period differently, and that exceptions are abused."
"This abuse entails, amongst other things: subleasing or hiring an aeroplane with an exemption by another airline; the wrongful application of exemptions, which were intended for airlines within the Union in connection with gradual replacement by air carriers in third countries; and granting exemptions to air carriers within the Union."
"The common position deserves positive response on the point of uniform interpretation of the Directive in all Member States."
"In accordance with the amendments adopted by the European Parliament during the first reading of the Van der Waal report, subleasing will be prohibited."
"Granting transitional terms to airlines outside the Union will also be prohibited."
"The United Kingdom will not be required to suspend the licences granted to American companies who provide for gradual replacement."
"Furthermore, granting exemptions to air carriers which are not airlines is prohibited."
"The consequences of the ban on subleasing should not be underestimated."
"It will lead to serious problems for a number of cargo airports within the Union, and for a number of developing countries."
"Reports appeared in the press, for instance, saying that Ostend airport in Belgium is losing 45 000 tonnes, ie. about half of its cargo despatch, because only 11 out of the 43 African aircraft which now fly to Ostend appear on the list of exemptions."
"Moreover, INZET, a Dutch organization for development cooperation, warned that it will become difficult for some African countries to continue to export their products to the Union by plane, because their cargo planes are no longer to be given exemptions."
"In view of the total ban on Chapter 2 aircraft from 1 April 2002 and the serious noise pollution caused by aeroplanes, the rules must under no circumstances be stretched."
"Great care has to be taken to ensure that these rules are complied with uniformly throughout the Union, considering the consequences of stepping up the rules against subleasing."
"My question to the Commission is therefore whether they are prepared to supervise this compliance strictly."
"In this context, I should point out that Ostend is accusing two French airports of trying to attract aircraft which are banned."
"The European Parliament had also proposed in the first reading to give airports the opportunity to restrict access for all Chapter 2 aircraft before the commencement of the total ban on 1 April 2002."
"As a result of rapid growth in aviation, noise space has become the determining factor at some airports."
"This is particularly the case at the Dutch national airport of Schiphol."
"The takeoff or landing of one Chapter 2 aircraft takes up the noise space of five comparable Chapter 3 aircraft."
"In the evening this comparison works out at one to ten."
"The Council did not accept the amendments from the European Parliament on this issue."
"The common position refers to Directive 2408/92."
"In this context, I ask the Commission whether this Directive offers airports the opportunity to refuse entry, not because the airport is physically full, but because the noise space has been used up."
"Does the Commission agree with me that the reference to this regulation 2408/92 is not enough to push back aircraft noise?"
"Are the opportunities for this not limited to issues like a night ban for Chapter 2 aircraft, day and night quotas and higher landing rights?"
"I would love to hear from the Commission whether this does not leave a gap in the rules which makes it more difficult for airports to combat noise pollution."
"On this point of amendment of the annex, the common position deserves sharp criticism."
"It is really unacceptable that the Council and the European Commission wish to place Saudi Arabia on a list of exemptions."
"Council and the Commission refer wrongly to the OECD's list of developing nations."
"In the original Directive 92/14 no reference to this list was made whatsoever."
"If we do want to work with this list, then it offers the opportunity to differentiate between richer and poorer developing nations, as proposed by the European Parliament in the Van der Waal report."
"By placing Saudi Arabia on the list of exemptions, it may get an exemption for nine more of these out-of-date, environmentally harmful aeroplanes in the year 2000."
"The rightful stepping up of the rules to ban subleasing presents problems to African countries, as I have said."
"The fact that Saudi Arabia is allowed to continue flying to the European Union with a large number of equally noisy aircraft is all the more totally contrary to the spirit of Directive 92/14."
"I call on this Parliament to support these amendments, which aim to put an end to this unjust preference."
"Perhaps we can stir Council and the Commission to return from their digressions."
"I would like to thank the members of the transport committee who have supported me unanimously."
"Let us be serious about combatting unnecessary aeroplane noise."
"Mr President, the report proposed is the result of an exhaustive debate in committee, and it seems to me that the further amendments proposed take into account several inconsistencies that have not been accepted by Council."
"I am of course also referring to the Saudi Arabian navy, which is basically classified as a navy of a developing country, something which seems very anachronistic to us."
"In this connection, an amendment is tabled that refers to the OECD classification, and should therefore exclude the Saudi Arabian navy from the benefits resulting from the measure relating to polluting aircraft that do not make a noise and that are more than 25 years old."
"Consequently, from this point of view, a positive requirement would be restored: the motion would essentially relate to those countries actually in difficulties and would guarantee the safety and, naturally, the quality of life of citizens living near the airports."
"One further point, which seems important to me but which has not been raised, is of course competition."
"I would like this point to be made, and not just by the Commission, that landing rights should not be the object of transfer because, naturally, the possibility of having a slot with an authorized aircraft is very important today in competition between the various countries."
"There may also be the risk of this slot being transferred to third countries, and therefore the risk of a real marketing of slots on aircraft that are basically authorized and are polluting and also noisy."
"All this could end up in an incorrect market mechanism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as was the case in the first reading, we now find ourselves caught in an area of tension between efficiency and the environment."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party welcome the current report and the amendments which are being proposed, although we regret that only two of the nine proposals submitted in the first reading are being considered; these two amendments are in my view very important ones."
"They prevent aircraft leasing and therefore have a direct effect on the problem of competition, which has just been mentioned."
"I would also be pleased if the Commission could clarify this point and explain that there is now absolutely no possibility, no matter what the circumstances are, that the exemptions which certain countries have in respect of competition and the environment, can be used in a manner which is contrary to that intended by the Directive."
"In all events, we regret that certain proposals aimed at tightening up this legislation have not been generally adopted."
"In our view, what the Member States propose doing in this sector should on no account fall short of the provisions of the directive, and at best should exceed what is intended in this directive."
"I therefore consider that this cannot be prejudicial to the directive in the strained situation which exists in respect of efficiency, the environment and also free competition."
"The current wording is a reasonable compromise."
"It includes a number of minor corrections."
"However, it would be in everybody's interest if we could in some way clarify the definition of ""developing countries' ."
"What has been submitted in this proposal seems, I believe, already to have met the approval of the Commission."
"I would be pleased if the Commission could briefly comment on this again today."
"It would be a good thing for all of us if the Council could incorporate into this definition the meaning of ""developing countries' , so as to prevent any wider interpretation here."
"After all, we are talking about aeroplanes which are not just a noise nuisance, but which are on the whole more than 25 years old, and in this context I am of the opinion that even a country like Saudi Arabia should not receive special treatment."
"As far as the other countries are concerned, one should not really judge the problem according to the freight situation at the different European airports, but rather one should see to it that perhaps within the framework of various actions - and does this House not also distribute aid for development - certain countries which are directly affected could be provided with support in this area so that European airports, as well as those of the countries concerned, can be afforded some relief from the problem of noise nuisance."
"Mr President, if I could very briefly refer to the background to the particular measure that is before the House today and is the subject of the debate."
"At the time of the adoption of the 1992 directive, a number of aircraft from developing nations had not been notified to the Commission under the appropriate procedure and were therefore not included in the annex to the law, so in order to identify those aircraft the Commission entered into negotiations with the appropriate regional organization - the Arab Air Carriers' Organization."
"The subject matter of these negotiations was of course the technical eligibility of the aircraft on the basis of the criteria laid down in article 3 of the directive, and the designation of countries as developing nations is completely in accordance with criteria laid down by the relevant international organization, the OECD Development Assistance Committee."
"Against that background I would like to respond to the amendments presented by the rapporteur, Mr van Dam and supported by several other Members."
"First, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3 which are useful technical adjustments to the annex."
"The House may also be interested to know that they have the support of the Council too."
"Whilst I completely understand the motivation behind Amendments Nos 1 and 4, I have to say however that the Commission cannot accept them for the very simple reason that Saudi Arabia is included in the official international list of developing nations which was used in drawing up the original annex to Council Directive 92/14."
"In addition, the aircraft included in the annex meet the criteria laid down in Annex 3 of Council Directive 92/14 as amended by this directive."
"If we did want to change the rules, as has been suggested, for reasons that I totally understand, we would, for the sole purpose of this directive, have to compile a new definition of what a developing nation really is, an activity which would be disproportionate to the effort involved, given that in this case we are talking about no more than 7 aircraft."
"Finally, the Commission would like to point out that because of the limited use of the aircraft concerned, the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the list has a very marginal effect in terms of increased noise nuisance around airports, although naturally we regret any impact of that kind."
"I can, of course, understand the motivations which have inspired the amendments relating to the aircraft registered in Saudi Arabia."
"However, I hope that the House will accept that we really cannot renege on agreements previously reached in good faith with partners and we cannot reasonably change internationally recognized definitions when that would affect about half a dozen aircraft which are in any case being phased out of use."
"With those considerations in mind, and whilst thanking Mr van Dam for his very competent report, the first that I think he has formally presented to this House in the short time that he has been here, I hope that the House will, on reflection, come to share the Commission's view."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Industrial competitiveness"
"The next item is the report (A4-0384/97) by Mr Desama, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled: ""The European Union and Space: fostering applications, markets and industrial competitiveness' (COM(96)0617 - C4-0042/97)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is a very unusual sitting today."
"Having talked about the inherent problems of the railways, and air transport, we are now looking at European space policy."
"In spite of this brilliant ascent, I fear that given our current knowledge of space physics, we will soon be obliged to come back down to earth."
"I will do my best to give a rapid outline of the space report."
"First of all, we must remember that Europe is not an amateur in the area of space conquest."
"Indeed, over the years we have managed to maintain our autonomy and our independence regarding space access, and this has been largely due to two efforts: firstly, intergovernmental cooperation thanks to the European Space Agency, and secondly a policy of willing public investment on the part of a certain number of European states."
"But in spite of these efforts, and this independent access, it has to be noted that compared with the United States, we are the space dwarf."
"The space industry employs 200 000 people in the United States, as opposed to around 40 000 in Europe; 7 % of the financing of space policy in the United States is covered by private investment and commercial interests, as opposed to 38 % in Europe."
"In other words we have a great deal of readjusting to do."
"It is not necessarily a question of putting a tiger in your tank, but rather of adding something to European policy, of adding a little community policy, even supranational policy, to the intergovernmental in order to avoid raising up a number of old demons."
"The European Union now needs its own space policy, not only in relation to others, but to bring that European added value to European space cooperation policies as a whole."
"Of course, it will not be Parliament that defines this policy, but the Commission, who have made the first step through this interesting communication, and the Council."
"We would like to see a European Council devoted entirely to the issue of space."
"The British Presidency will perhaps hear my plea."
"This policy, this European added value must, it seems to me, be based on two fundamental conditions."
"The first condition is that all the issues must be considered, both strategic and commercial. This means admitting, once and for all, that a space policy is necessarily a global policy, that there is not, on the one hand, a strategic policy and on the other, a commercial policy, but that the efforts as a whole must cover all the issues of this space policy."
"The second condition is that the Member States and the European Union must devote more public funds to the establishment and development of space policy."
"For although private investment is essential, it is not enough."
"By respecting these conditions and gaining inspiration from the excellent report of my colleague, Mr Malerba, we will have placed a certain number of milestones along the path of space policy."
"Firstly, the maintenance of a high level of technological competence through an instrument such as the Fifth Framework Programme, but also through our participation in a number of great scientific adventures, such as the space station, for example, and many more."
"Secondly, the concentration of the space industry."
"This does not mean setting up one great big European space business - an elephant will never run as fast as a zebra - but to federate all of the organizations which, today, devote themselves to pathetic competition on a world scale, into integrated projects: the conquest of a number of large commercial markets, and the provision of a good service."
"Thirdly, the consolidation of our strong points, the launcher and satellite business."
"Fourthly, the guaranteeing of our means of independence, in particular by putting in place a European navigation system which would be the fruit of European technology. And, finally, the organizing of cooperation with third countries, not only with the long-standing space powers like Japan or Russia, but with the newly emerging space powers."
"I am thinking in particular of China and India."
"Finally, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the need to develop the means for space education."
"If we want to follow an ambitious policy, we need the support of public opinion."
"But the public needs to be informed, and education is the best way of doing this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this discussion in this House has come rather late with regard to the Commission's communication times and, in some ways, the reports being discussed now (Mr Desama's excellent report and my own) are beginning to be almost overtaken by events."
"There have been moments of great interest in recent months, such as the Mars Pathfinder voyage, the successful launch of ARIANE 5 and, now, that of Lunar Prospector."
"On the wings of the Pathfinder success, noting the success of the planetary exploration and the enigma of life in the universe in American public opinion, NASA is now planning to use the space station as an outpost for the manned flight to Mars as well, and is considering an inflatable module that will be attached to the space station, called a trans-hub."
"Space is the place of innovation and creative imagination par excellence."
"One example is satellite navigation."
"Ten years ago, we did not know what it was."
"Today, this application ensures safety in air navigation, offers solutions for the efficiency of taxi fleets in cities, and we are asking for a European satellite navigation system."
"In this sea and space of the next millennium, the leading characters are the United States, as stated by Mr Desama, and their world leadership in the economic, military, technological and cultural sector is also shown in their scientific and industrial dynamism in the space sector."
"It is not easy to draw a comparison between the American and European space sectors: the United States' annual investment is around four times that of Europe, and the largest European industrial firm in the sector comes after the three American giants, Lockheed, Hughes and Boeing."
"The Commission's communication does not delve into the problems of a real European space strategy and proposes a series of specific measures which can broadly be divided into three sectors in which space applications are opening up new markets with a high economic and strategic value: multimedia telecommunications, satellite navigation and observation of the Earth."
"These trends are largely shared by the European Parliament and have also been the object of a communication on telecommunication satellites, for which Mr Hoppenstedt was the rapporteur, and are to an extent also included in the Fifth Framework Programme."
"Here, however, I should point out that, following the revisions to the many amendments to the report, always with tight deadlines, we have ended up by consolidating most of the space research subjects into an aeronautical and astronautical action rather than into the various sections such as transport, environment and information society, general materials technologies, and I think this consolidation should possibly be reconsidered when we get to the second reading, maintaining the assignment to the various sections."
"Many political and strategic questions remain to be answered and I would like to dwell on these for a moment."
"Over the last three years, the American companies have merged into just three groups of worldwide dimensions, while the European consolidation process is slow."
"Do the national space agencies still have a role to play in the future?"
"And what about the European Space Agency?"
"And the role of the Commission?"
"My reasoning leads me to see the Commission assuming a more purposeful role in the near future with regard to space strategies, towards the Council and Parliament, and even internationally to take part in negotiations for frequency allocations and satellite positions."
"I have suggested in my report that the Commission ask for a European Council on ""space' , at least to sound it out."
"We are waiting to discuss these subjects again in Parliament and we are waiting for a communication on navigation systems, while the Intergroup on space travel and the space-travel Task Force are continuing to increase contacts with the Commission, the ESA and industry."
"This chapter has really only just begun!"
"Mr President, firstly, may I congratulate the rapporteur."
"He has shown his usual willingness to incorporate the ideas of colleagues, which is appreciated."
"We appreciate too the expert views of Mr Malerba."
"This report emphasizes the importance of space, the need for support from public funds - commercial interests will be totally inadequate - and the real added value that comes from European Union work."
"He contrasts the position in the United States and the European Union in terms of jobs, spin-offs and the development of a scientific culture."
"We are not talking about military research and development."
"That point is quite clearly made."
"Principally we are concerned with satellite applications."
"We are not recommending any encroachment on the role of ESA."
"We talk about telecoms, navigation and Earth observation."
"This is of tremendous value to European Union citizens and beyond that to the third world."
"Mr Desama quotes regional planning, agriculture, fisheries, transport, combatting fraud and the symptoms and difficulties related to climate change."
"I share his view that the space industry must 'boldly go along the path towards a concentration which will enable it to compete with American manufacturers.'"
"I like the reference to Star Trek in the 'boldly go' ."
"Although there is an emphasis on satellites, we need to realize there are tremendous synergies with manned or, more politically correct, peopled activities, which is essential."
"We have to tackle the problem of space debris."
"There are all sorts of things going round in space from space vehicles to hardware to power tools to teapots."
"This is going to become a big problem and must be addressed."
"On the question which some of the amendments raise about the problems of plutonium, we must do research into solar cells."
"They will help us here on earth with energy and there will be spin-offs."
"But it is not yet possible to abandon the use of nuclear power for the generation necessary for some of the instruments in deep space."
"Like my colleagues I would like to emphasize the role for space education."
"Please, everybody, go to Toulouse and see Space City. It will inspire you."
"And of all the sciences which inspire young people, space is paramount."
"It is one which has driven people in the past into physics, and it is very serious if we have a diminution in the number of people studying that subject."
"It is fascinating to all humans and it could be the key to the survival of our planet."
"I very strongly support the strategy outlined in both the Desama report and the Malerba opinion, in particular the need for the Council to take on board the need for a Council meeting devoted to space in the European context."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of real importance that the European Parliament is discussing aviation and space travel here this evening, since this is without doubt a European issue."
"I myself come from a region which has always played an important role in the aviation and space industry and where today everyone recognizes that only through European cooperation will we be able to maintain our competitive position vis--vis the United States, or at least have a chance of recovering it."
"On behalf of them, and also speaking for my own group here, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his comprehensive report."
"I believe that all aspects of the problem have been examined here in an appropriate manner."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party will also lend our full support to this report."
"We have deliberately refrained from submitting any amendments because we do not want to jeopardize the resolution which was adopted by majority vote in committee."
"I do not wish at this point to go over again all the major problems facing the aviation and space industries. Mr Malerba, Mr Desama, as rapporteur, and also Mrs McNally have all addressed the problem in a very articulate way."
"However, at this juncture I should like to refer to another matter, namely the need to achieve full equality of opportunity, particularly with the United States, in the growth markets of aviation and space travel."
"It is not right that the USA should be basically funding research and development through its defence budget, thereby giving it an advantage over the European aviation and space industries."
"Parliament has already dealt with this matter in connection with another report drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"I myself have proposed various amendments in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"While these proposals were unfortunately rejected, this is still a subject which merits our attention."
"It is unacceptable that we in Europe - and indeed this is the basis of a communication from Directorate-General XII - should have no standard procurement system, while the United States obviously combines its research, development and procurement activities and ensures that many developments from the military sector are adopted by the civilian industries, a fact which gives that country clear advantages over the European aviation and space industry."
"We must have no delusions in this respect."
"We have to find a European answer to this challenge."
"I hope that with the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty and the development of a common foreign and security policy we will be able to find a European solution to this problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party I would like to congratulate Mr Desama on his excellent report."
"The European space market is fragmented."
"Many small companies are actively involved, but they do not cooperate sufficiently."
"The restructuring of the space industry - that is, the integration of several companies into one company or grouping - is needed in order to be able to compete in the global market."
"European and transatlantic cooperation in space activities is an absolute must."
"The Fifth Framework Programme could play a encouraging role in this, especially now the cooperation agreement in the sphere of science and technology has been signed with the Americans during the most recent summit in Washington."
"My second point concerns the position of the European satellite industry."
"The strategic importance of our own satellite industry has been of commercial interest since the end of the cold war."
"The sector has been growing by 10 % each year, and contributes to the creation of jobs."
"If the European Union does not want to miss the boat, the Commission and the Member States need to promote the competitiveness of this industry."
"My group is not really thinking of sector-specific support, but of stimulating joint research and cooperation."
"Satellite systems are the way to break into the globalization of the information society."
"But in Europe, investments are primarily made in regional terrestrial networks."
"What is more, the European satellite industry works too much in isolation, without much interaction with the industries which produce computers, networks, software and peripherals."
"As a result of this, the satellite industry is losing an increasing market share to the United States."
"More cooperation and merging between companies, and political support for technological development, are necessary, as well as tackling risk management."
"Mr President, we in the Green Group in the European Parliament have felt obliged to put forward five amendments to this report by Mr Desama in order to clarify, and in some paragraphs also to strengthen, certain points of principle as far as the European Union and space are concerned."
"Firstly, is Mr Desama not using the wrong word when in sentence b of the preamble he says we shall 'conquer' space?"
"To my ears the word conquer has the wrong associations."
"It should be about us exploring what space has to give and nothing else."
"The word conquer is used for ideas in a military context, that something shall be conquered ."
"But that is not what this is about, it is about us exploring, because that should be the idea of the EU's space policy."
"Secondly, as far as large international cooperation projects in space are concerned, on the question of the Casini space project and its 'sweep' past the earth, we think the European Parliament should call on the ESA and NASA to cancel this planned 'sweep' past the earth for safety reasons, since the probe is in fact equipped with 32 kg of highly radioactive plutonium. Several reports from Parliament in the past have said that this is dangerous on safety grounds."
"This probe is going to pass the earth at a distance of 500 miles and at a speed of 68 000 km/h."
"I think we in the European Parliament should prevent that."
"Thirdly, in paragraph 10, as well as saying that we should not use the space programme for military research, it should be added that we should also not use nuclear material in space."
"Fourthly, we must do much more research on solar energy than we have done so far."
"This is something on which the ESA has come a long way, and we could go further in this research."
"Mr President, Mr Desama's report largely covers the field of scientific, ethnological and financial problems by usefully - in terms of our own education - emphasizing not only the communication from the Commission, which is the least important, but also the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament between 1979 and 1994."
"The density of this report is an advantage because it enables us to focus our comments."
"Allow me first of all to state two preconditions."
"The first is that there still seems to be a strong temptation to compare European space policy with that of the United States, in particular by comparing public commitments and by noting the private sector's contribution."
"Perhaps we should remember that the United States is one single state, albeit federal, and that the European Union is made up of fifteen countries, with all the cultural differences that this entails, as well as differences in terms of representative role and weight in science and technology, in research and development relations, and in priorities."
"The second observation is that it seems difficult to separate the components of a dynamic discourse which specifies spheres of cooperation and spheres of competition - in terms of healthy competitiveness - as well as policies of partnership, in particular with the United States but also with Russia, on the question, for example, of very heavy launchers, or with emerging countries such as India, China or Brazil."
"That said, I would like to mention the need to strengthen the social dimension of European space policy."
"We know that the technological orientations are not neutral."
"The current debate relating to manned flights is not simply a debate on the question of whether, on the one hand, we should choose a combination of robots and humans or, on the other, the ""fully automatic' . It is also relates to the problem of the outlook we are giving to society for the coming decades."
"The question of application is therefore essential, and the question of social utility crucial in itself."
"If we make progress in earth observation it is to improve our awareness of the balances in the ecosystem and of the need to conserve them."
"If telecommunications develop, it is primarily in order to combat isolation and to make progress in the area of distance medicine."
"If remote sensing expands, it will be because it is a tool for town and country planning."
"Finally, if navigation develops, it will be because the oceans are a favoured place for geostrategic issues."
"A former head of division at the European Space Agency reminded us that there is a one to fifteen ratio between, on the one hand, the market for satellite launchers and on the other, land-based facilities and employment."
"For my part, I see that in Guyana and in Kourou, all along the road, there are billboards proclaiming, ""Kourou, European space terminal' ."
"I can assure you that the one to fifteen ratio is not born out by the facts, nor by the land-based facilities, nor by employment."
"It is probably not the case for other space bases either."
"I think we must look for an integrated programme."
"The social conditions in our countries demand it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Desama's report illustrates the different approach to space travel on either side of the Atlantic."
"The number of employees in this sector alone - 200 000 in the USA as compared with about 40 000 in Europe - tells its own story."
"The growth of the commercial sector in Europe is certainly impressive."
"But technological advance and the development of new activities in the field of space research will certainly not be financed by the commercial sector."
"We can be absolutely sure of that."
"I support the idea that European space policy should be regarded in its entirety, something which is advocated in the report."
"I wish to emphasize that science and the technology of manned space travel are of vital importance, and we should not merely restrict ourselves to their commercial applications."
"It is therefore essential that the Fifth Framework Programme should focus on the funding of space research for the benefit of the information society, earth observation and navigation."
"The British or Austrian Presidency could demonstrate its receptiveness to the technological development of Europe by convening a separate meeting of the European Council, in addition to that of the ESA-Council of Ministers, in order to discuss the theme of a European space policy, as recommended by the rapporteur."
"The urgent need for European industry to improve its competitiveness makes space policy a compulsory subject for the European Council."
"Earth observation is particularly important in this respect."
"When employed in a responsible manner, this activity will stand our citizens in good stead."
"It is a science which guarantees progress in many areas, including environmental research."
"The need for intensive public funding is therefore obvious."
"It would be foolish to think that earth observation will sooner or later be nothing more than a commercial operation."
"Here Europe is on the point of losing out to the United States."
"The European Union must therefore not slacken its pace but must rather make earth observation a key part of its space research policy and to this effect should devise and submit a well thought out action programme."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start my comments on Mr Desama's report on Europe and space by thanking and congratulating him for the enormous amount of work he has put into this within the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"Along with some of our colleagues, in spite of certain lobbies, fashions and, above all, caution, he defends the industrial and technological interests of Europe, its research and its appropriations, not to mention the safety of our energy."
"As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I very often come into contact with these issues during the writing of my own reports and during my own work."
"I am, furthermore, working at this moment on industrial competitiveness in Europe, and I know the importance of public appropriations for research and the importance of space in our operations, our strengths and our European industrial hopes."
"As a European, as a socialist and as a Frenchman, I therefore unreservedly support all of Mr Desama's proposals."
"Firstly, on the need for the revival of investment; on the delays and the catching up needed in some areas; on the need for concentration of the industry; on the place of the Fifth Framework Programme for research in its operations; and on the strengthening of our technological and economic potential in order to improve the technological competence and the financial capacity of the space industry, both military and civil."
"I also obviously support his requests for the utilization of the space industry in the protection of man against natural disasters and other major risks."
"Finally, like him, I am aware of the actions necessary to control and eliminate the pollution caused by space debris."
"Yes, Madam President, I will say once again that it is a good report, and very important for Europe."
"Let us hope the proposals will be voted for, taken up and followed through."
"I would like to finish as I started, by insisting that European public financing of this sector must not be reduced."
"Do not forget that the Chinese launchers are largely financed by the Chinese State."
"Without going that far, we must avoid distortions caused by competition and therefore the European Union must not withdraw."
"Simply put, it is better to concentrate our efforts, better to target our objectives and not miss the small firing window in front of us."
"Let us never forget - I am finishing, Madam President - that if the European space industry is flourishing commercially today, it is because, in its time, there has been some true political and public will, particularly in France."
"This will, and these appropriations, remain just as necessary today in order to prepare the space industry for tomorrow."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Christian Democrat and member of the Group of the European People's Party I naturally welcome the report which has been presented by Mr Desama and Mr Malerba because like my colleague Mr Ferber I too perceive that it contains elements from our contributions in committee."
"Of course, I also welcome the excellent collaboration which has taken place with the Commission, in this case with Mrs Cresson, Mr Bangemann and Mr Kinnock, on the subject of guidance systems"
"I believe that the small interest groups to be found in this House - here in this Chamber, in the Intergroup on space travel and also in the space-travel Task Force, which has been formed from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy - will develop into a major movement, and that the fascination which emanates from space travel will, I hope, attract greater attention both within this House and indeed from the wider public outside."
"On the way home this evening you have only to gaze at the clear, starry night sky and at the wondrous full moon to be convinced of the fascination of our universe."
"Unfortunately we are meeting here in a windowless room and cannot appreciate the magnificence of it all."
"I do not want to repeat what has already been said."
"It has all been said already."
"I believe that the most important issue for the future - to be dealt with in the next report, which has already been submitted (and of which I am the rapporteur) - namely the position of the European aviation and space industries, will provide us with answers to the global challenges we have to meet."
"How big should our factories be? What should we be manufacturing in them?"
"What sort of businesses do we need as Europeans in order to remain competitive in the global marketplace?"
"I think we should point out clearly that in future the development of guidance systems and aircraft navigation systems, which have already been touched on, and the work of successor organizations to GLONASS and GPS, will constitute a valuable contribution from the European Commission."
"We eagerly await an action plan which will allow us to make a start on these projects this very year."
"Let me close with the following remarks."
"Mention has been made of the problem of space debris."
"In this context, we really should find a European scrap materials company capable of dealing with the problem of orbiting scrap, and we should also raise a warning finger to the various attempts being made by a number of people to have their own ashes scattered on the moon."
"Moon-dust is strange enough on its own without being further altered by the addition of the cremated remains of human beings."
"I do not want to see our moon becoming the favourite stamping ground of Mr Malerba."
"I really believe that this particular subject merits our attention."
"Madam President, the UN is now taking ten years doing research into natural disasters partly with the aim of developing satellite charting applications for the prediction, charting, and avoidance of natural disasters, and to aid relief and rescue operations. It is appropriate now to declare EU support for this work."
"As Mr Desama stresses, the space programme must be seen in its entirety. It involves scientific and technological considerations and civil and military applications."
"However, I do not believe we should support civil and military notions of inhabited space, as manned flights are tremendously expensive, and are not any more important for Europe than unmanned flights equipped with robots and automated equipment."
"The concept of living in space is, besides, a long way off, as we are only now starting to prepare for the first international space station."
"It will presumably only come together in the first half of the next millennium, and the possibility of building stations on other planets is still a very distant one."
"It is especially important for the small European countries that satellites are not too large."
"The risks of big, long-term projects are also very great, and the results only begin to show after many years."
"It would be better to put more money into smaller carrier rockets - booster systems - and small-scale satellites."
"Every European country would be able to contribute to projects like these."
"Furthermore, with small booster systems we will get reasonable results in the shorter term, and money will not be spent on mere scientific exploits."
"The role of the Fifth Framework Programme for research funding is important and necessary."
"The framework programme must be granted appropriations for space research, for example by evolving operations that are connected with the information society and remote surveying."
"Madam President, my Commission colleagues and I welcome the excellent report by Professor Desama and Mr Malerba on our 1996 Communication on a European Union policy for fostering applications, markets and competitiveness for our space industries."
"The report properly reflects the sustained interest which this Parliament has taken in space policy issues over the last 19 years."
"Some would argue that it is a pity that there has not been such widespread and determined commitment from other quarters over that period."
"The report also has the virtue of asserting the importance of an effective European role in the variety of activities that are needed to ensure, in the words of paragraph 6 of the report, that our Community and industries can 'boldly go' towards development which is commensurate with modern needs and opportunities."
"That, very obviously, is in our economic, industrial and security interests, and as several Members of this House have pointed out in the course of this very good debate, it will also help to improve the quality of life of people everywhere in a very great variety of ways."
"As our Communication and this report made clear, responding to the challenges of developments in space policy will require leadership and vision, and everyone involved in national governments, industry, research and in the European institutions needs to be imbued with a sense of urgency."
"The difference in the scale of activity in Europe and the USA is illustrated by the fact that just 39 000 people are employed in space-related activities in the Union - a fifth of the number currently employed in similar activities in the United States of America."
"The fact that in satellite navigation alone there are reliable estimates of a global market that will be worth US$50 billion within the next seven years should inspire an avid desire to exploit the possibilities of growth."
"Clearly, space issues involve a very wide variety of interests and institutions, and the role of the Union and the Commission is not to substitute for these different interests but to help to provide a vision around which they can organize and combine efforts."
"To that end we will continue to use regulation and legislation."
"We will exploit external relations activities to promote European interests bilaterally and in international bodies, a dimension which, as Professor Desama has made clear, is obviously crucial since these markets are, by definition, global and not European, and we need common standards."
"We will further employ research and development resources in the framework programmes and in the telecoms trans-European networks and, of course, we will provide the modest support that is available for infrastructure development through the trans-European networks' budget."
"As the House will know, the primary contributor to space research and development is the European Space Agency, whose annual budget for this specific area is equivalent to that of the whole of the European Union's framework programme."
"Community research and development work in this area therefore needs to be closely targeted on Community priorities, and it needs to be complementary to the activities of the ESA and of Member States."
"Together with my colleagues Edith Cresson and Martin Bangemann, I am therefore committed to ensuring that the Fifth Framework Programme will focus on supporting activities in the three main areas dealt with in the Commission's Communication and, indeed, focused on in the report being considered by the House tonight: satellite communication, navigation and Earth observation."
"One of the key points in the report now being considered is that the private sector should not be expected to substitute for public money in the development of major space-related technologies."
"I strongly share the view that there must be a continuing and substantial public investment in those areas that reflects their strategic importance to society as a whole."
"It is also clear, however, that, as in many other cases, there is a need for imaginative forms of public/private partnership, partly to mobilize complementary sources of financing and partly to improve the quality and the costeffectiveness of projects by bringing in private-sector expertise."
"Meanwhile the action plans which the Commission Communication promised on each of the three main policy areas are under way."
"Indeed, as honourable Members will know, and as Professor Desama said, the one on telecommunications is already available, the Earth observation plan will be available later this year and I am happy to say that the satellite navigation action plan, for which I have responsibility, will be produced later this month."
"That document has two main aims: the aim of catalysing a firm political commitment from Member States for a European contribution to satellite navigation so that the private sector can have the confidence to invest in the future, and, secondly, the aim of demonstrating that the European Union is in a position to take the action necessary to turn vision into reality and make secure practical progress - not a moment too soon, several honourable Members could justifiably add."
"As many honourable Members here will be aware, there are several sensitive areas to deal with, including financing, the question of how the European contribution should relate to the existing United States' and Russian military base systems, and what forms of organization we need in order to run and to regulate the European component of satellite navigation."
"I look forward to discussing that action plan in this Parliament, especially in view of the support given to a European approach to satellite navigation in Professor Desama's report."
"The Commission fully shares this Parliament's commitment to an active and comprehensive European policy for space, with the European Union and its institutions promoting a forward-looking European perspective and cooperating with Member States and other institutions to make a reality of the vision which is increasingly shared."
"I thank this Parliament for its continuing efforts to stimulate and to guide that vision and I express the gratitude of the Commission and particularly my colleagues, Mrs Cresson and Mr Bangemann, for the quality of this report, and my gratitude to those who have compiled it."
"Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"New Rule 79a of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0006/98) by Mr Fayot, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on inserting a new Rule 79a on the procedure for delivering opinions pursuant to Article 109j of the EC Treaty."
"Madam President, I am raising a preliminary question to this debate, in accordance with Rule 128 of our Rules of Procedure."
"In fact, the proposal for a decision in the report and the amendments of the Rules of Procedure included are inadmissible, both for reasons of procedure and for reasons of substance."
"On the level of procedure, the text proposed to the House is not in keeping with the text adopted in committee."
"In fact, the text we had adopted in committee reads as follows, at the end of Paragraph 2: ""Parliament will then vote on the recommendations, with no amendments; there will be a single collective vote for this proposal' ."
"The text submitted to us today is, ""Parliament will then vote en bloc on the recommendations, with no amendments' ."
"Thus this totally different text is, moreover, an amendment - Amendment No 11 - which had been removed by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure as it was an oral amendment."
"Article 150 has therefore not been respected."
"On the substance, the proposed text takes up once again the current drafting of Article 80, Paragraph 1, of the Rules of Procedure, which provides for an assent but not for a consultation of Parliament, whereas Article 109j of the Treaty provides for a parliamentary consultation and not for an assent."
"That is why I am raising this preliminary question."
"Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"The rapporteur, Mr Fayot, will now speak against the motion."
"Madam President, I request the rejection of this preliminary question for two reasons."
"The first concerns the text proposed to the House."
"According to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, it is not the same as that voted for by the Committee."
"In effect, the Committee voted for the addition by saying that Parliament would vote en bloc and it was clearly stated, at the time of discussion and decision by the Committee, that this addition should be integrated into the text."
"This is therefore exactly what has been done."
"As regards the second argument, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy says that it is a question here of an assent text, but the Committee on the Rules of Procedure was not of this opinion."
"This discussion has already taken place in committee; that is why the text presented to you corresponds perfectly, in spirit and in letter, to that which was voted for by the great majority of members of the Committee."
"I therefore ask the House to reject this preliminary question."
"(Parliament decided against referral back to committee)"
"Madam President, Article 109j of the Treaty defines the procedure by which a decision will be made on the countries to participate in monetary union."
"It will be enforced on 1 and 2 May 1998."
"Given the importance of the political issue, it is essential that the institutions involved in this procedure act with the utmost clarity possible."
"The solidity of monetary union, along with its credibility in the eyes of the financial markets and the public, depends upon the transparency and rigour with which key decisions are made."
"The European Parliament will have a role to play in this procedure."
"The Treaty foresees, in Article 109j, Paragraph 2, last subparagraph, and I quote: ""The European Parliament is consulted and conveys its opinion to the Council, which will meet at the level of Heads of State and of Government' ."
"It is not for me to comment here on the quite specific nature of the whole of the procedure."
"But I would like to underline that Parliament intervenes on two occasions and that, in my opinion, this double intervention constitutes a whole, from a political point of view."
"The first intervention takes place when Parliament expresses its opinion on the reports of the Commission and the European Monetary Institute, which will be ready on 24 March 1998."
"This first intervention is ""good policy' , since Parliament, through public debate on respect for convergence criteria and on the whole of the monetary situation, gives a guarantee of democracy to the process."
"On this subject, there is an agreement between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament."
"This first stage enables Parliament to establish a detailed report in which normal parliamentary rules will play a full role."
"There will probably be a vote on the conclusions on 30 April, or even earlier, but in any case sufficiently close to the weekend of 1 and 2 May 1998 to be available for the Ecofin Council on 1 May."
"If this first intervention on the part of Parliament is not anticipated in the Treaty, then the second, on the contrary, most clearly is, as I emphasized at the start."
"It is, in fact, obligatory and it must therefore take place according to a procedure that must be marred by no uncertainty, due to the risk of invalidating the whole of the process towards monetary union."
"It must, furthermore, take place within time constraints the like of which apply to no procedure currently anticipated in our Rules of Procedure."
"It has therefore been necessary to improvise, and amend the Rules of Procedure by introducing a new procedure."
"These constraints are not born of our imagination, but they have been imposed on us as a precondition that cannot be ignored, following the exchange of letters between the President of Parliament, duly mandated by the Conference of Presidents, and the Presidents of the Council and the Commission."
"They are the result of a political will to sort everything out during the weekend in question, whilst the financial markets are shut from the Thursday evening to the Monday morning."
"For the success of the operation, it is an essential condition."
"In this way, Parliament will not have access to the recommendations of the Ecofin Council until the morning of 2 May."
"Given that the European Council is being held that afternoon, it is physically not possible to use the procedure of a written report with amendments."
"The vast majority of the Committee therefore opted for an oral procedure, without amendment, with a block vote on the list of countries to take part in monetary union."
"The text adopted is absolutely clear and unequivocal and is not open to any debate on procedure."
"I am therefore convinced, Madam President, that the text we are proposing to Parliament is in complete accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of our Parliament to bring this extraordinarily complex and important task of completing monetary union to a successful conclusion."
"Madam President, the deadline for submitting amendments has been extended until this evening, even if the political groups had at their disposal, and I wish to emphasize this, the text of the amendment last Tuesday afternoon, after the vote of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure that same afternoon."
"I was told, at 7 p.m. this evening, that only one amendment had been introduced."
"This amendment is an amendment by the Green Group requesting, instead of a block vote, a separate vote on each country on the proposed list of monetary union participants."
"As rapporteur I must oppose this amendment because Parliament cannot, at this stage, start giving out individual marks to countries agreed by the Ecofin Council."
"I think that if Parliament wishes to do so, it can do this during the first stage but, once at this stage of the procedure, to want to comment separately on one country or another would only confuse the political message we have to give."
"Madam President, I request that the House kindly approves the text as proposed by the vast majority of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, and I would like to end by highlighting the excellent collaboration of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure with the Legal Service, but above all with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The Conference of Presidents had asked us to deal with this amendment of the Rules of Procedure together with this Committee."
"I would like to thank in particular the chair of this Committee, Mr von Wogau, and also Mrs Randzio-Plath, chair of the Monetary Sub-Committee, for their very interesting contributions."
"Once again, I ask that the House kindly approves in its majority this amendment to the rules."
"Madam President, I will be brief. I congratulate Mr Fayot on his report."
"The Socialist Group, of whom I am the spokesman, will be supporting it in its entirety and without amendment."
"It was necessary to amend our rules to incorporate our ability to be consulted, swiftly and speedily, on opinions pursuant to article 109j with respect to economic and monetary union."
"Mr Fayot's report is a mean, lean and green report. It is short, sharp and to the point."
"Parliament will debate on the basis of an oral report by its responsible committee."
"It will then take a single collective vote on the recommendations with no amendments."
"This will enable Parliament to speak with a sharp, clear voice and at the same time frustrate those prepared to use all means possible to hinder Europe's forward march."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying that speaking for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as well as for the PPE I both welcome and support the rapporteur's report."
"Within the Group of the European People's Party and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs there is a large majority in favour of the Fayot report and I would like to express my own personal thanks for the cooperation shown by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"Why do we need to amend our Rules of Procedure?"
"Because, for one thing, the process we use to make this resolution is of enormous importance, and, for another, we are going to be in a situation which is relatively new to us."
"What does the Treaty stipulate?"
"It stipulates that the European Parliament is to make known its position on the Finance Ministers' proposal."
"However, this proposal will not be drawn up until the evening of 1 May."
"As a result of this, a written procedure will not be possible and we shall be obliged to state our position to the Finance Ministers' proposal at this special sitting of the European Parliament on 2 May, which will presumably take up the whole morning."
"For this reason, we have opted for a two-part procedure."
"On 25 March, the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission will submit their recommendations."
"On this basis, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will then draw up a report giving all the possibilities for the submission of amendments in committee."
"The European Parliament will subsequently adopt an initial position at its part-session of 29-30 April."
"As Mr Fayot has already said, this position is not expressly provided for in the Treaty, yet neither is it expressly ruled out."
"At the same time, the national parliaments of the various Member States will also be adopting a position on the proposals of the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute."
"When these possibilities have been exhausted and Parliament's position has been made clear, we shall examine the proposal of the Finance Ministers and make our position on it known by verbal process."
"In view of the fact that we previously had a period of one month in which to prepare our position by a truly democratic procedure, I consider it entirely justified that we should concentrate on voting either ""Yes' or ""No' to the Finance Ministers' proposals."
"This is a process which on the one hand will satisfy all the democratic requirements, and on the other will also ensure that the European Parliament properly discharges its duty in this historic situation."
"Madam President, I cannot be as enthusiastic as the previous speakers."
"My group will of course support the report, but we have to ask ourselves if we as Parliament are not giving away a little bit too much by saying that this is right."
"We are having a first debate on the basis of a report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, but as Parliament, we will then still have an important vote on Saturday 2 May."
"It is a special article for a special occasion, because I cannot see us using it much thereafter."
"We can ask ourselves what will be the use of this Parliament's recommendations, and we may assume that the Council will take note of these."
"But must we really restrict ourselves by saying we will vote for or against, and we will not be able to make any amendments?"
"I find this all the more regrettable, because we can only work with oral recommendation in the present version of the Fayot report."
"I would prefer to have seen this oral recommendation as optional."
"We will also consider whether we will have a separate vote on this."
"We know that one Member States meets all the criteria for membership of EMU, did not enter a condition in the Accession Treaty, but yet does not want to participate. Formally we should really say that this invalidates the Ecofin Council recommendation, as this country will not be included."
"We will nonetheless be in favour of starting EMU, but are not able include the qualifications that this country should actually belong. I regret this."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the weak position of Parliament within the legislature is the main flaw in the EU's democratic structure."
"This deficiency also lies at the heart of a further problem, namely the failure of our citizens fully to accept European integration."
"In view of this deplorable situation it must seem absolutely incomprehensible that Parliament of its own accord should opt for a further curtailment of its rights."
"Here I am in no way underestimating the urgency of the situation, and the special circumstances which mean that Parliament very quickly has to adopt a position on the recommendations of the Ecofin Council."
"However, it is quite unjustified that we should forgo a written report on this matter and spontaneously remove the fundamental right of the Members of this House to submit amendments in plenary session, as well as having to vote en bloc ."
"This is tantamount to Parliament cutting its own throat."
"It seems to me to be very important that Parliament is able to adopt a discriminating position prior to the final resolution of the Council on the introduction of monetary union."
"I therefore implore this House, politely yet forcefully, to support our amendment and allow a split vote on the recommendations of the Ecofin Council, so that we can vote individually on this issue."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Radical Alliance will also vote in favour of Mr Fayot's report, thanking the rapporteur for the speed with which we in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunity have carried out what seemed to be in the general interests."
"I told that Committee, and I confirm it now in Chamber for it to be put on record: I think that, in these proceedings, obviously faced with a series of general contingencies and in the interests of the Union, we have gone beyond the limit of the autonomy, the independence of the rights of the MEPs and Parliament which are guaranteed by our Rules of Procedure."
"We have certainly tried to take into account the requirement that these proceedings should be swift and enable the Union, without upsetting the markets, to take a decision that contemplates Parliament's opinion, but, in doing so, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is basically seeking to interpret it but, in my opinion, he is exaggerating when he says that some rights have been violated - we actually have fewer guarantees of rights, certainly on two or three points."
"That is why, when voting on Mr Fayot's report, I believe that, in the trialogue and in the dialogues we are having with the other institutions, the President should assert our wish for fair cooperation, and should, however, also inform all the other institutions: for example, Council should be told clearly that Parliament is also prepared to do this provided Council is prepared for other forms of cooperation, such as cooperation with the Committees of Inquiry or with other sectors deserving fair cooperation, the cooperation we are prepared to provide and which we would also like to see from the other institutions, from Council and - if Commissioner Kinnock will allow me - from the Commission as well."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report proposed to us by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, is legally questionable and politically inappropriate."
"I have given two reasons in a minority opinion, which appears in the report."
"On a legal level, I maintain that the opinion requested from Parliament is different to an assent."
"The opinion that is requested by article 109j of the Treaty, an opinion given on an Ecofin Council text, in this case, conveyed to a Council meeting at the level of Heads of State and of Government, must be pronounced by Parliament on the basis of a written report including a preamble, a proposal for a resolution and a right to amendment, which is the same whether within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy or within this House."
"It is not possible to disregard this without deliberately violating article 109j of the Treaty."
"I was told: Parliament will sit and give its opinion at the stage of recommendations to the Commission, but the Commission is not the same body as the Council of Ministers."
"The text that it will draw up is legally different."
"The opinion that Parliament will give - which is a non-obligatory opinion - is legally different."
"The report is politically inappropriate. It is inappropriate because Parliament - and it is paradoxical that our group should end up defending the rights of Parliament on such a serious matter - in reality refuses to exercise the authority it draws from the Treaty."
"Technical arguments do not exist."
"You can find a procedure permitting Parliament to have its say."
"How can you imagine that such a serious decision as the implementation of economic and monetary union can be carried out on the basis of an oral report?"
"How can you imagine that MEPs, either together or individually, would not have the right of amendment?"
"How can you imagine that the representatives of the people of the Member States of the European Union are not able to comment on each one of the recommendations that the Ecofin Council's conclusions will cover?"
"They want to gag Parliament."
"We will not accept this, and we will use all the legal means possible to enable us to gain satisfaction in this matter."
"Madam President, I found the last contribution rather surprising because anyone who has observed the process of economic and monetary union over the last 7 ½ years knows that this House has followed the whole process very closely."
"Anyone would think that the debate that we are going to have on 2 May is the first and only time that Parliament has ever looked at the question of economic and monetary union."
"We debate it every month in the Economic Committee."
"We debate it at least every other month in this Parliament and we have done so for the last 7 ½ years."
"I think that some of the contributions today show that those people who have spoken simply do not understand the process that we have undergone since 1990 when stage one of EMU began."
"There are two opportunities for the European Parliament to look at the process of EMU."
"The first will be in the report that Karl von Wogau writes for us where he will look in detail at the information that comes from the European Monetary Institute and the Commission."
"Parliament can then make all of the political points that it needs to make."
"It can build into that report all the new ones that it wants to incorporate."
"We can debate at length in the various committees and in Parliament all of the aspects of the convergence criteria - the effect on employment, the effect on the external exchange rate."
"All of these other points can be debated and I have no doubt that the groups that seem so quick to run for further legal advice will take part in that debate."
"But the most important thing for us to do, having passed the von Wogau report during the Brussels plenary session on 29 and 30 April, is to realize the historic decision that we then have to take on 2 May."
"What the Rules Committee and Mr Fayot have done - and I would like to thank him on behalf of the members of the Economic Committee; I would like to join with Karl von Wogau in thanking him and his colleagues - is to provide an opportunity for Parliament to give its historic seal of approval, after all the lengthy and detailed debates that we have undergone, and make that historic decision."
"If there are political groups in this Chamber who choose to try and make cheap political capital out of 2 May, we will not forget them in this House and I certainly hope that people in Europe do not forget them."
"Madam President, let me first say that I think Mr Fayot has produced a very elegant solution to a very difficult problem."
"In fact I believe this is the only possible solution given the pressure of time under which we have to work."
"However, I would still like to complain that through this accelerated procedure we are turning our opinion into a formality which in practice cannot result in anything but an approval of Ecofin's recommendation."
"As the situation stands, I believe it would have been better almost if we had not given any opinion at all before the Council's decision, quite simply for the simple reason that I am afraid this is going to be seen and represented as an empty gesture from the European Parliament and not as a real exercise of Parliamentary power."
"I am also afraid that it is going to strengthen the impression that the whole EMU project has a very dubious, if not to say bad, democratic basis."
"That is of course not something which Mr Fayot can control."
"His report and solution are the only possible ones, and I can only hope that as many of us as possible vote for the report tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Amendment to Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0400/97) by Mr Ford, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on amending Rule 75 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure (Delegation to Conciliation Committee)."
"Madam President, I promise I will not take anything like five minutes for my report."
"As you said, this is a report on amending Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure, on conciliation."
"It has been argued in the past in this House that Parliament has not been punching its full weight with respect to conciliation and its role in the Conciliation Committee."
"Following a referral by the President of Parliament to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, the Committee has looked at the matter, and it is not our view that Parliament's representatives have in any way been lacking in their efforts to make Parliament's position clear on the Conciliation Committee and, as it were, to ensure that Parliament has the maximum possible say on that important committee."
"However, it was clear that there could be a number of small procedural changes in our rules which would actually help Parliament's side of this work."
"Members will see in front of them three proposed amendments to the procedure, one of which incorporates two small changes."
"Firstly, with respect to Amendment No 2, we propose changing 'may appoint substitutes' to 'shall appoint substitutes' because there have been problems in the past when groups have not had named substitutes available."
"The second amendment removes restrictions on substitutes actually attending meetings when a full Member has attended for part of the time, in other words we would follow the same procedure as laid down at the moment in our committees on the Conciliation Committee."
"Thirdly, we are proposing that the meetings should be not in camera, but merely not public, which would allow the participation of representatives from other institutions and, on occasion, the substitutes who may be called on later."
"Finally, we call on the Conference of Presidents to lay down procedural guidelines because we think that there are other points which are not the purview of the Rules Committee which could aid the functioning of the Conciliation Committees."
"I urge Parliament to support these changes to the Rules for now and to come back and look at this matter after the next European Parliament elections to see if further changes are required."
"Madam President, it is a great pleasure to rise in support of Mr Ford's report."
"These are only small amendments to the Rules of Procedure, but they are highly significant."
"They will put Parliament on an equal footing with the Council in the conciliation procedure itself."
"The Council, up to now, has had an advantage in that the Treaty specifies that the Council or its representatives attend the conciliation meetings and in practice, when necessary, in cases where meetings have gone on longer than expected - as they often do in conciliation, with extra meetings called at short notice - the Council has been able to change its representatives."
"We in Parliament have tied our hands somewhat in not making full use of the possibility of using substitute Members in the Conciliation Committee."
"Very often it is necessary to change representatives at the last minute because of the very nature of negotiations that take place in conciliation."
"These small changes will make it possible for Parliament to do that and thereby place us on an equal footing with the Council in the Conciliation Committee."
"It is timely to introduce that change at this very moment because the Amsterdam Treaty changes the procedure under the Codecision Procedure of the Treaty - the Codecision Procedure which is actually the culmination of Parliament's legislative powers."
"Amsterdam will make it impossible to adopt any legislation that falls under the Codecision Procedure without the explicit agreement of the European Parliament."
"Most codecision, even now, does not require conciliation."
"The two readings in each institution suffice to reach agreement."
"But where the matter does have to go to conciliation, under the Amsterdam Treaty agreement in the Conciliation Committee will be necessary in order for legislation to be adopted."
"Under Maastricht it was possible for the Council to opt out and unilaterally adopt its own text, challenging Parliament to reject that text."
"That will no longer be possible."
"Therefore the significance of the Conciliation Committee is enhanced still further."
"It is absolutely right that at this stage we get our procedures into line to make sure we can take full advantage of that."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"The Group of the European People's Party will be supporting it in its entirety."
"Since it is late and there are few of us present I can be short and brutally frank."
"It is my view that the European Parliament spends too much time wishing it had more power and not enough time effectively implementing the powers it has."
"There is a symbolic and institutional importance in what Mr Ford is doing."
"He is making it easier for us to make coherent and consistent use of the powers we have."
"That is a genuine contribution to closing the democratic deficit."
"It is not as intellectually and politically seductive as all the things we talk about in the Committee on Institutional Affairs but perhaps in the long term it is going to be even more effective and even more important."
"So not merely for administrative and technical reasons but also for political and institutional reasons, we in the Group of the European People's Party will enthusiastically be supporting this report."
"Madam President, I offer my congratulations to Mr Ford and to the other speakers in this heated debate."
"My contribution to the air of unanimity will be to agree with everything that has been said so far."
"Conciliation and codecision were long fought for by Parliament and were a recognition of Parliament's role."
"They were a significant step forward."
"Generally speaking the Council's attendance at these meetings was good, whereas, for whatever reason, Parliament delegations have sometimes been poorly attended."
"This rule change both facilitates and encourages greater participation."
"As Mr Ford explained, the logic behind it, the reasoning and the very clear wording put pressure on political groups and oblige them to provide a substitute so that Parliament will be better represented and can play a full part in all the debates."
"Attendance will be better as will decisions."
"In the end, for parliamentarians, it will be seen as one of the best reports to come before Parliament so far this year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, yesterday there was an unfortunate accident in Asturias, Spain, which caused the death of a miner."
"I raise this matter here because the stoppages and strikes in the Asturian mining industry may get worse, because tension is rising."
"The European Union is involved in this, because the underlying problem in the conflict is that the European Commission has not accepted the plan which had already been negotiated between the Spanish Government and the unions."
"Mr President, would you please ask the Commission to give very careful thought to what is happening in Spain, because I fear tension is rising."
"I would like our sympathy to be expressed, and also a call to the Spanish mining unions and Government to remain calm. However, the Commission must realize that it has to respect what has already been agreed between the unions and the Spanish Government."
"Otherwise, because of the geographical distance between Brussels and the areas in question, it will seem as if the Commission is hiding behind an authoritarian attitude."
"Mrs Garcia Arias, we read about this distressing incident in the newspapers today."
"I have made a note of your comments."
"Mr President, to be brief I will just say that I completely agree with what Mrs García Arias just said."
"Those of us who live in Asturias are very concerned about the Commission's attitude to the mining plan signed by the Spanish Government and the unions in Asturias."
"When you pass on our condolences, could you please also tell the European Commission how worried we are about what is happening."
"The conflict may get worse, and who knows what that might lead to."
"Mr President, concerning the Minutes, page 15, the issue raised by Mr de Vries and Mr Martens."
"I see Commissioner de Silguy in the House and I wonder if he is now prepared to make a statement on what is happening or at least consider the request from Parliament to make a statement."
"Will he make a personal statement today or will President Santer inform the House why it is important at this time of great unemployment in Europe that Commissioners should hold two jobs?"
"Mr McMahon, since we are approving the Minutes, I should inform the House that with regard to the Commission's position on the issue of whether its Members have the right to take on political commitments when they are also Members of the Commission, the Commission has advised me that its President is proposing to make an announcement during our next sittings, on 28 and 29 January in Brussels."
"Consequently, the request of Mr de Vries and of Mr Martens, with which the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Confederal Group of the European United Left- Nordic Green Left agreed, will be granted. This announcement will be made in Brussels."
"Mr President, I seem to have been missed out of the Minutes as the last speaker on Item 11, the White Paper on Railways and Rail Freight Freeways."
"I would be grateful if my name could be included in the list of speakers."
"Mr President, I simply wish to return to the matter raised yesterday by Mr de Vries which you have dealt with."
"I hope the Commission will use its discretion to make such a statement."
"Mr President, I was present at yesterday's session but I forgot to sign in."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"The euro, the capital markets, the consumer and EMU"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0383/97 by Mr Friedrich, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission on the impact of the introduction of the euro on capital markets (COM(97)0337 - C4-0443/97)-A4-0338/97 by Mr Ruffolo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission's working paper on external aspects of economic and monetary union (SEC(97)0803 - C40265/97)-A4-0417/97 by Mr Stevens, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on electronic money and economic and monetary union-A4-0415/97 by Mr Pérez Royo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the euro and the consumer."
"Mr President, the introduction of the euro raises two fundamental problems: that of its internal value and the stability of prices within the European Union; and that of its external value and the stability of its exchange rate."
"The second aspect is the subject of this report. It then examines the foreseeable consequences of the introduction of the euro on the markets; the problems it raises for the EU's exchange policy; the prospects it opens for a new phase of international monetary cooperation; and the specific problem of the use of dollar reserves that may be considered surplus."
"With regard to the first point, it is not possible today to have a clear idea of the market reactions to the introduction of the euro, particularly in the short term."
"Opinion is divided today between those who believe the euro will acquire the characteristics of an international currency capable of rivalling the dollar right from the outset, owing to the extent and power of the economic area it represents, and those who anticipate that it will have to face a phase of distrust and debility owing to the heterogeneity of the area."
"Any forecast is not only difficult, but useless; as the credibility of the euro will be connected with EU monetary policy to a large extent, it is far more useful to concentrate on this."
"The report makes a distinction between two viewpoints in this connection: the short and medium term, and the long term."
"It refuses to raise the question of EU monetary policy in terms of a choice between a strong euro and a weak euro, as this is a false problem."
"The real problem is to ensure a stable euro, without artificial reinforcements and without attempts being made in the opposite direction to promote the competitiveness of the European economy through the weakening of its currency."
"A stable and credible euro, providing a stable balance for the public finances, will enable interest rates to be controlled and therefore the development of investment to be facilitated, reabsorbing the surplus savings that have so far been used to finance public deficits, thus promoting a broader rate of growth."
"Naturally, the stability of the exchange rate depends on American monetary policy and unforeseeable external shocks."
"This poses two problems: that of promoting close monetary cooperation with the United States in our reciprocal interests, and that of ensuring a clear responsibility for the exchange policy within the European Union."
"On this second point, the report notes that there is still an area of institutional ambiguity."
"In the long term, it is to be hoped that EU monetary policy will facilitate the gradual ascent of the euro from European regional currency to world currency with the same dignity as the dollar."
"This will depend on the extent to which the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar reflects the fundamental economic relations between the two areas, and the extent to which it is used in currency and financial transactions by operators outside the European Union."
"The third question relates to the implications of the euro on the international monetary system."
"The elimination of a substantial part of international trade and currencies and the introduction of a totally new currency will radically change the world currency landscape by simplifying it to three fundamental currencies, which will open a totally new chapter in the history of currency, with high risks of volatility and conflict but also with great opportunities for cooperation."
"These opportunities may be collected in a new agreement that promotes a more systematic framework for world currency. The report suggests that the European Union should adopt a political initiative to this effect."
"Finally, with the introduction of the euro, a substantial part of the dollar reserves held today by the European central banks will probably become objectively available."
"So it is a question of choosing between a policy of overprotecting the euro that would decree the sterilization of these resources, and a policy of wise functional use of the objectives of developing and extending the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are 352 days left before the start of the third phase of EMU."
"So far, the successive phases of the timetable fixed in the Treaty are being achieved on time. Today we can say that in all probability the euro will begin to function on 1 January 1999 under the conditions laid down at the European Council in Madrid, and eleven Member States will participate in this third phase right from the outset - that is, virtually all of them except those that have chosen not to do so."
"That means that from that date the euro will become the common currency for about two hundred million European citizens."
"Their attitude to the single currency is crucial in ensuring the final success of this enterprise."
"Throughout the different phases of EMU, its protagonists have been fulfilling their commitments: the Member States have prepared their convergence programmes; the Commission and the Council have carried out their supervisory tasks and elaborated regulatory instruments; the European Monetary Institute has been set up and has started to work properly;"
"Parliament has made the euro one of the priorities of its debates; industry, the credit institutions and the capital markets are getting ready for the new situation which will be created when the euro is introduced."
"Nevertheless, a whole set of unknowns exists in relation to consumers, who are the euro's end users."
"Money or currency is not just an economic concept, but is also symbolic and social - a fundamental part of life within society. The ultimate users are the citizens, who are used to their national currencies, and who are very diverse, having varying levels of education, and a wide range of habits and customs relating to money usage and methods of payment."
"For these citizens - for consumers in general - the introduction of the euro raises a series of problems: use of the euro during the transitional period; exchange between national currencies participating in the euro during that transitional phase; finally moving to euro notes and coins at the end of that phase; the continuity of contracts, especially the so-called accession contracts with telephone and electricity supply companies, etc."
"In tackling these questions, we have tried to favour the views of consumers, as conveyed to us by their representative organizations. In some cases, amendments have been presented to reinforce this position, and we are willing to vote in favour of them."
"Our starting point must be to stress the importance of the change which will happen on 1 January 1999."
"Although notes and coins will not enter circulation until three years later, in 2002, the big change will already have taken place in 1999."
"We need to use the transitional period to ensure that the introduction of the euro is efficient, and to get consumers used to thinking in euros."
"From 1 January next year, it will be possible to use the euro as a means of payment, by cheque or credit card, or in the form of electronic money. We need to promote such usage and guarantee that it does not involve additional costs to users."
"One particular concern is the question of exchange charges or commissions in the final conversion to the euro."
"We think it should be clearly established that conversion will not be subject to charges or commissions."
"It has to be said that the Council's ruling is ambiguous on this point, and therefore in our resolution we ask that the Commission should propose the appropriate amendment to make this clear. This is a question that has repercussions not just for consumers as such, but also for the very credibility of the new currency."
"Similarly, we propose that precise rules should be established for dual pricing in the final phase."
"In conclusion, I should like to stress something which has often been repeated in this Parliament: the success of the euro as far as the European people are concerned depends on them seeing the single currency as being linked to progress in the functioning of the economy, in their own wellbeing, and in solving the basic problems which worry them - starting with unemployment."
"I should just like to finish by saying that I am confident that this is the spirit which will dominate our debate on this report and the others we are considering this morning."
"Given the fact that he is the rapporteur, I shall now call on Mr Stevens to speak. He was delayed, which is unusual for him."
"Members of this House must be here when they are called upon, otherwise this will create problems."
"Mr President, I apologize for being delayed."
"I was held up by an interview on this report and my watch was wrong."
"This report is about the limitations of technology which is, perhaps, appropriate."
"There is a curious coincidence that the timetable for Europe entering the single currency coincides with a technological revolution in the provision of financial services and, indeed, perhaps even in the definition of money itself."
"The advent of electronic money is as big a revolution as the single currency itself."
"The question which my report has looked at, but I fear not resolved, is whether these two processes could be combined."
"There is obviously a huge prize to be gained from doing so."
"European businesses are going to be investing very heavily in information technology for the introduction of the euro."
"It would be logical to combine that investment with a further step forward towards electronic money, either in the form of Internet money or smart-card electronic purses."
"From the point of view of the citizen, the difficulties of moving from their national notes and coins to the new euro notes and coins might indeed have been reduced by creating conditions whereby notes and coins scarcely matter any more, with money largely being held in electronic form."
"In addition, in the case of electronic smart-cards, there would be the possibility of having a calculator function for citizens, to allow them to see the German mark or French franc equivalent of the new euro amounts that they see in the shops in front of them."
"Of course, electronic money has a whole range of other implications for central banking and for banking supervision."
"However, the opportunity that undoubtedly exists in this area is one that, I regret to say, the Commission, the European Monetary Institute and national governments seem very reluctant to take up."
"They seem to have concluded that the shift to the single currency is such a big step for our citizens to go through that to complicate the issue with a technological revolution is altogether asking too much."
"They have concluded that the pace at which electronic money is likely to come into European economies is not sufficiently fast for it to be a factor by 1 January 2002."
"They are probably right in that assessment if they adopt a passive attitude towards this development."
"However, I would say that if they had adopted a more active attitude and recognized the huge potential of this technology the story might have been different - but so be it!"
"The function of my report, therefore, is a rather modest one."
"What was initially envisaged as a spur to action by the Commission, the Council and the European Monetary Institute should now be regarded merely as a warning shot."
"The euro is going to revolutionize the European economy."
"It is going to massively increase the competitive capacity of our economy in global terms, but the introduction of electronic money has that potential too."
"The pace at which Europe becomes an electronic market-place is going to determine the pace at which Europe becomes a true information society."
"And ultimately, Europe's competitive position in the world is going to depend on how fast we do that."
"So I feel an opportunity is being lost here."
"I, myself, believe that the rather modest calculations of the pace at which electronic money is going to come into the economy may well prove to be mistaken."
"If you look at Internet money in the United States that has come through much more quickly."
"My task is the modest one of warning our partners in the Commission, the Council and in Member State governments that this interface between the introduction of the euro and the advent of electronic money is something which we have to watch very carefully."
"I hope that my rather pessimistic assessment is not proved correct by events."
"Mr President, with the interests of the EU primarily in mind, the creation of the euro may also be of great significance to the other areas of the world."
"This may be the case, for all the indications are that it will be a widely established currency."
"Already today, around 30 % of world payments are made with all the various European currencies."
"But the significance of a single currency will certainly be greater, with an added attraction, apart from payments, of financial applications and the formation of reserves by the issuing banks."
"This is in line with the growing use of the main European currencies in recent years, with the simultaneous weakening of the world prevalence of the dollar: from 50 % to 42 % in payments between 1990-95, from 67 % to 40 % in financial applications between 1981 and 1995, and from 76 % to 6.5 % as a reserve currency between 1973 and 1995."
"The prospects open to the euro are thus an additional reason for making the EU take responsibility, making it important for it to be a strong and stable currency with the correct balance, avoiding penalizing our exports by overvaluation, while, if undervalued, it would lose credibility and have inflationist consequences."
"In view of the desirability of its world-wide acceptance, we need an immediate broad dissemination campaign in the various areas of the world, a point to which I would particularly like to draw the Commissioner's attention, as we suggested in the report we made to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"The European campaign is obviously important, but we cannot put off a world campaign, accompanied by other appropriate measures."
"This campaign and these measures cannot be uniform, in view of different situations, with the overall numbers mentioned in the report on the general use of the euro saying little on that account."
"More specifically, we should not, for example, confuse areas such as non-euro Europe and a large part of Africa (which by fact or law forms part of a large euro area) with Latin America, North America or Asia, where the prospects opened in the fields of payments, financial applications and the formation of reserves by issuing banks are in some way significant, as is the intention already shown by the Bank of China of holding 30 % of its reserves in euros, in a continent where the yen does not take priority."
"Measures aimed at all areas of the world are therefore important."
"To conclude, the prospects being opened up on a horizon where the euro will give Europe a greater role, in its interests and in the interests of the world economy, are significant."
"Mr President, I am addressing Mr Friedrich's report, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"I would like to congratulate the Commissioner for the work he has accomplished, and perhaps even more congratulate the Giovannini group which, it appears to me, has comprehensively staked out the ground covering the question."
"Mr Friedrich is putting forward an ambitious, long and substantial resolution."
"So much the better!"
"There are few legal questions raised in connection with this report."
"The problem of continuity of contract was already settled by the regulations which we examined some time past, and the report now basically deals with regulations to be adopted, either by the national authorities of the Member States, or by professional organizations."
"Hence, our comments relate mainly to the wider legal framework which is to accompany the introduction of the euro and which, in the financial markets field, clearly has to deal with the issue of European company statutes."
"It is high time that this question should come out into the open, and along with it, mutual investment fund organizations, and at a later date, tax harmonization."
"As regards consumer protection - we are dealing here with paragraph 23 of Mr Friedrich's resolution and this subject was of course touched on in the report from Mr Pérez Royo - I would like to come back to you, Mr Commissioner."
"You know that I am very concerned about the protection of consumers against fraud, but I am just as opposed to confusing consumers, and I believe it is important to give incentives to Member States to introduce efficient structures for small claims settlement."
"Furthermore, it will be unavoidably necessary, at one time or another, to get back to work on the problem of repressing criminality through the third pillar, or by means of conventions."
"Now that the euro is off the launchpad, we should be looking at this."
"I would therefore like to hear your views."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work."
"I joined this Parliament in 1989 and I was Parliament's first rapporteur, along with Mr Cox, on economic and monetary union."
"We have travelled quite a distance in terms of the technical work to finally complete this important project."
"If you look at these reports and the work that we have undertaken on economic and monetary union, despite the difficulties that we have had, including the economic downturn in the early 1990s, we have now reached a point where the momentum behind economic and monetary union is unstoppable."
"If you look at the biggest players in the financial services sector they have based their strategic decisions over the past few years on the assumption that EMU will indeed go ahead."
"We have seen recently a wave of mergers and restructuring that spread throughout the financial services sector."
"In the private sector as a whole there has been large-scale investment in the updating of information technology systems and the retraining of staff."
"All this marks the transition to economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999."
"This demonstrates that when the European Union sets itself clear targets and when it sets itself realistic timetables, we can achieve great things in this Europe."
"Since it started its first phase in 1990 the EMU project has had clear targets."
"It has had a manageable timetable and, of course, that is why we will achieve the single currency on 1 January 1999."
"In less than four months, the Council will take that final important decision, and as a Parliament we have to look beyond that decision of 2 May and the start of the EMU on 1 January 1999 and set ourselves a new agenda within the European Parliament."
"It is no good sitting here self-satisfied with the fact that we have created the single currency; we have to see how we apply that single currency and what role it is going to have in our lives."
"Today I would like to set out some of the priorities for my group over the coming years."
"We need to learn an important lesson from the financial turmoil in south-east Asia."
"A currency must be stable and we must be able to demonstrate its stability."
"Therefore the pact for stability and growth is extremely important indeed."
"We in this Parliament must make sure that it is applied rigorously so that we can protect the stability of our currency."
"Secondly, our group wants to see greater steps made in economic coordination."
"I would say to the Commissioner today, because I know that his services are working on the annual economic report at the moment, that we would like to know exactly what the new annual economic report will look like."
"What will the broad economic guidelines look like in terms of building this new strengthened economic coordination?"
"We would like to have a dialogue with you over the next couple of weeks to ensure that the broad economic guidelines for the future are what we actually require in this new European environment."
"We want to ensure that the European Bank is independent."
"No one in this house would challenge that, but there is no reason why an independent bank should not also be accountable."
"We need to apply ourselves very carefully, particularly in the context of Mrs Randzio-Plath's report, to how we make that bank accountable."
"It is our job here in the European Parliament to do that."
"That means, President, and I say this to you because you are a member of Parliament's Bureau, we need to restructure the committees of the European Parliament."
"We need a Banking Committee in the European Parliament that deals with financial services and which will deal with the European Central Bank in the same way that nations like the United States of America have a powerful Banking Committee."
"We in our group will pursue this over the next few months."
"What will be the role of national parliaments in this whole new environment?"
"Will we be so arrogant as to believe that we do not need to have a relationship with national parliaments?"
"We need at least informally to build a relationship with national parliaments and I will be taking steps in the next few weeks to do this, hopefully with colleagues from across the Chamber."
"We should set up a European Economic Forum where national parliaments and Members of this European Parliament can meet to monitor carefully economic coordination and the role of the European Central Bank."
"I hope that some in this room will join in that endeavour."
"My last point is in relation to the citizens and the consumer."
"We have done the technical work but we have not yet sold the message to the public."
"Our job as a European Parliament, your job as a Commission and the job of the Council is to make sure that between now and 1 January 1999, and particularly 2002, the citizens accept and welcome all the work that we have done and the creation of that single currency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, I wish to address the excellent report by our colleague Ingo Friedrich."
"The Commission's proposal is based on the principle that market harmonization, which will accompany the introduction of the euro, is a subject of great interest for the financial markets."
"This proposal has come at just the right time, and I would here like to congratulate Mr Friedrich for the contents of this report."
"In paragraph 11, the resolution rightly raises the fact that dividends and redemptions of pension funds, life assurance and property funds are made in local currency, which means that a substantial portion of the funds must remain in the country of origin according to the principle of congruence."
"In reality, thanks to monetary union, the whole of the monetary space of the EU will become a single territory."
"This considerably enlarges the field of action for invested capital, and it is at this point that the full scope of the challenge faced by the EU with regard to the United States arises, as regards the capital markets and the future of the savings and investment sector at the global level, both in the medium and longer term."
"It is vital for the future of Europe that the Member States, for example, re-examine the question of a strict, quantitative limit to be placed on the value of their pension funds, in the run up to the introduction of the euro."
"If I take the example of France, a tool such as the internal market for financial instruments is visibly of particular importance."
"The MATIF, which is one of the most important futures markets in Europe, if not the most important, should be able to continue to develop and compete with the futures market of the United States."
"We need also to bear in mind the determining importance of the euro with regard to the monthly scheduling of debt."
"On the other hand, the internal capital market, now euro denominated, depends clearly on the continuing good quality of the loans already issued, which is ample justification for the stability pact, whose purpose is to guarantee repayment of loans already contracted to lenders at constant value."
"Mr Friedrich's report specifically deals with the impact of the introduction of the euro on the capital markets."
"In the light of the recent problems affecting NAFTA, one can draw the conclusion that limiting oneself to a free-trade area can lead up a blind alley."
"This shows that the Community's approach, one of an integrated economic and monetary space, on the basis of a whole set of precise and coordinated policies, is quite justified, an approach indefatigably advocated by Commissioner de Silguy."
"We need to regard EMU both as a logical follow-up to the single market, and also as a teaching tool, popularizing European integration and enlargement."
"For the western European countries, the euro represents the dynamism associated with the completion of the ordered competitive market place."
"The decisive initiative here is membership of monetary union."
"Monetary union also assumes - and here I have in mind our eastern European friends, who are all called on subject to certain conditions to join the EU in the longer term - that pan-European convergence will be the result both of international flexibility and of the planned approach to economic and monetary union adopted by the countries of Europe who have been able to overcome their scepticism and have resolved to go down that path to the future."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party I wish to address the report by Mr Ruffolo."
"The Union has come through quite a long period of introspection in economic terms as we have sought to create the required convergence for monetary union."
"This report has come forward now that we are on the threshold of achieving our objective and it is entirely timely to ask what should be the external purpose of and role of the euro."
"One thing is very clear: the new European monetary area, though it is wholly open to trade, will have a very different degree of openness to the separate Member State economies."
"In fact, it is in that context, in a global market, that the euro perhaps offers its greatest potential to Europe for the future and to the single market in particular."
"With regard to the exchange rate, I agree with the rapporteur."
"A central issue for the external role of the euro is stability."
"In that context, the role of politicians is to look at economic fundamentals in the real economy; the role of politicians is to achieve an appropriate level of convergence; the role of politicians is to define what is the desirable level of price stability internally."
"But when those elements are set, it is the role of the Central Bank to call the monetary policy mix, and we need not at this stage reopen old debates."
"The unknown quantity in regard to the external value of the euro is clear: it is the speed and extent to which the euro has the market-base capacity to become a reserve currency and what the implications of that would be in feed-back terms for internal policy, which at the moment is conjectural."
"In summary for the Liberal Group I would say, as between the politicians' role and the Bank, let us render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto the Bank what is determined in the Treaty."
"Mr President, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that we face a revolution."
"Its elements consist of what we speak of here today, the advent of the euro and electronic money."
"To these, I would add two more: the growing trade taking place on the Internet, which might cause problems for individual states to collect taxes and thus fund the welfare state; and the fact that the year 2000 might cause some computer systems to fail."
"All these factors together will bring about changes in the behaviourial patterns of the economy."
"There is also the psychological question."
"This will certainly be something that companies, the public sector and educators will have to deal with."
"Hence, there are many unknown factors which can endanger the EU economy."
"That is why I support totally Alan Donnelly's proposal that there should be some kind of Banking Committee in Parliament to discuss these matters."
"It would also be important as a factor in improved risk awareness, because there is a special need for risk awareness in this area."
"Mr Friedrich mentions something in his report that may raise our hopes on this issue: when the national currency risk disappears, so too does one factor that affects differentials in interest rates."
"This may have a stabilizing effect."
"Finally, I would like to say that the EU must now dare to create a counterweight to monetary union in the shape of a common economic policy, particularly in the area of taxation, but also to be able to defend the European economic policy model."
"It will differ, obviously, from other regional models."
"It would thus be very important to create mechanisms to ensure that the European partners, at various times in their recent history engulfed in recession, do not get into inordinate economic difficulties."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly addressing the Stevens report."
"There is virtually nothing to stand in the way of the take-off of electronic money in Europe, except the deafening silence and ""wait and see' attitude of political and economic decision-makers in Europe."
"I therefore congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and its rapporteur, Mr Stevens, for this initiative, in which he has reflected on what could indeed be one of the great challenges of tomorrow's society - the control of electronic money."
"In the light of the two revolutions which are currently causing a radical upheaval in European financial practice - and here I mean the introduction of the single currency and the development of digital moneys of account - how can we not conceive of the introduction of new forms of payment, and more particularly, of the re-definition of money and currency itself, and of the role of the banks and the supervisory authorities?"
"In the last few years, the maelstrom affecting the telecommunications sector has profoundly changed banking."
"Electronic banking has become part of day-to-day consumer practice in Belgium, with the massive use of the 'Proton' card."
"The same will soon be true of France, with the electronic purse sold by the Post Office."
"As my colleagues have already said, we can but be delighted at the move from the magnetic strip to the on-board chip card, whether disposable, re-chargeable, or re-programmable."
"The virtual purse should have a tremendous future ahead of it, as the advantages it presents are many and varied."
"It works both for customers and for European retailers. It also has the advantage of providing users with greater security, by supplying the virtual account with money transferred from the account-holder's credit card."
"Disclosure of the number of one's carte bleue -style banker's card can be avoided, and there will be no need to dispose safely of the ticket issued by the cash dispenser when money is paid out."
"But while Europe is currently in the lead of on-board chip technology - as the rapporteur reminded us in his introduction - is it not true that the very sinews of electronic money are the manner in which it is to be controlled and supervised?"
"Contrary to the rapporteur - and here I am referring to Paragraph C - I believe the commercial battle will rage on the Internet rather than in the field of the virtual purse, for the simple reason that the whole thing is at present firmly American orchestrated."
"Is there not a tremendous risk that the national banking authorities, or the future European Central Bank, will be stripped of their supervisory power by the telecommunications multi-nationals over the next twenty years?"
"Even now as we reflect on the question, our governments are staying quiet, and major manoeuvres have already begun on the other side of the Atlantic, alliances are being struck between the major American multi-nationals in the multimedia field and the main global institutions specializing in bank card-mediated and processed banking transactions - the alliance between Netscape Communication and First Data, or Microsoft and Visa International, for example. They have but one objective, which is to bear down on all of us, Europeans that we are, with their hegemony."
"In the United States, the multi-nationals, with the support of the White House, have long since understood that control of the cyber-economy, by means of technological mastery, will give them victory in the only battle they seem to care about - the information revolution."
"I am sounding the alarm while we still have time. The proper operation of the single currency, the competitiveness of the European Union, and the stability of our European financial system, are so many reasons for governments to take urgent measures."
"Mr President, this report, which is brimful with optimism, should not blind us to the fact that the introduction of the single currency has forced our countries to adopt the policy of austerity, a policy which was welcome after the years of budgetary laisser faire and which - particularly in Belgium - led to astronomical public debt."
"But this austerity has severely penalized the most disadvantaged, those for whom the euro provides no prospect of improvement in living standards."
"At the same time, if we are to believe the promises made last summer by the President of the French Republic to the Prince of Monaco, the Council and the Commission are seriously envisaging granting the Principality the benefits of the euro - at a time when the Principality is promoting tax evasion on a gigantic scale, to the detriment of the interests of the Member States - without there being any requirement on the residents of Monaco to make the slightest financial effort."
"Such a gift to the wealthy would be an act of immorality and an insult to the financially disadvantaged, who will have to continue to tighten their belts for a very long time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year from now we will be living in the euro era."
"This should be a golden era in which international currencies are linked together in a climate of monetary stability."
"I agree with Mr Ruffolo, the rapporteur, that it will be very difficult to achieve balanced and stable monetary relations in the short term. Nevertheless I believe, as the crisis in Asia has made very clear, that we will very soon have to create political control mechanisms in the world, to help ensure that the real economy is not jeopardized by turbulence on the currency markets at the cost of workers and the economic development of world prosperity."
"That is why I believe European monetary union can make a contribution not only to achieving a reasonable situation as regards competition between today's world currencies, but also to developing international monetary stability and also normality in the significance of world currencies to each other in relation to trade and economic conditions."
"So the European Parliament and the European Commission are right in attaching great importance to stability and to the international dimension of the euro."
"I deeply regret that until now the Council of Ministers has not made it clear that the European Union will speak with one voice on monetary matters in the euro era."
"We cannot have a monetary union and yet continue to voice differing views in international financial organizations or at G8 or G10 meetings."
"We have already had painful experiences of the downside of this, during the Uruguay Round and also in the World Trade Organization."
"We should not repeat this mistake in monetary matters."
"I hope, therefore, that the role of the Commission will be enhanced in view of the international dimension of the euro."
"Moreover, the European Parliament has rightly demonstrated in today's debate that it is important not just to want European monetary union, but also to carefully prepare the way for it. This is necessary to allay people's fears, fears easily exploited by opponents of European monetary union by creating the impression that monetary union is actually monetary reform, leading to concerns about the value of their money and their purchasing power."
"By preparing the way, we must make it clear to people that EMU involves bringing together equally sound currencies, so that we can pay all over the European Union with equally sound money."
"And this will reassure citizens, who are worried about the stability of their money and who want to see their savings and income safeguarded, that their concern is being taken into account in the run-up to EMU."
"That is why it is so important that we as a European Parliament should take up arms for consumer protection as part of the debate on EMU."
"It is also high time the Commission brought forward a further euro regulation, to ensure that there is no cost to the consumer in converting from national currencies to the euro, that any kind of conversion fraud or abuse is ruled out, and, above all, this regulation should provide for dual pricing."
"We really must take our citizens with us on the road to EMU, not stir up their fears."
"This will only be possible if, during the euro's introductory phase and during the phase when the euro and national currencies are used side by side, it is really possible to check and to understand the cost of goods, services and even charges for public services, both in euros and in the national currency."
"Commissioner, the European Parliament requested this last year."
"I think it is in the interest of a successful monetary union, which will be judged not only by the reaction of the markets but also by the reaction of our citizens, that the Commission should finally present us with a regulation of this kind."
"After all, the euro is for everyone, and we need to speed up the process through European legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to continue where Mrs Randzio-Plath left off, that is on the issues dealt with in Mr Pérez Royo's report, the euro and consumer protection."
"I think it is right for the Commission to pay sufficient attention to consumer protection from the Commission's point of view, but we must not overshoot the mark."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, you yourself know as well as I do that if dual pricing is to extend - as suggested in Mr Pérez Royo's report - from the beginning of the third phase, that is from 1 January 1999, possibly on an optional basis initially, but then if this is not satisfactory, backed up by the force of a regulation, this will of course have a big influence on costs in commerce and may push them up."
"So I should like to sound a warning note about the extent of consumer protection."
"Paragraph 14 of Mr Pérez Royo's proposal, which is right on many points and which I generally fully support, asks the Commission to establish regional observatories."
"What kind of suggestion is that?"
"Do we need regional observatories?"
"Anyone suggesting this, and they may indeed get a majority for it in the vote at noon today, has failed to understand that the EU regulation under Article 235 of the EC Treaty already deals with all matters of civil law: continuity of contracts, the conversion from ECU to euros at a 1: 1 rate, rounding rules and so on."
"I believe that wherever there is competition, and that is the case in commerce throughout Europe, and wherever suppliers have to prove themselves on the market, there will not be any funny business, because consumers would soon notice."
"I am rather unhappy about the idea of everyone engaged in commerce being labelled as potential criminals and all consumers as potential idiots."
"Every consumer will have only one conversion rate from his or her old national currency to the euro."
"Just one rate!"
"Consumers will be told that rate on 4 May 1998, and there is no question of that being settled by some voluntary arrangement."
"There will be pocket calculators with an extra button - they already exist, in fact."
"So that simply will not be a problem, and I am willing to bet that within 48 hours, perhaps just 24 hours, consumers will have caught on to the conversion rate, and nobody will be able to hoodwink them after that."
"There is one exception, namely monopolies, especially public sector monopolies."
"In that area we will have to watch that the introduction of the euro is not used to sneak in price increases."
"But, necessary as consumer protection is, we must not overdo it."
"Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the various rapporteurs on their reports."
"I believe that the success of economic and monetary union will largely depend on the way in which our citizens are prepared for the introduction of the single currency."
"We have only to talk to our constituents to recognize this."
"Our people have concerns."
"There is therefore a need to ensure that the euro is explained and that any misunderstandings are dealt with."
"This obligation is naturally on the Union and the Member State governments."
"I call on the Commission today to agree to, and to finance, a national and European 'euro hotline' to protect consumers' and business' interests as we embark on this great initiative."
"It is essential that information, training and education campaigns are put in place for all our citizens as well as businesses."
"European citizens need to be convinced that the single currency will not be against their interest, nor that of their country."
"They need to be reassured that the euro will strengthen our economies and that it will demonstrate the real strength of Europe in the world, resulting in lower interest rates which will put more money into our peoples' pockets."
"On the introduction of the euro it will be essential that there is an assurance that the cost of introducing it will not fall on the consumer."
"There must be a rounding down in favour of the consumer."
"When prices are converted consumers must also be shown how to easily calculate the conversion from the Member State currency into the euro."
"Dual pricing is essential and should be introduced prior to January 1999."
"It is important that consumers become accustomed to the pricing before 2002."
"It is vitally important that counterfeit money be detected, including the use of counterfeit coins in machines."
"One of the distinctive advantages of the euro is that it will enable consumers in my country and elsewhere to compare the prices of goods and services, including tourism products."
"The cost of a holiday in the west and north of Ireland indeed will show up very favourably."
"It will also help cross-border sales."
"I believe that the euro will provide a positive boost to competition."
"It will ensure transparency in pricing; it will ensure exchange rate and interest rate stability; it will stifle currency speculation and will stimulate growth in employment."
"I believe that the national authorities must ensure that there is adequate and intelligible information on the real cost of introducing the euro, together with adequate information for consumers in order to guarantee competition and to detect and stop unjustified price rises - hence my call for a 'euro hotline' ."
"In conclusion, as I have already stated in this House, the euro notes must be friendly to the visually impaired."
"There is an obligation on all of us to ensure that."
"I would like yet again to clear up one thing. I understand that it is impossible, in one minute, even for an orator like you, Mr Nordmann, to develop your thoughts."
"However, I have repeatedly requested the political groups not to allocate their members one minute of speaking time."
"I regard this as a matter of dignity. Unfortunately, you are given one minute of time and we are in a difficult position, both you and the presidency."
"We also have a programme which is not being adhered to."
"But one minute must not turn into two minutes."
"Mr President, all four reports under debate are characterized by a general euphoria about the introduction of the single currency."
"However, we must not lose sight of the fact that our effort to promote and secure the euro as an international currency and to ensure its stability on international markets is being carried out in the context of the implementation of austerity programmes, strict monetary discipline, the dictates of the stability pact and, finally, in the context of total upheaval in the jobs market and the dwindling of workers' security and social rights."
"At the same time, developments on global money markets simply confirm the intense anxiety regarding the economic progress of those countries that do not conform."
"The Commission is under an obligation to study the repercussions and the powerful side effects on the weaker economies, such as in Greece for example, but also in other countries outside and inside the euro which are more vulnerable to international speculative pressures."
"The workers and people of Europe cannot accept having to mortgage their future for the sake of the euro and the aspirations of European credit finance capital to obtain a hard currency in order to win speculative games on the capital markets of the world."
"For this reason, Mr President, they will react, and for this reason account must be taken of their anxieties."
"Mr President, we need to say something here about the economic substance of the revolution which we are signing up to on all sides."
"I have in mind the immediate de-localization of credit money, whose localized vulnerability we are currently witnessing."
"The fact that credit money is now being jeopardized all over the world by the present crisis in Asia is just one indication of this."
"We are thus witnessing a new degree of separation of monetary cycles from the real economy and from the primary income that can only be derived from that economy, and accordingly also from the material reproduction capacity of economic structures as a component of a complex world society with increasingly global problems and planet-wide responsibility."
"This is the context in which we are preparing to introduce the euro."
"Mr Ruffolo, a stable and credible euro will not, in the medium and long term, be a consequence of monetary policy, either solely or even primarily."
"It will be determined by the credibility of the European Union, by which I mean here the extent to which it can find democratically workable answers for the future."
"I am still not convinced that the neo-liberal plan for a revolutionary micro-economy society which Mr Stevens has presented to us, which tries to turn all interaction into buyer/seller, creditor/debtor or quite simply market-related interaction, is the right model to guarantee this future capability. We cannot just see our citizens as consumers."
"Mr Donnelly, we know that the plan has now become unstoppable, and that the euro will be introduced."
"What is at issue now is what is still possible, even if Luxembourg I and Luxembourg II have only yielded unsatisfactory results, by revising the conditions for the introduction of the euro."
"I can only describe this in headlines here."
"We need an effective European employment policy."
"We need economic policy coordination which amounts to more than generating paper but instead establishes a real framework and sets real objectives."
"We need to end all forms of dumping and competition for the location of investment projects in the internal market, whether it takes the form of taxation, environmental standards, social security arrangements or subsidies."
"We need to allow the European Central Bank and also the European Central Banking System to establish themselves as part of a wide-ranging social and economic policy process."
"In other words, instead of a micro-economic revolution, we need the courage to introduce greater democracy, especially in economic and social policy, so that our citizens, who are now becoming more active, are given greater power and fresh perspectives."
"Mr President, this Parliament might be able to make a good impression with this debate on EMU."
"In an economic sense Europe is flourishing, after all."
"The number of nations forecasted to join EMU has never been so high."
"For Italy, Spain, and Portugal, membership is on the horizon."
"France and Germany have to pull out all the stops, but will manage, as they are indispensable EMU participants in a political sense."
"The jubilant mood about EMU is very understandable, but also very dangerous."
"It is politicians, civil servants and bankers who primarily feel that way."
"But Dutch voters think differently: 47 % of them expect it to be delayed, while only 18 % expect EMU to start on 1 January 1999 with a large group of countries."
"This means an enormous gap exists between the decision to be made on 2 May 1998, and what the people think the decision will be."
"Those who think EMU will go ahead because there is proper economic convergence are wrong."
"Formal Treaty criteria are met."
"But in reality, there are big differences in economic and conjunctural developments."
"Nor by any means are all results in the sphere of public finances based on structural measures."
"EMU will not take place as a result of convergence having been achieved, but because important politicians have thrown their lot in with it."
"Four German professors recently made public their opinion on this point."
"They warn of unstable exchange rates if the euro loses its credibility as a result of the participation of economically weaker countries."
"The effects on employment are also painted too rosily."
"They will be positive for prosperous regions, but for weaker regions a negative effect is more to be expected."
"Likewise, other economic risks of EMU are ignored."
"If these become manifest, then EMU has a problem."
"Faith in the euro will be tested."
"It will be difficult as an MEP to explain why the euro is good for the European consumer."
"Mr President, my comments are limited to Mr Stevens' report."
"I consider the initiative underlying this report to be extremely valuable, but it should not be viewed simply in connection with introducing the euro."
"Europe is a leader in the field of smart-card technology, and we must exploit that situation."
"Increased use of electronic money would be a further step in the information society, and would have a positive impact on our citizens' lives."
"The versatility of smart-card technology could also be used to rationalize administration in the public services sector, allowing substantial budget savings to be made in the medium term."
"It would have extremely important consequences if this Parliament initiative boosted willingness to cooperate within the Council, and if the various national initiatives in the field of smart-card technology at least became compatible."
"Promoting electronic money is an investment in development in tune with the spirit of the times."
"So it is even more amazing that this technological revolution in the payment systems our citizens use has so far scarcely featured in the overall strategy for introducing the euro."
"Developments in information and communications technology will also soon have an impact on the way we use money."
"Progress in electronic payment systems affects the very idea of money, and we shall have to face up to the consequent fiscal, legal, economic and even political challenges."
"I accordingly welcome Mr Stevens' report."
"However, it would be helpful if at least part of the budget set aside for advertising the euro could be used to prepare our citizens for the imminent technological change in our money system."
"Mr President, in 11 months time 11 countries will enter economic and monetary union here in Europe."
"The goal of our single currency aspirations will be scored by this first team of 11 players with four countries on the substitutes bench, limbering up, ready to join the fray later, perhaps before the next World Cup in 2002."
"But even at this eleventh hour there is much to do to ensure that the goalposts are up and not moved, that the pitch is level and fit for play and that the ball is hard enough to score goals for Europe right from the kick-off."
"These four reports before us today deal with some of the last-minute anxieties and hopes."
"The Pérez Royo report rightly identifies concerns of some of the single currencies-watching spectators."
"Consumers will need to be assured, for instance, that once the ball of the single currency is in play, the double pricing in the euro and in the home money is the rule, not the exception."
"If retailers are not prepared to help customers orient themselves to these historic changes, then Parliament should blow its whistle and be prepared to legislate to ensure double pricing."
"So too with potential conversion costs associated with the advent of the euro."
"Whether we are talking of phase B where national currencies might be exchanged, or phase C where the new euro coins could be exchanged for dying denominations, charging the man or woman on the street or boulevard for exchanging currencies will be a disaster, especially since we have sold the euro to the citizens as the currency which eliminates such wasteful exchange costs."
"We must guard against just such an own-goal."
"In addition, it is imperative that the public authorities monitor closely the change over to the euro."
"Suspicions by the consumers that the euro will be used to mask price hikes must be zealously tackled and tripped up."
"There are many older people in Britain today who recall 1971 decimalization as a time to cry foul against the ticket touts making money out of those unfamiliar with a new currency."
"I hope that the Commission will agree to draw up proposals for regulations concerning cost reconversion of such coins and notes."
"If the Pérez Royo report deals with the near future, Mr Stevens' essay on electronic money treats of a future which is fast moving towards us."
"Using smart cards and electronic purses will soon be second nature to us all."
"Perhaps, as the rapporteur has argued in earlier debates, acceptance of EMU might have been promoted by linking it to new technologies like electronic money."
"Less sound is his proposal that a single private sector organization might have been entrusted with the responsibility for issuing such encrypted money."
"Whatever the future of such developments, Parliament should insist from the issuers of electronic money, as with a bank or other institutions, that the requirement of public confidence, interoperability and the continuing stability of the financial systems should be met by the competent authorities."
"With reference to the Ruffolo report on certain external aspects of the euro, I would corroborate the rapporteur's concern regarding the external representation of the European Community on bodies like, for instance, the IMF."
"Clarification of the responsibilities between Ecofin and the Central Bank is required sooner rather than later."
"One concluding comment: the current severe disruption of the Asian financial markets makes it all the more imperative that EMU is launched on a solid basis."
"A stable euro will be good for Europe and good for the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to refer to the Friedrich report and congratulate the rapporteur for dealing with one of the most important areas of institutionalization of the capital market."
"At the moment, it is fragmented and there is competition between each of the European financial markets, and between these and the world financial markets."
"This report indicates that the introduction of the euro in stock exchange transactions and listings as from 1 January 1999 will solve all the problems and distortions which exist between the various investors of the Member States of the Union, and marks an important stage in the harmonization of the process of establishing the European market."
"It is a very optimistic report because not all the problems of the financial markets will be resolved."
"We do not fully share this nominal and formal view, but we share the idea that the various convergences must exist."
"And in fact legal and tax barriers still exist that cannot be overcome, as the report recognizes and which, on that account, cannot mean that only the euro can overcome them."
"With regard to the tax barriers, we wish to point out that each country handles and wants to continue to handle internal taxes and the respective collection systems for withholding at source or, finally, solely on the basis of their needs to attract public loans, through State securities or debentures."
"Will the euro answer this question?"
"I think not."
"They will say: ""It is a result of the rule of unanimity' ."
"Will it be?"
"Since when have common interests been unresolved, even if consent and unanimity are required?"
"What is happening, and this report does not deal with this issue, is that each of the countries attracting investment raises its interests above those in need of it."
"When these objectives are met, the aims of this report will then be achieved."
"Mr President, electronic money is a serious issue and it really deserved separate consideration rather than being lumped in a general debate about the euro."
"I am pleased that Mr Stevens and the Group of the European People's Party eventually felt able to accept the Liberal amendments, which were endorsed by the committee, because without those changes, it was doubtful whether we would be in a position to support his report today."
"This report comes at an important time in the development of electronic money."
"The new technology, already under development in many Member States, is the subject of discussion within the Commission, the European Monetary Institute and the Member States."
"But by adopting his report now, before the other institutions, the European Parliament can send a strong signal that the development of electronic money must not be impeded by excessive regulation and incompatible standards."
"The purpose of my amendments was to send that signal and to remove anti-competitive elements present in the rapporteur's first draft."
"The report now provides a regulatory framework which will ensure the confidence of the public in electronic money, the stability and the soundness of issuers and the smooth functioning of the single market."
"We must ensure that such a framework allows all appropriately regulated entities, banks and non-banks, to issue electronic money on a competitive basis, and does not restrict competition through a franchise system or by limiting the market to banks alone."
"Interoperability will be a crucial factor in the development of electronic money."
"We must ensure that different electronic purses and smart cards are based on interoperable standards, to prevent fragmentation of the market and the development of an anti-competitive cartel."
"Finally, a regulatory regime must not interfere in pricing policies."
"If companies have invested in the development of this money, they must not be obliged to issue products for free."
"The market should determine the pricing, leaving customers free to choose."
"With those provisos, I am happy to endorse this report."
"Mr President, I have three comments to make."
"Firstly, with the euro, crises and disturbances in the economy are going to spread more rapidly on the capital markets, and Europe risks having an Asian situation."
"Secondly, democracy is being eroded."
"Elected politicians are being converted into lackeys with the task of serving and facilitating movements on the capital markets."
"We are getting a system which nobody will control and which will never control itself."
"Thirdly, this debate shows a massive conformity of views."
"What kind of parliament is it where 95 % of the debate consists of eulogies to one and the same idea?"
"There is no room here for a deeper critical scientific analysis."
"This orthodoxy is frightening in view of the fact that all attempts from 1873 to 1993 to create these kinds of currency structures have led to depression and then collapse."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the prior question has not been dealt with."
"Before coming to technical aspects, we would need to be assured that the peoples of Europe really wish to join the euro."
"This would require national referenda in all countries on a reform of this importance, if only out of respect for the electors."
"Furthermore, the consequences of the extension of the deutschmark to the former East Germany are only too visible in the shape of unemployment in the East and rising taxes in the West, at enormous cost down the years."
"This is what happens when a single currency is imposed on two countries which differ in competitiveness."
"And I am not talking about the moral aspect of this experiment, the scorn of the East by the West in a society where money is the measure of all things."
"The scenario risks being the same in Europe."
"The countries in which companies have competitiveness problems will experience rising unemployment."
"The more productive countries will sooner or later have to sign up to giving a minimum of assistance in solidarity payments, and taxes will rise."
"Changing the denomination of the currency will also hit the consumer's pocket with inflation."
"In eastern Europe, the creation of national currencies in Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia or in other countries was experienced at the time as a liberation."
"It enabled these countries to move over to the market economy in the best conditions."
"Curiously, in western Europe, people are doing the opposite."
"However, the sound monetary health of Switzerland or Norway demonstrates all the attractiveness of national currencies."
"In a word, it serves no useful purpose to get into a technical debate without resolving the prior question of the creation of the euro in principle, a question which can only be truly settled by democratic debate, in the form of the organization of referenda."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, albeit to the displeasure of the extreme right and its allies, the euro is now into the home straight."
"In a few weeks, everything will be in place, and in one year the euro will be the legal currency for more than 200 million Europeans."
"This is the reason why today's debate is very important, and I would like thank and congratulate our rapporteurs for their work and contribution."
"Like Mr Friedrich, I believe that we have to permit a complete integration of the financial markets."
"But I also say that it is necessary to harmonize the tax and legislative framework, and take care that we do not restrict ourselves to giving satisfaction to speculative markets."
"As regards ourselves, which must be a prime concern, we need to favour direct investment, which generates employment, while we need, if not to eliminate, at least to reduce the tax breaks and havens which are in the very heart of our Europe."
"This is one of the conditions of acceptance of the euro by citizens."
"As regards the euro and consumers, I agree with the proposal from Mr Pérez Royo on dual price display, but I would like this to happen as soon as possible, and the system to be introduced in as short as period of time as possible."
"Still on the question of the citizen and the consumer, I support the very firm and very clear demand for home currency to euro conversion to be free of charge to the citizen."
"This requires careful supervision, as we have heard from certain banking quarters that there was a real temptation to make their customers pay for this service."
"With regard to the Ruffolo report, on behalf of the defenders of European industrial competitiveness, which is the dossier on which I am currently working, my sincere wish is that everything be done to avoid an over-valued euro, which would have a negative impact on employment."
"Of course, the politicians will not be fixing parities, but the decisions that we shall be taking may have an effect, whether upwards or downwards, on the exchange rate."
"Furthermore, I am of course in favour of democratic control of the European Central Bank, and hence at the very minimum of control by the Ecofin council on the exchange rate policy."
"Finally, regarding relationships between money and new technologies, which is the subject of Mr Stevens' report, I wish to say that I too wish and hope that this will lead to a reduction in the time required for the minting of coins and printing of banknotes, and hence to the bringing forward of the date of 1 January 2002."
"Three years is really too long."
"Before concluding, I would like to take advantage of these reports to ask Mr de Silguy, who is present, to outline to us his position on the consequences of the Asian crisis, as regards the prospects for growth and the euro timetable."
"Does he not believe that the crisis might bring the timetable forward?"
"Does he still think that we can wait until 1 January 1999 to fix the euro parity, when the euro zone and monetary parities will be fixed on 2 and 3 May?"
"It would be nice, Mr Commissioner, if you could say something here to us all, and not just to the radio and television stations where you feature so frequently."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have already heard a lot of words, and we shall hear a lot more this morning and this afternoon."
"This Parliament's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs and its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have done some excellent work in recent years."
"The insight shown by the chairmen has always made it easy for us to deal with representatives from the financial sector, those with an interest in policy affecting finance and also with associations, including consumer associations, trade associations, and so on."
"The information we have acquired is exemplary by the standards of this Parliament, and the general accessibility of today's debate is important if it is to lead to positive decision-making by the middle of this year."
"I think we can allay people's fears here."
"There is nothing to be gained by frightening people, either by what we say here today or through the attempts of the professors in Germany to frustrate the introduction of the euro."
"What we say and do today must serve to build up trust."
"We have four reports before us."
"The report on the euro and world markets and the Ruffolo report have become highly relevant because of the turmoil in south-east Asia."
"I believe that we must press for a further, more thoroughgoing debate on monetary, interest-rate and subsidy policy in the context of the world economy."
"It is in our hands what we do here in the European Union, and must do because of the Maastricht Treaties, and we do it gladly. Developments in south-east Asia have affected our labour market and competitive situation for years, and trends there in subsidy, low interest and monetary policy have cost a great many jobs."
"We have not paid enough attention to this topic, and now we are deeply involved, as we are having to pump massive amounts of money into those markets - both from Europe and via the IMF - in order to avoid even greater turmoil, if that is possible now."
"Quite a lot has already been said about the Pérez Royo report."
"Werner Langen made it very clear in his speech what consumers want and the respect we should have for their wishes. But he was equally clear - and I am sure Mrs Thyssen will support him in this - about the steps we must take to inform our citizens."
"It is important that with 50 % state participation and the options open to Member States over the next three years, they should make dual pricing clear now."
"I also consider it highly important, as stressed in the Pérez Royo report, that standard quality paper and printing should be used to reassure consumers that there is a minimal risk of counterfeit banknotes."
"This a serious issue on which we can ask for action."
"Mr President, the joint debate on these reports presupposes the citizen to be a Europhile, but to my mind this is not by any means yet the case."
"It is true that the introduction of the euro is the crowning glory of the internal market."
"It is true that with the euro Europe has gained itself an important role on an international plane."
"It is true, competitive relationships will be clarified and the consumer will be able to take advantage of this."
"But the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, rightly pointed out that success as far as the people is concerned depends on the public's perception of the euro, and the wellbeing it adds to their lives."
"What I pick up from discussions with people is that they see the euro primarily as a technocratic measure which politicians, us in other words, want to push down their throats."
"So, Mr President, the issue at the moment is primarily the information of the public."
"The public already finds globalization difficult, as well as loss of identity."
"Proper support of the euro process by the national governments is an absolute must."
"The success of the euro offers the opportunity for very necessary and increased political cooperation within Europe."
"Failure may mean chaos and an end to harmonious common cooperation in several areas."
"In other words we should stick to the criteria, informing the public, and taking them along the euro road, especially those, like myself, who enjoy or will soon enjoy pensions."
"Then I will be able to recommend the euro to our citizens with confidence and enter the twenty-first century as a Europhile, although we might need a euro hotline, as suggested by Mr Gallagher."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will limit myself to the Pérez Royo report."
"My colleagues have already discussed other points, or will do so."
"In his meritorious report Mr Pérez Royo has pointed out various facets related to the euro and the consumer."
"The Commission meanwhile, in its statement on the practical aspects related to the implementation of the euro, has promised to make a number of proposals."
"Commissioner, I quote two important points which still raise questions and have not been given an adequate response, namely dual pricing and the cost of conversion."
"As far as dual pricing is concerned, I would like to know what stage decision-making is at."
"The Commission was to determine before the end of 1997 whether there was a need to introduce a common regulation in all participating countries."
"I agree with those who think that dual pricing must not be imposed in a compulsory fashion."
"Let the market do its work; leave room for flexibility, voluntary agreements, or codes of conduct."
"Mr Commissioner, I have a second question."
"To what extent will the banks charge conversion costs to the customer?"
"On this subject this, too, the Commission promised to determine before the end of 1997 whether either a common regulation or national legislation is desired, or on the other hand whether the issue can be left to market players."
"Could the Commission prohibit charging for possible conversion costs?"
"Our preference would be for the banking sector to formulate a code of conduct itself."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner in advance for his reply."
"Mr President, one of these reports is dedicated to consumers."
"And, despite the justified concerns it reflects, the report does not clarify how consumers will not have to bear the costs."
"It seems right that consumers should not be asked to bear them but, as these costs will exist and will be substantial, who will bear them?"
"It is not enough not to want the consumers to bear them, and to approve resolutions containing this religious statement."
"Nor should we forget that consumers are mainly employees, and in this process it is more important to study the impact on actual wages and on the transparency resulting from better comparability."
"There is a whole problem of credibility and trust that is well equated in the explanation of reasons when the warning is given that people may have the idea that the euro is just for the rich, or that it will only be of use to them, whether at consumer or company level, with the small and medium-sized businesses having greater difficulties with regard to administrative and accounting management and managing the costs of introducing a single currency in several countries."
"On the other hand, no serious thought has yet been given, at least here in Europe, to the consequences of introducing the euro in the countries and regions with monetary areas set up as a result of motherland/colony relationships, even extended to former colonies of other motherlands, as is the case with the CFA area and Guinea-Bissau."
"One final point: we are late in devising an offsetting mechanism that could deal with disproportionate shocks, necessarily different from those created by the IMF, which has consequences worldwide and is usually unaware of the causes and makes them worse."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the introduction of our new single currency calls for optimal accompanying monetary-policy measures. We must also bear in mind the impact on the capital markets of all the relevant parameters, and make due allowance for the effect of the external aspects of economic and monetary union."
"But in addition, and most importantly, we must make the euro as acceptable as possible to the people of Europe."
"The euro will be all the more acceptable if it can be made obvious how it is going to function. In this respect it is particularly important to ensure in the capital market that profit distribution and repayments - in the case of pension funds for example - are subject to workable investment principles."
"We also need to take account of the competition principle, according to which a major part of funds has to remain inland, in the European Union - I am thinking of the Friedrich report now - and all the more so right now, because investment in the European Union is more important than ever, if we are to get a grip on our employment situation."
"That is a priority."
"Quite simply, that is how the euro and the future of our money economy will be judged."
"The money economy cannot just be something abstract."
"Furthermore, the consumer policy aspects are also highly important."
"The introduction of the euro should not cost consumers anything during the transitional phase."
"Conversion costs - in both senses of the word - should not be charged to consumers."
"The continuity of existing contracts must be guaranteed, and accompanying measures are needed for this purpose."
"One of the key accompanying measures is dual pricing."
"Dual pricing also requires a legal framework, a regulation."
"This kind of regulation is necessary to provide consumers with transparency and means of checking."
"It is not a question of not being able to trust the market, it is a question of getting consumers to trust the euro, and the force of law has a part to play here too."
"We also need to encourage people to feel good about the single currency."
"This will provide credibility and will also contribute to the reputation that our institutions, particularly the European Central Bank, need to have."
"If stability is to be achieved, it will require many accompanying measures, but above all enormous sensitivity."
"That is the essence of the political challenge."
"It cannot just be left to the money technocrats!"
"Mr President, a very important debate is being held this morning that highlights the active role played by the European Parliament in this stage of development of the final, definitive stage of economic and monetary union."
"I would like to raise a few points, which to a certain extent relate to the excellent reports presented by Mr Friedrich on the capital markets and Mr Ruffolo on the external role of the euro."
"I want to start with a question: is it enough to establish the objective of stability as the fundamental mission at the basis of the independence of the future European Central Bank, to insist on the requirements of accountability to have a good system of governing the European economy?"
"There is no doubt that monetary policy interacts with the rest of economic policy and is conditioned by it: it interacts in particular with fiscal policy, budgetary policy, tax policy, with what we can call the non-monetary government of the economy."
"And so the basic subject we have before us is that of the future system of economic governance for the European Union in economic and monetary union."
"I believe that the decisions taken at the recent Luxembourg Summit, generally in favour of the formation of the socalled Eurocouncil, are going in the right direction and summarize the requirement for a non-monetary government authority for the economy, which to a certain extent matches the monetary government of the European Central Bank."
"This will be a system based on two independent economic-policy authorities, which are inevitably interconnected in the link that exists within the economic policy in general in a system such as the European one."
"Not only that, they will be two authorities with the same dignity and authority that have to establish the need, particularly for the Eurocouncil, to speed up the solution to several basic issues presented. Economic and monetary union consists of two essential sides, like a medal: the monetary side and the non-monetary side."
"Within the latter, I will point out the subjects relating to the internal market, the need to speed up the implementation of the so-called action plan, and the tax subjects."
"From this point of view, the decisions taken by the Ecofin Council on 1 December are very encouraging and I think the European Parliament will have the opportunity to come back to these and stimulate further progress."
"To conclude, I would just like to mention one aspect that interacts with the point raised by Mr Friedrich, that is the agreement on a directive on the taxation of financial income for non-resident natural persons, a subject of fundamental importance to enable the future capital market to operate appropriately in the presence of the euro."
"Mr President, I welcome the main thrust of the Pérez Royo report because it recognizes that real and tangible measures must be implemented to protect consumer interests in the run-up to the introduction of the single European currency."
"May I say from an Irish perspective that we do not want to see the errors which arose when decimalization was introduced in the early 1970s and when there was vast confusion all over the place."
"While I recognize that the actual euro notes and coins will not be put into the pockets of the 340 million consumers until the year 2002, time is still of the essence with regard to the European-funded information campaigns which need to be orchestrated in this regard."
"In advance of the date of 2002 many banking and commercial transactions can be carried out using the euro denomination."
"The European Commission, together with the national governments, must fund information campaigns relating specifically to the pricing of products in both the euro and the currency of the host Member State in the run-up to EMU."
"Dual-pricing campaigns must be part of this process, and such campaigns must take place in all key supermarkets and shopping outlets across Europe."
"Finally, the prices of products should be displayed with the price denominated in euros and in the national currency."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the external aspects of economic and monetary union are often overlooked in the discussions on the euro."
"Wrongly, because the external implications of EMU will have important consequences for both the EU and for our direct partners, as well as for the entire web of international economic monetary relationships."
"The euro will undeniably play an important part as an international currency, and will create more balance within the international monetary system, especially in relation to the dollar."
"EMU will enable the EU better to offer resistance against external shocks such as the ones caused by speculative capital flows."
"EMU means an important step towards a new and more balanced international monetary system, from a unipolar to a multipolar system, in which the European Union will be able to play a leading role, and, it is to be hoped, will actually do so."
"EMU will give the European Union a greater responsibility within the international financial economic organizations."
"Concrete interpretation of this, within the IMF and the G7 amongst others, is therefore urgently required."
"Finally, I would like to point out the danger of wishing to regulate and frame too much in advance of the start of the third phase of EMU."
"In particular the market, influenced by a convincing and effective macro-economic policy, must determine the rate of the euro, rather than our advance management of it - a rate which has a positive reverberation in the outside world as well as on Europe's economic position and its global, economic and monetary cooperation and stability."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago the political will for this ambitious project of the euro came into being."
"During the past years economic convergence has improved rather spectacularly, despite sometimes difficult conjunctural effects."
"Today we are on the eve of a transitional period which may be important and of great significance for the credibility of the new European currency."
"For the present, the ball will soon be in the court of the national governments."
"They will give the new currency more credibility by not only issuing new loans in euros, but by converting the outstanding national debts as much as possible into the euro."
"Secondly, the euro will offer an answer to several countries who would like to differentiate reserves more."
"I am not saying that the euro will take the place of the dollar, but I am saying that the euro may become an important factor of diversification."
"Thirdly, it is clear that the sum of the reserves of the participating countries is greater than the sum necessary to support the European currency."
"I therefore support Mr Ruffolo's request that the European Commission should look into how these surplus reserves might be best used."
"Fourthly, during the transitional phase everything has be to be done to inform the public."
"The time of uncertainty will be over once 2 May has passed."
"We must direct all resources, all budgetary resources that we have for information, towards informing the public about the introduction of the euro."
"Fifthly, an important role awaits banking, which in the recent past has proved in my country, too, not to have earned any trust in its behaviour towards the customer."
"I therefore do not rely on market forces, as Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens and Mr De Clercq just said."
"I think that the European Commission and, if necessary, the national Member States must make legal provisions and guarantee free conversion of national currency into the euro."
"Lastly, the introduction of the euro offers new opportunities and perspectives in a broader sphere."
"Let us try today to make a start on European coordination, as agreed on 1 December. Let us use this beginning of economic coordination to map out one route which may incur the risk of the disadvantages and consequences of the crisisridden Asian markets today."
"This is the first test case, as far as I am concerned, for better economic coordination which has to be linked to the introduction of the euro."
"Mr President, the smaller the amount, the higher the costs are."
"This summer I was on holiday with my daughter in Italy, and she changed 100 schillings in a money-changing machine."
"It gave her 9, 600 lire."
"When we got back to Austria, I gave her back the money, rounded up to 10, 000 lire."
"Commissioner, just guess how much money she got from the Austrian machine - she got exactly half, just 50 %!"
"I think this sort of thing costs a lot of money in tourism and in other areas."
"When you consider that we have about 50 % more bank employees than in America, and at higher staff costs at that, and that all this is partly necessary to grapple with the whole area of foreign currency exchange and risk, then we will certainly have to keep an eye on our banks in Europe and consider what banking supervision arrangements we shall need in future."
"The fact that the banking system has been one of the main reasons for the crisis in the ASEAN states means that we need to be particularly attentive about a healthy banking system in Europe when we switch to the euro."
"At the end of the day, the larger the amounts are, the greater the risk, and I believe that one of our chief tasks should be to limit that risk."
"If you consider that between 1985 and 1995 the dollar led to the loss of some 1.3 million jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research, then you will appreciate just how important a single currency is for us."
"As for the strength of the euro, I have to say that it is perhaps stronger than many exporters would like."
"Mr President, I will focus on Mr Friedrich's report, and on behalf of my group I can say that we agree with Mr Friedrich that it is conceivable that, once the euro has come into being, Europe will have the second largest bond market in the world. So there are opportunities for Europe in this field."
"But it is not enough to observe and note this."
"Particularly in the area of condition-creating policy, the Union will still have to initiate a great deal, for example, in the sphere of company law, regulations for accounting, and stock market rules."
"It is truly scandalous, and I have said so before in this Chamber, that we still have not managed to bring about a statute for businesses."
"Enormous effort has also been made by the Davignon Committee, and yet it continues to drag."
"Finally, I, like Mr Friedrich, would like to call for attention to be paid to pension funds in the various Member States."
"As a result of existing obligations whereby they have to invest the largest part in the country of residence, opportunities are missed."
"I will personally call for attention for this point in my report to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Green Paper on pensions."
"But here, too, I believe the European Commission will have to take action to make the Member States see that they can no longer hang on to outdated policy on this front."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro must be strong and dependable."
"Confidence of the markets is not enough."
"We need the confidence of the people."
"That means better democracy and monitoring of the Central Bank, which is responsible to the democratically-elected bodies."
"Major companies in Finland will be switching to the euro at the start of the third stage."
"Already 64 % of the larger Finnish concerns have said they are getting prepared for the switch."
"But the situation is more problematic for small companies."
"Only 7 % have begun preparations."
"And the situation is even less promising in the service sector."
"The SME sector is Europe's most important employer."
"The SMEs, however, do not have the resources to create new information systems nor always the staff skills or money to acquire them."
"The Commission should therefore produce an advice pack for them."
"In order that the costs of transition do not overburden the taxpayer, the introduction of the euro must not mean consumers having to pay for it."
"The euro may be the project of the century, but it seems to be making a very sleepy entry among Member States."
"Education and information on the euro is absolutely essential for ordinary people, and it has come late in many areas."
"Confusing and inadequate information has led to an image of much dithering and secrecy, and in times of mass unemployment this has increased opposition to it."
"Memories of massive postWar devaluation lead us to regard money seriously."
"It is more valuable the less there is of it."
"That is why the information on the new money must be solid and comprehensive."
"I suggest that every Member State has a popular-style series of programmes on television, to follow on from the news, showing the latest on the euro."
"It cannot be possible that the appeal of a common currency is harder to get across than the absorption rate of babies' nappies."
"I agree with Mr Pérez Royo that the electricity, gas, water and telephone companies must get involved by stating their customers' bills in euros as well as local currency."
"We cannot, however, suppose that commercial companies, for example, - and I do not mean supermarkets - would be able to train up staff members as experts on the euro, as has been hinted at here."
"That is the duty of the government, and it is obviously ours too."
"Mr President, the introduction of the euro will obviously bring about change for all market players, and we are convinced that the positive effects will amply outstrip the negative ones."
"We should not worry too much about the positive effects, but we should explain them to the public."
"A great deal still needs to happen on that front."
"As far as the inconveniences are concerned, we have to make sure that they remain as few as possible, even if they are principally a transition issue."
"In order to succeed, we have to inform the public, but we also have to realize that information is indeed necessary, but not enough. We must realize that we need a legal and balanced framework, a framework which ensures that notes are not counterfeited; that conversions take place at the right rate, and according to the right method of calculation."
"We have to make sure that the introduction of the euro does not affect the continuity of contracts, that the period of concurrence of charter money in different denominations is as brief as possible, and that information is given in such a way that the consumer knows there are reasons to be confident."
"Most of the issues, Mr President, are arranged by law, but unfortunately, not optimally."
"My group is convinced that accession contracts should not deviate from the continuity principle."
"We have therefore submitted an amendment in which we ask the Commission to submit a proposal to amend Regulation 1103."
"I would be interested to know if the Commissioner is prepared to consider an initiative to this effect."
"Then there is the issue of dual pricing."
"The polarization of the interests of the consumer on the one hand, and retail trade on the other, is in our opinion not realistic."
"These interests run much more parallel than some people would have us believe."
"It is out of this philosophy that we have submitted Amendment No 8, an amendment in which we ask to wait and see for a bit - wait and see until after 1999 to see what the markets will do spontaneously."
"Then, on the basis of actual reactions from the market players, we will be able to determine what is needed, whether we need detailed regulation for dual pricing, and if so, how we can make these fit the realistic needs of all the players."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for several excellent reports with regard to the introduction of the euro."
"Indeed, the euro is coming."
"It heralds a new era and it certainly is the biggest economic project the world has ever seen."
"For this reason clearly its success is extremely important."
"All of the reports have one common theme. The theme is that it will greatly benefit the users, whether these users are consumers, businesses or simply those involved in the operation of currencies in the international financial markets."
"Mr Stevens' report in particular looks at the introduction of new technology and offers one solution in the form of electronic money."
"This will make it easy for people to be able to move around the European Union with electronic cash and this enhances one of the principles of the Treaty with regard to free movement, in particular labour mobility."
"It will provide for safe and secure cash and it will also aid industries such as the tourism industry, which is one of the fastest growing industries in the European Union."
"It is a major piece in the economic jigsaw and will unite Europe as never before."
"It will improve the operation of the single market and stabilize the EU economy, particularly where there is turbulence in the global financial markets."
"It will also foster an era of new economic cooperation and I would like to see introduced, along with this, the concept of democratic accountability."
"I agree with my colleagues who have talked about the introduction of a banking committee, because we need a dialogue with the European Central Bank, we need surveillance and close monitoring of the European Central Bank, and we need the European Central Bank to be accountable, so that Parliament can offer advice."
"But I, along with my colleagues, believe that we must never compromise the independence of the Central Bank, otherwise the financial markets will turn on the euro."
"We have a huge opportunity, and a huge prize is on offer."
"Let us take that opportunity and take Europe into the twenty-first century and bring prosperity to the European Community."
"Mr President, we have heard four very interesting reports on a subject of fundamental importance."
"The future credibility of Europe will be staked on the euro and the arrival of the single currency."
"The single currency is both a means and an end to make the citizens understand that they form part of a community in which they can travel, buy, move and so on, thanks to the single currency."
"The rapporteurs have to face practical problems, and we thank them for their speeches."
"There are other problems which have not yet emerged and which the single currency will inevitably clarify better in the next few months, if not in the next few weeks."
"The euro is a peaceful end-of-century revolution; it is an essential condition for providing a uniform and collective economic system which the European Union has to use as a great means of making its function understood."
"There are practical problems obviously connected with the functioning of the relationship between those circulating the euro and the final user, who is the citizen, particularly as consumer."
"It has been recalled by other colleagues that it will be in the banks that the citizens will discover the euro, but particularly in the commercial distribution system. It will be in the shops, supermarkets, restaurants and travel agencies that he will encounter the euro, and he will have to have a commercial contact there - a small businessman, an assistant - prepared to explain, and enable him to understand how the euro operates."
"And so we will have to work together to provide information for the consumer and training for business."
"In the same way, we should not make the citizens bear any bank charges in switching from national currency to European single currency."
"Finally, we would like to recall several aspects that are connected with the operation of the single currency."
"It is in the commercial system that the euro will be most widely circulated and known by the citizen as a consumer. Business will have to deal with the requests for information on this great monetary innovation in brief, clear, concise terms."
"We should therefore enable the small or large trader to provide clear answers, otherwise the cost of introducing the euro will end up becoming disruptive for all parts of the economic system: industry, production and consumer."
"What we want to avoid - and indeed must avoid - is that the final cost of introducing the single currency should fall on the consumer alone."
"Commissioner, I would just like to emphasize again that in the course of this debate all the speakers who have called for dual pricing in the interests of consumer protection have in no way been suggesting that the interests of consumers and the interests of small and medium-sized companies and individual retailers should be played off against each other."
"Although we consider it fundamentally important that practical and inexpensive arrangements should be put in place with a minimum of red tape, the Commission also has a duty to protect consumers."
"Mr President, I asked the Commissioner a very specific question, and I do not believe I received a reply."
"I asked specifically whether the Commissioner is prepared to take an initiative to amend Regulation 1103 of 11 June 1997."
"This regulation makes a number of provisions on the introduction of the euro."
"It establishes the principle of continuity, but it does leave space for accession contracts which deviate from this principle, for accession contracts which affect continuity."
"We have problems with this."
"We submitted an amendment to this effect."
"Parliament requests that this regulation is amended, and I would be grateful if the Commissioner could tell me if he is prepared to take an initiative in this direction."
"I think it is absolutely vital if we want to keep or win the customer's trust."
"Mr President, I have taken good note of Mrs Randzio-Plath's comment."
"I am in agreement with her on the objective and, I hope, on the means to achieve it."
"I would like to respond to Mrs Thyssen."
"I believe that today we need to realize that, firstly, the regulations on the legal status of the euro - adopted unanimously - are in my opinion beyond all amendment, as there would be no unanimous position within the Council for any amendment."
"Secondly, I note that there is convergence of opinion from all quarters regarding the satisfactory nature of the regulations, and on the necessary guarantees they offer in terms of continuity of contract."
"Thirdly, Mrs Thyssen, if this raises a problem with regard to unlawful contractual clauses, I believe I have said that I am ready to look into a modification, or an adaptation of the consumer protection directives, in such a way as to ensure the transparency of contracts, and the prohibition of unlawful clauses contained in them."
"If you have practical problems, do not hesitate to lay them before us in writing."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Votes"
"Madam President, I have to say that concerning paragraph 17, the Greek translation contains certain errors which I would ask the Parliamentary services to correct."
"The same is true for paragraph 31."
"The Greek translation of the text must be corrected."
"Consequently paragraph 17 and paragraph 31 require a corrigendum as regards the Greek translation."
"I would also like to make an oral amendment to Article 33 to correct an error there: in paragraph 33 the text that the Members of this House have says: ""I remind you that the aforementioned joint agreements between rail companies 'must contain provisions'...' ."
"Now the text says ""must contain provisions..' , which totally changes the sense of this sentence."
"I therefore propose orally that paragraph 33 be amended by adding the word not ."
"In English it is ""must contain' while it should be ""must not contain...' ."
"Mr Sarlis, we have all understood, and in all languages."
"Simply, when you say to us that it is just a question of adding a negation, everybody is fully aware of the fact that this totally changes the way we are going to vote."
"I would like to know, and Mr Wijsenbeek will certainly enlighten us on this point, whether this is a correction, that is to say, whether what should be submitted to the vote does effectively include the negation, and that therefore the text that we have has no negation simply as a result of an error, or if this is an oral amendment, the aim of which is to introduce the negation, in which case the oral amendment is a very substantial one."
"I am in total agreement with the rapporteur."
"Are there any objections to taking into consideration the oral amendment of Mr Sarlis, supported by Mr Wijsenbeek?"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"The report embraces the deregulation and liberalization of access to the railway infrastructure."
"There is no way that we can support the political line which the report depicts."
"Deregulation would adversely affect employment, reduce efficiency, damage 'public service' interests, destroy a supportive division of costs between rural and city consumers, and adversely affect the legal employment position of the personnel concerned."
"As Social Democrats, it is totally impossible for us to support such a political alignment of society."
"Railway transport is a social service where the profit motive should not be everything."
"With its White Paper on the revitalization of the railways, the European Commission is returning to a philosophy which is dear to its heart: only immediate and unconditional liberalization will ensure the viability of the rail sector."
"We cannot subscribe to such an analysis."
"Competition must not be an absolute criterion, or an end in itself."
"At the time of the publication of the White Paper, very strong reactions were heard in condemnation of the determined pursuit of free-market objectives by the Commission."
"In my view, the report which is submitted to us for our scrutiny has not taken legitimate measure of the concerns of professionals in the rail industry."
"This report recommends liberalization by stages - as has been done in the air sector."
"However, this approach is not appropriate."
"By forcing the pace of liberalization - even if it is staged - there is a risk of damaging the rail sector rather than revitalizing it."
"The Commission must - in collaboration with the interested parties - undertake an assessment of the application of the basic directive before envisaging its modification along more free-market lines."
"Finally, I am concerned at the absence of provisions relating to the social and labour relations dimension."
"In ten years, the sector has lost 500, 000 jobs."
"To accept the principle of liberalization, as set out in this report, would only increase job losses."
"For all these reasons, I can only condemn this report."
"The report by our colleague Pavlos Sarlis is a serious one, but I can absolutely not subscribe to the proposals that he is submitting to us today."
"Indeed, I do not believe that the future of rail transport requires increased liberalization."
"The example of Great Britain in this field shows us the hard and stark reality of liberalization for passengers, in which the only objective of the private companies is profitability, at the expense of a universal service reduced to the purely notional, and which will be completely sidelined."
"Creating a European network of railways by liberalizing them is in practice to take them just a little bit further away from the less favoured regions, whose lines are not very profitable, and 'breaking up' what little remains of proper town and country planning."
"A network is only properly European if its branches stretch out across the whole of Europe, and not simply into the rich and profitable areas."
"If we do not go in the direction of an extensive and widely accessible service, we shall be condemning rail transport."
"How can we imagine that private companies could commit the colossal amounts of investment which appear necessary for the future high-speed networks without passing on the cost to the users, and without eliminating the lines which are in book-keeping terms less profitable."
"Finally, while I cannot vote for the report in its current state, I ardently desire the introduction into it of the obligation of service to all regions of the European Union, and for the respect of national special features and statutes, so that the railways become a true public service, enabling the all-round improvement of the environment, by reducing the preponderance of road transport."
"As a French socialist, I cannot vote for the Sarlis report, just as I cannot approve the European Commission's proposal."
"Indeed, we grant an essential priority to the development of the railways, particularly for social and ecological reasons, and for reasons of planned use of space."
"That being the case, how can immediate or even staged liberalization be accepted, which would inevitably bring with it its load of redundancies and exclusion?"
"This is a purely economic vision, which absolutely fails to take into account the human dimension, and in this respect I cannot accept it."
"The SNCF is just beginning to climb out of the abyss, and this is certainly no time to push it back down again."
"Can we still take the risk of increasing the unemployment figures in Europe?"
"I am raising the question, but in my view the reply is clearly ""no' ."
"The report raises several important structural issues relating to railways and transport as a whole within the EU."
"It is quite clear that railways must be expanded and improved to be able to meet competition."
"There is everything to gain by increasing rail transport in EU countries, in terms of both freight transport and passenger transport."
"On the other hand, I do not think deregulating the market is the best solution to the current problems of rail transport."
"Instead I believe that people should put some concrete action into all the empty words about favouring the railways which we are always hearing from the Commission and the Council. Turn these empty words into action by, among other things, greatly increasing financial support so that railways get as much financial support as roads, and by letting road transport pay for all its costs - including environmental costs - as we in the Green Group have previously proposed."
"Railways are a superior form of transport when you want minimal environmental impact, particularly where freight transport is concerned, and the cost of the railways today would be easily recovered if you included what it costs to restore the environment after all the pollution from road traffic."
"Despite the alarming loss of jobs on the European railways (around 500, 000 in ten years, one third of total employment in the sector); despite the fundamental role this means of transport may play in the preservation of the environment; despite the loss of importance of the railways, with the increase in options available, with the increase in unfair competition from road transportation and with the lack of investments, at national and Community level, that have made it impossible to improve or renovate infrastructures, that have disregarded management adaptations to the new requirements and allowed the quality of services rendered to decline deliberately; despite indicating the situation and some of these causes, the Commission wants the ""strategy to revitalize the European railways' to study and speed up the privatization and liberalization of the sector."
"The Commission does not propose to attack the causes, nor is it thinking of proposing any alternatives."
"It is not paying attention to the social consequences of the direction it wishes to take, although it admits that unemployment will get worse."
"It is basing its strategy on the enthusiastic support given by the great patronage of the sector, eager for the enormous profits in sight, broadened with the prospect of the Union's expansion eastwards."
"It is advocating the immediate amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC, refusing to make the balance, to permit not only an accounting separation between the management of the infrastructures and the management of the transport, but also a legal separation speeding up the privatization of transport operation - the profitable sections of the current railway companies."
"It does not wish to reflect on recent experiences of privatization of the railways (in Thatcherite England) where, along with unemployment, no improvements in quality have been recorded and public services have got worse despite the fact that the private companies have received subsidies for their respective implementation."
"The Sarlis report, in turn, limits itself to supporting the strategy of the White Paper."
"It does not study or propose alternatives that might pass through an increase in public investment at all levels, an increase in cooperation from the national companies in the establishment and operation of high-speed passes and in an improvement in the quality of the supply."
"The Sarlis report limits itself to introducing phasing into the Commission's privatization strategy and advocating further social measures to reduce the disastrous consequences on employment."
"In this context, we can only vote against the report and reject the strategy proposed by the Commission, hoping that it will not be approved by Council."
"It is satisfying to note that the corresponding committee has succeeded in reaching a sensible and balanced line on the Commission's White Paper on a strategy for an efficient and modern railway system."
"It is gratifying that Parliament and the Commission are already united from the outset in wanting to ensure the survival of the railways."
"The railways are now on the verge of losing the fight against cars, lorries and buses."
"But Europe cannot afford to lose rail as a means of transport, out of consideration for the environment and because of the increased freight transport between the EU, eastern Europe and central Asia."
"First, I would like to congratulate Mr Sarlis for his report."
"He has put his finger on a number of problems which should prompt reflection by all interested parties."
"It is important to push on with the railways policy inside the European Community, and well beyond."
"It is absolutely necessary to accelerate rail transport if it is wished to develop it as a means of transportation."
"For this reason, there are 'freight corridors' , and I am delighted that, for once, some of the European railways have been able to get ahead of the political world, by creating 'freight corridors' ."
"As we now discuss this report by Mr Sarlis, some of these 'freight corridors' are already operating between Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Italy, with extensions towards Spain, and it should be pointed out that a similar agreement between Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden has been signed."
"It should come into force in a few months."
"This new approach of collaboration between railways presages well, and I would like to congratulate the managers for their courage."
"I hope they will receive the support of governments and also the trade unions."
"I continue to believe that the White Paper on the revitalization of the railways recommends a liberalization which I cannot accept."
"When you read that since 1985, 500, 000 jobs have been lost in the railways, and that the intention is to eliminate still more jobs, I think we have reached a point where the railways, till now a very dependable means of transportation, see their safety put at risk."
"On the other hand, I regret that the Commission has limited itself to a sketchy outline of the repercussions of restructuring."
"I even believe that the Commission considers these repercussions as a lesser evil, when compared to the possible alternative of continued deterioration in the sector."
"Consequently, the Commission passes over in silence the fact that the repercussions risk being very different in the various Member States, as liberalization benefits companies working in environments where the social benefits of the workforce are curtailed."
"The result will be a substantial flight of rail business away from the countries where the levels of social and worker protection are high."
"I therefore believe that the Commission should provide for support actions for liberalization in the EU rail sector, with bottom-up harmonization of conditions of competition, and in particular of social and labour conditions."
"In spite of these comments, I shall vote in favour of Mr Sarlis' report."
"Mr President, I am supporting this report today as it can help our railways survive and prosper into the future."
"This is vital not only for those who work in the rail sector, but also as part of our efforts to move freight traffic from our congested roads onto more environmentally friendly rail."
"The report strikes a sensible and fair balance between granting free access to railways for companies operating international freight business, and ensuring decent working conditions and training for staff."
"The report is also right to call for equal VAT treatment for all forms of transport, so that rail gets a fair chance to compete for transport business."
"In future we should also ensure that there are connections between the various freight freeways so that a genuine network for international freight can be created."
"Our economy, our environment and the jobs of our railway and transport workers can all benefit if we act now to ensure the viability of rail freight business."
"Desama Report (A4-0384/97)"
"I would like once again to congratulate our colleague Claude Desama for the quality and readability of his report, for the pertinence of his analysis and for the interest of his proposals."
"There is no doubt that we are at a turning point in space activities, and hence for our European space industries."
"From a pioneering epoch we have now moved straight on into an era of commercial warfare, where the strategies deployed offer financial risks associated with opportunities for profit in equal number."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that increased synergy between the various players in the space industry is imperative."
"Faced with American and - in the longer term - Asian competition, it is important that we move towards greater concentration in order to maximize the enormous investment required for research and development in this sector."
"It is also important not to reduce public funding of research, but rather to increase it."
"The future depends on our political will."
"I share the declared determination of Claude Desama to include in his report the necessary environmental dimension of space technologies, both in terms of prevention of natural disasters, and in terms of cleaning up space debris."
"In this field, the awareness which came to the fore at the Kyoto summit has attracted a great deal of attention, and it now behoves the European Union to take the lead, both in competitiveness and in environmental terms."
"The generations to come cannot but be grateful."
"Space and associated fields can make a useful contribution."
"The European Union, in space as in other fields, must go in the direction of renewal and modernity."
"To go forward, we must be able to anticipate."
"It is important that, right now, the proposals put forward by Claude Desama should be rapidly put into practice."
"Space projects should not be carried out if they require the use of nuclear material, if they could involve effects on the climate through the destruction of the ozone layer or problems with waste products in space."
"Friedrich Report(A4-0383/97)"
"Sweden has decided not to join EMU, even though it qualifies for membership."
"This is a decision which we support."
"The single currency project is an immense gamble being made with the employment, social security and welfare of the citizens as the stake."
"The Commission communication on the impact of the introduction of the euro on the capital markets, like the European Parliament's Friedrich report, is somewhat disappointing, as it deals with this vast subject from a rather over-simplifying technical angle."
"No-one doubts that there will be problems 'redenominating' debt in euro, in ensuring the continuity of benchmark indices, in harmonizing market conventions and in altering the values of securities. But there is no doubt either that the technicians will be able to solve these problems."
"We would have wished that the documents submitted to us today contained a wider vision of the impact of the introduction of the euro on the capital markets."
"It is clear that if the single currency is introduced on schedule, the work of the professionals in the financial industry and in the operation of the capital markets, and the centre of gravity of the financial marketplaces, and the European financial landscape itself, will all be changed."
"Of course, this will not mark year one in a new era of the European management of savers' investment portfolios, as some pretend."
"For many years now investors have been diversifying their investments, and OPCVM mutual funds have ensured that diversification is within the grasp of each individual."
"Many owners of investment portfolios, even on a limited scale, now own European SICAV mutual funds."
"What is true, on the other hand, is that the introduction of a single currency can be a spur to financial innovation, and make diversification a little easier, by eliminating exchange risks and providing an incentive to the levelling down of legal and tax differences between markers."
"For this reason, I was expecting the European Parliament's report to contain, as in the past, glowing demonstrations of the ability of a wider and more liquid capital market to reduce the cost of borrowing, for example."
"No such thing!"
"If we try to adopt an even broader viewpoint, we are forced to the conclusion that the financial innovations and economies of scale in the management of the capital markets, after the introduction of the euro, will be of little interest if, at the same time, the economy falls to pieces."
"That is the real question."
"We need to guard against the illusions fostered by the technicians, as reflected in the Commission communication and Parliament's report."
"When all is said and done, monetary union will make us more losers, in terms of new rigidities and economic turbulence, than we are gainers, as a result of technical simplification."
"From today's report and the subsequent debate it is clear that engineers and economists are working flat out to solve the practical problems caused by the structure of EMU."
"This is in spite of the fact that the idea of a single currency is unwanted and very abstract for the people of Europe who are instead concerned about social welfare and the possibility of establishing an environmentally sustainable society."
"The only right thing to do would be to immediately stop the process and instead initiate an in-depth debate with the citizens."
"Changing to a single currency is an issue of such magnitude that it should definitely be the subject of a referendum."
"Because the above-mentioned reports concern the - in our opinion - mistaken introduction of a single currency, we cannot vote for them."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that we share the view of the Swedish economist who compared watching the introduction of the single currency with standing on the quay and watching the Titanic sail off into the distance to its fate."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the report by Mr Friedrich concerning the impact of the introduction of the euro on Europe's capital markets."
"When EMU is implemented it will create the third largest stock market after the USA and Japan, which will therefore be a very attractive market for investors both inside and outside the EMU area."
"The report mentions that there will be a flourishing share culture as a result of the euro."
"The Danish Social Democrats are able to support the report, but point out that Denmark is not taking part in the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"Economic and monetary union is a high-risk project."
"The EU is not an optimal currency area, and the economies of the different Member States are far too different to be able to implement a single currency."
"The single currency is also more of a political project than an economic one, leading to increased centralization in the direction of an 'EU State' ."
"There is also a high risk that EMU, with its one-sided preoccupation with fighting inflation, will lead to increased unemployment and increased regional imbalances."
"In the accompanying resolution, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has said no to participation in EMU."
"Against that background, I have abstained or voted against the four reports on the euro."
"Ruffolo Report (A4-0338/97)"
"Madam President, I wish to speak more generally on the problem of the euro at a time when, in a world market, the currency will be regional, and even so not completely regional, as Great Britain at least will not be participating."
"In other words, we will be dealing with continental currency, a sort of monetary Anschluß, and I would remind you that, in the case of the Anschluß, there was at least a referendum."
"Currency is rather like Buddhism, it is a small vehicle for the transmission of information."
"In this particular case, the euro will be a vehicle for conveying information for a society of 17 million unemployed people, 50 million impoverished people, on an ageing continent which is subservient to the United States. Just look at the World Trade Organization."
"How will the euro change the position of the European Union in the world commercial negotiations of the year 2000?"
"Basically, Mr de Silguy is a little bit like the Africans: he confuses the symbol and the symbolized."
"If you are a consumer of powdered rhinoceros horn, your virility is not thereby improved."
"The symbol may be heightened, but not that which is symbolized."
"The euro, at root, may in hormonal and media terms prompt a degree of fantasticism. But in economic reality, nothing will change."
"It is interesting to note that this report reinforces our argument in Sweden against joining EMU."
"Economic and monetary union is going to lead to increased demand for a more common financial and tax policy."
"In paragraph N the report raises the need for a coordination of tax policies, and in paragraph 8 it talks about the harmonization of tax obligations."
"We are convinced that a coordination of the common financial and tax policy would result in the Scandinavian model of universal welfare losing out to the Christian Democrat policy of a low tax burden to provide a 'freedom of choice' which is only going to benefit the well-off in society."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report by Mr Ruffolo concerning the external aspects of economic and monetary union."
"The report points out the desirability of conducting a monetary policy which moderates long-term interest rates without weakening the demand for price stability."
"The rapporteur has stressed that the value of the euro against the currencies of third countries shall correspond to the real intrinsic value."
"The Danish Social Democrats support this report, but point out that Denmark is not taking part in the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"Stevens Report (A4-0417/97)"
"Madam President, the Stevens report draws our attention to the twin revolution facing the European financial environment in the years ahead."
"One of these revolutions, under the control of the authorities, is likely to be the single currency."
"The other, and spontaneous, revolution is electronic money."
"This second revolution, a private enterprise initiative, could rapidly gather pace if it were given an appropriate regulatory framework, as the services it will render in everyday life are great."
"A single chip card can make everyday payments in several currencies, and provide a number of other functions."
"In fact, however, the two revolutions are, in the eyes of the European authorities, far too ambitious an undertaking if pursued simultaneously."
"It was too risky, as they saw it, to fundamentally change citizens' habits, and make so many demands on people as to provoke rejection."
"The authorities therefore preferred to concentrate all efforts on the single currency, even at the expense of a delay in the introduction of electronic money."
"This choice appears to be highly regrettable, as the developed countries are at present locked into ferocious competition for leadership in this market."
"Europe has a great deal going for it."
"It is even at the cutting edge of smart card technology."
"But in the absence of mobilization by the authorities, we risk being overtaken by the Americans."
"There is worse to come."
"If we had encouraged the development of electronic money, we would have realized that it provides an answer to the many questions that the single currency is intended to solve, notably problems of foreign exchange for people travelling from country to country."
"While eliminating the practical difficulties of handling many currencies, including currencies well beyond the euro zone, the electronic purse would ensure the continuing flexibility of national exchange rates, which in our view is indispensable if our economies are to adjust flexibly, which is precisely what the euro is intended to prevent."
"Hence, the single-currency mistake may well delay the revolution in electronic money in Europe, for the sake of a single currency which will, with hindsight, be seen for the illusion it is."
"Since Sweden is not going to participate in the introduction of EMU, we have decided to abstain from voting on this report."
"The introduction of the euro will greatly benefit consumers, leading to greater competition and ultimately lower prices for goods and services."
"It will also obviate the need for currency transactions and costs."
"Greater efficiency in financial transactions will also be inevitable."
"As a consequence, the single currency provides an ideal opportunity for the greater use of electronic transactions and smart cards."
"I therefore welcome Mr Stevens' report as a useful contribution as to how a proper regulatory framework can be established to ensure a smooth transfer for the introduction of electronic money on a Europeanwide basis."
"However, it should be acknowledged that despite the benefits of the single currency, some consumers are considerably apprehensive."
"The one way to assuage these fears is to ensure in relation to the use of electronic money that the most stringent safeguards exist to prevent fraud and abuse of privacy."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for John Steven's report concerning electronic money in the countries which take part in the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"The report deals with the problem of who should have permission to issue payment cards with electronic money within the EMU area."
"The view in the report is that institutions other than banks should be able to issue these payment cards, which shall, however, be done according to specific rules which the Commission is being asked to draw up."
"The report stresses that the European Central Bank together with the competent authorities should keep a close watch on the electronic money market in Europe."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree with the above points of view, but point out that Denmark is outside the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"Pérez Royo Report (A4-0415/97)"
"This report does not mention the great risks consumers are being exposed to by a single currency in an area which is not optimal."
"Nor does the report mention the high conversion costs which the introduction of a new currency involves with regard to the conversion of vending machines, computer systems etc."
"It is clear that it is the consumers, the citizens, who will have to pay for all this in the form of higher prices and taxes."
"The Pérez Royo report presents the consumers with a balance sheet of the costs and benefits of the euro, but is short on inspiration."
"In practice, the personal benefits are apparent only for persons living on national borders (some 40 million out of around 370 million across Europe) and for people who frequently travel as part of their work."
"For others, who go abroad on average once every five or six years, the savings on foreign exchange appear to be of less interest."
"The same applies to the 'easy comparison of prices of goods and services in the various Member States' , as the Pérez Royo report puts it."
"Although a degree of acceleration in cross-border purchases with the euro can be expected, we should not lose sight of the fact that the financial and other intermediaries are already well acquainted with price differentials between countries, and exploit them insofar as they can."
"Finally, the report cites a third advantage: the low interest rates resulting from a sound monetary policy."
"On this point, the sales pitch needs to be rewritten, because this benefit, although attractive at the time of Maastricht, seems to be somewhat off the point today, when interest rates have fallen to a very low level."
"Overall, however, the euro will certainly be an incentive to competition, and the consumer, at least initially, should gain."
"But it should not be forgotten that, as far as the consumer is concerned, the balance sheet does not stop here."
"On the one hand, the consumer is being asked right now to give up his or her national currency, at some personal cost, something which apparently had not always been understood."
"On the other hand consumers, who are also producers, and unfortunately sometimes unemployed, wonder what will be the impact of the euro on the overall economy."
"On this point, the claims which were so enthusiastically made at the time of Maastricht, when we heard promises of millions of jobs, are being prudently watered down."
"Very serious economists are publishing cautions against the risk of disorganization between countries, and increasing unemployment, as a result of the euro."
"It is therefore likely that the closer we are to the switch-over date, the more citizens will raise questions, and the more they will express their qualms."
"The difficulties imposed on them by the transition period may well be a focus for all their discontent."
"The European Council in Madrid decided in December 1995 on the scenario for the move over to the single currency."
"These demands are before us now, as we prepare the citizens of the European Union to the best of our ability."
"As the rapporteur has emphasized, we have every right to expect many benefits from the single currency, and one in particular: increased transparency in the pricing of the various goods and services in the Member States."
"This transparency should result in an acceleration of competition, and as we hope, a fall in prices."
"On the other hand, consumers who go to another Member State will benefit from the elimination of foreign exchange costs."
"Even so, we must be conscious of the fact that introducing the single currency raises a number of questions about the way it is implemented."
"Moving over to the euro will actually result in fundamental changes in the lives of each and every one of the consumers in the Union."
"It is within a context of some scepticism from our fellow citizens that we enter the most delicate phases of the introduction of the single currency."
"We must bear in mind the emotion and affection felt for their national currency by citizens in their respective Member States."
"It is fundamentally necessary to ensure that the euro does not, in this period, become a scapegoat for all the evils in our society, and here I am thinking in particular about unemployment."
"The fact that some may, during the transition period, have access to the euro on the financial markets and in the stock market, at a time when other citizens are unable to do so, may give rise to a certain frustration, and the feeling that there is a two-speed currency."
"The report before us today lays particular emphasis on the directions we need to go in, and on the measures which are absolutely essential."
"Firstly, emphasis should be placed on the critical components of education and training in all sectors of social life, beginning with schools, universities, consumers' associations, associations of older people, etc."
"Secondly, like the rapporteur, I believe that the dual price display system of the euro alongside national currencies should be introduced as soon as possible in the retail trading environment."
"We should accustom our citizens to think in euro terms."
"Thirdly, during the transitional period we need to pay close attention to keeping down expenses related to currency conversion between national currencies."
"In this respect my wish is, as has been emphasized by the rapporteur, that the Commission should propose regulations laying down that the conversion of bank notes from national currency into euros should be cost-free for citizens."
"As a symbolic act of unification, the euro requires of us European parliamentarians, more than ever before, to be out in the field, as the advocates of a Europe that is on the move."
"The report of Mr Perez Royo makes a cogent and convincing case for the introduction of the single currency."
"However, the European Parliament does not need to be persuaded on this issue."
"It is European citizens at large who need to be informed about the benefits of the euro and we must do more to present the arguments and issues before them."
"I am alarmed at the widespread ignorance and lack of preparation that exists, including in my own country and especially among SMEs."
"We must rectify this immediately."
"I agree with Mr Perez Royo's proposals, especially the early introduction of dual pricing in retail outlets and the use of 'dual billing' by major service providers and banks."
"Educational institutions also have a role to play, and I believe we could do much more by way of providing information in our schools and colleges."
"Consumer confidence is vital to the success of the single currency."
"However, the message at the moment is that we need to do much more if we are to achieve this."
"We in the Swedish Left Party have voted against this report."
"We are opponents of EMU and the introduction of a single currency."
"We think the advantages of EMU for consumers which are being pointed out are greatly exaggerated."
"We are also opponents of the EMU propaganda which the EU is conducting through its so-called information campaigns."
"EMU is an anti-democratic project whose fate should be decided by the people themselves in referenda."
"I thank Mr Pérez Royo for having drawn my attention to the many problems to be encountered by consumers when the euro is introduced."
"For my part, I would wish to comment on two particular aspects."
"The first relates to the expenses borne by euro users from 1 January 1999 onwards."
"We all agree in saying that one of the conditions of the successful move to the single currency is to make sure, as soon as we can, that a maximum number of consumers uses the euro in the first stage, which in practice means having a euro-denominated bank account, using euro cheques, making bank transfers in euros from 1 January 1999."
"In Luxembourg, the banks have announced that the necessary conversions of the Luxembourg franc into euros, and vice versa, will take place free of charge."
"This is a good thing."
"I do not know what is happening elsewhere, but this example should be followed everywhere."
"Furthermore, from 1999 to 2002, the costs of foreign exchange transactions within the union area should be minimal. At all events, the amount should not exceed current costs."
"However, it would be good for euro users to be convinced here and now that the new currency is more advantageous than the old system."
"Finally, it is important to say from now on that the conversion of national fiduciary currency into euros after 1 January 2002 should take place at no cost to users."
"These are the responses which are of interest to the consumer."
"Even if the expenses caused by moving over to monetary union are to be borne in one way or another, success in monetary union terms depends on the very widespread exemption of final users from such charges."
"The second aspect which interests me is what Mr Pérez Royo says about the strategy with regard to disadvantaged groups."
"A good third of the population, if not more, is unaffected by advertising campaigns, the Internet or the media."
"Special strategies must be developed for these people."
"I welcome in this respect the efforts of the Commission's Directorate-General XXIV, which has introduced pilot projects intended to develop means of information on the euro for people who are highly disadvantaged, often unable to read and who find it difficult to calculate."
"For these people, material intended to be read is no solution."
"By the way, attention must be paid to provision for such projects in the Commission's budget, no later than 1999."
"The ideas developed by Mr Pérez Royo with regard to the dissemination of information on the euro through direct economic practice are essential."
"The principle of getting those who actually use the currency involved in the information exercise, at the grass roots of the economy, is also particularly important."
"After all the political and rather theoretical considerations, we will need to get down to practical considerations, and be as concrete as possible, in order to anchor the euro firmly in everyone's consciousness, and to elaborate a new common monetary culture."
"Overall, I am satisfied with Mr Pérez Royo's report."
"It makes a contribution to highlighting the benefits from the introduction of the euro which are directly tangible to consumers."
"As our rapporteur states so very rightly, the initial benefits will consist of easier price comparison, thanks to the introduction of the euro, so making consumers' lives easier."
"The second advantage will be greater ease of travel throughout the whole of the Union, without the need to go through labourious and, above all, costly foreign exchange transactions."
"Finally, the fall in interest rates caused by healthier public finances and by a well-balanced monetary policy will give a vital boost to investment in Europe, which is a source of employment."
"Having said that, for a smooth passage to the euro, consumers need to be properly informed, and in particular prepared to think in euros."
"In order to do this, Mr Pérez Royo says that, from the outset of the third phase, that is in less than one year from now, companies should be publishing their pay slips in euros, and banks publishing accounts in the European currency."
"Similarly, he wishes a special emphasis to be laid on training in schools."
"These are ideas which I share."
"On the other hand, I permit myself some reserve with regard to the need, via a directive, to impose the practice of dual price display, because of the cost it may entail for some retail outlets."
"Of course, I am of the opinion that dual price display will be necessary, to help citizens adapt smoothly to the new currency."
"In spite of this minor reserve, I shall vote in favour of Mr Pérez Royo's report."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report by Fernando Pérez Royo concerning the euro and consumers."
"The report stresses that the changeover from the national currencies to the euro must not cost the consumers anything."
"The rapporteur recommends that the conversion of notes and coins in the national currency into euro notes and coins should be free of charge for the citizens."
"The Danish Social Democrats support this point of view, but point out that Denmark is not taking part in the third phase of economic and monetary union."
"In spite of Denmark's reservations about EMU's third phase, there is no doubt in my mind that the euro should be welcomed throughout Europe."
"There are many small and medium-sized companies, especially in Denmark, which have problems with the uncertainty which trading between different currencies entails."
"But, of course, the consumers and citizens of the European Union also need to get used to using the euro."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur when he calls for better transitional arrangements and, for example, recommends that invoices be written in both euros and the national currencies."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.53 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Transatlantic relations"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0410/97, by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council - Europe and the United States: the way forward (COM(95)0411 - C4-0411/95); -A4-0403/97, by Mrs Mann, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on transatlantic trade and economic relations."
"Mr President, it is always nice to speak to a big audience."
"My short term as a European diplomat in the United States revealed some peculiarities in their relationship to Europe."
"Here are some observations."
"US foreign policy is based on the fact that Europe does not speak with one voice and acts even less as one country."
"No common European policy exists except in folklore."
"US foreign policy does not want a strong European involvement in the Middle East or anywhere else despite some verbal assurances."
"On the West Coast of the US where I was stationed, China and the Far East were the primary concerns for the US."
"Being the only military superpower in the world investing nearly US$ 300 billion yearly in secret and not-so-secret operations, the US wants to retain its military leadership and does not intend to renounce it."
"With regard to the economy one can say the following: American business, having heavily invested in Europe, will welcome the advent of a single currency in Europe."
"On the other hand, in the US itself protectionist thinking is still rife."
"The US intends to keep its dominance in computer software, audiovisual software, films and TV."
"The European Union maintains a high profile in Washington and New York but, except for occasional visits to the West Coast, there is no presence there."
"Hence the amendment to the Souchet report about a West Coast presence."
"It seems to me that few Europeans understand the fragmented nature of American society."
"Compare Florida, Texas, Alaska, Minnesota and California; they are very different worlds."
"Last but not least, Americans in general have no knowledge whatsoever of the European Union."
"I understand that very well after having experienced the sloppy way in which many of the many Union diplomats in Washington manage their tasks."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, there is no doubt that Europe owes much to America."
"Nor is there any doubt however that America owes much to Europe."
"As both share the basic principles of the free world, they worked together to defend them and to preserve them throughout the long and dangerous period of the Cold War."
"Their relations have not always been honest."
"The United States often complained that it was shouldering very heavy burdens without receiving the appropriate understanding."
"The countries of Europe often detected a certain arrogance in America's behaviour towards them."
"With the ending of the Cold War, bipolarization and the rivalry between the two superpowers, after the earthquake of 1989, the need to free Europe and the United States from what has stood in the way of a more open relationship is becoming more and more insistent."
"God help us if the United States, as the only remaining superpower, were to step up what the Europeans - and not just the Europeans - describe as arrogance."
"The arrogance of power had already been denounced, during the Cold War, by a famous American, Senator Fulbright."
"And, quite aptly, it was recently invoked in Washington by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel."
"God help us if, on the threshold of a new globalized era, the United States believed it had sole responsibility for the whole world, and a duty to play the role of police constable of international order and security."
"Because neither is it legally entitled to do this, nor is it possible for it to act in this way."
"Fortunately the signs that emerged from the 1995 Summit Meeting in Madrid between President Clinton, Mr González and Mr Santer were that enhanced cooperation between Europe and the US, rather than rivalry and the crushing of efforts, can strengthen the institutions and the conditions of international law and order to everyone's advantage."
"The report we are debating today, after quite some delay, specifies - perhaps in rather too much detail - the issues on which we will be able to judge the development referred to above: the honesty, reciprocity and parity of European - US relations."
"And over and above the smoothing out of the current economic problems in which these contrasts are revealed, it will emphasize the tremendous importance assumed by the general framework which must contain long-term efforts for an honourable understanding, from the other side of the Atlantic as well."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the new world geopolitical framework following the fall of the Berlin Wall, relations between the United States and Europe can and should be strengthened."
"The United States enjoy world leadership in the four strategic sectors - economy, military power, technological competence and culture in a broad sense, but, both for geographical and for idealogical reasons, their leadership model is based on networks of cooperative and competitive alliances across the world."
"The alliance with Europe has been and is the strongest and most stable of all, particularly owing to the common foundation values of our societies: the protection of human rights, the model of a free society based on equal opportunities, market economy and free trade."
"It is therefore of interest to the United States that Europe should grow stronger, for example, with the single currency, which is extending eastwards, broadening the area of democracy and market economy."
"It is in the common interest that the NATO region should expand in line with the expansion of the Union, increasing the undertaking and the European position in the Alliance, and for positive relations to be established between the European Union and the Russian State."
"There is therefore a convergence of global interests between the United States and the European Union, which we can try to rebalance in a more united fashion, and which should not encounter obstacles in the bi- or multilateral disputes connected with specific economic interests of the two parties."
"For this reason, the draft New Transatlantic Agenda, enriched by Mrs Mann's report, broadly indicates and covers the many sectors in which cooperation needs to be intensified."
"I would now like to mention two particularly topical points, along with cooperation in the traditional sectors (the campaign against organized crime, the settlement of commercial and customs disputes and dialogue between companies)."
"Firstly, I would point out the commitment to build the information society together, this as yet not wellestablished society that represents our future: the rules on the networks, infrastructures and accesses, standards, intellectual property protection, electronic trading procedures, and rules on investments and cooperation between companies."
"Secondly, I want to mention the commitment to monetary cooperation between the United States and the European Union, all the more so in the now well-advanced stage of the European single currency, to ensure stability for markets and to reinforce the common prospects of growth and development."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time in two months this Parliament is adopting a resolution about the relationship with the US."
"It is extremely important that we remain consistent in the line of our policy with regard to the US."
"In its present form, the Souchet report does not contribute to this."
"Quite wrongly, the report concentrates one-sidedly on the problems in this relationship. Instead, we should make use of the opportunities for cooperation, and solve differences of opinion in a dialogue, not through threats."
"This Parliament should first and foremost welcome the intensification of the transatlantic relationship. The New Transatlantic Agenda and the joint action plan constitute useful instruments to make this happen."
"We must seize the opportunities which these instruments offer."
"One voice from both sides of the Atlantic may have a decisive impact."
"Where Mr Souchet blames the Americans for the fact that a European security and defence identity does not yet exist, he should really search his own conscience."
"Europe itself did not take the opportunity during the Council of Amsterdam."
"The Liberals argue for a strengthening of the relationship between this House and the United States Congress on the subject of human rights."
"Finally, Mr President, there is the arms trade."
"Now that the British Presidency is developing plans to step up common export regulations concerning arms, we should intensify our dialogue with the US in this area, too."
"Arms export policy is an integral component of foreign policy."
"Individual attempts from both sides to regulate the arms trade will have more chance of success if they are attuned."
"I call on the British Presidency to include this topic in the transatlantic dialogue."
"To conclude, Mr President, the Liberal Group has submitted a fair few amendments, and I hope these amendments will be approved."
"Otherwise we will have to withhold our support from the Souchet report."
"Mr President, the overall clarity, depth of analysis and foresight of these reports on the communication from the Commission on Europe and the United States are such as to overcome some of our initial reservations and objections."
"We cannot but appreciate the pragmatic, critical approach to the growing imbalance in the transatlantic relationship."
"The remedy suggested the urgent need to rethink, on more equal terms and on more serviceable parameters, the great design of a properly functioning partnership between Europe and the United States of America: particularly at the present juncture where the dogma of globalization is producing social and economic upheavals; the Asiatic flu is turning into pneumonia for the financial markets of the world and the usual formula of privatizing profits and socializing losses through the International Monetary Fund does not seem to work and presents costs unacceptable not only to Europe but also to the United States Congress."
"The Souchet report should be highly commended for its criticism of some egregious cases of American unilateralism in many fields that are already regulated by international agreements or where cooperation with other partners should have been the order of the day."
"The most ominous case is the arbitrary and unilateral decision by Congress, accepted by the Administration, to cancel a large part of United States arrears in financial contributions to the United Nations and to subject its operations to the control of American institutions like the General Accounting Office (GAO)."
"This is, of course, the work of Senator Jessie Helms of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The main purpose of the amendments we are presenting is to formulate unequivocal European support for the alternative reform of the United Nations promoted by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to preserve independence in the universal role of the organization as enshrined in its own Charter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dialogue is certainly one of the most important and finest political tools."
"So I can only say how wholeheartedly I support our having the New Transatlantic Agenda on our agenda instead of NATO."
"World peace, social justice and economically sustainable development in a world where links are becoming closer every day cannot be achieved by deterrence. Instead, what is needed is careful joint negotiation."
"Because of their economic power, the EU and the USA have a special responsibility for wellbeing on this planet."
"They are also in a position to take practical initiatives."
"But it is not a question of circumventing international fora such as the WTO and the UN, and thus undermining their credibility."
"The Helms-Burton affair is an extremely negative example of what dialogue can entail."
"The EU should denounce this example, loud and clear, as an example of the extraterritorial application of national legislation."
"What we need is legal certainty, not the arbitrary use of power."
"The EU should also use the NTA to make it clear to the USA, that economic giant, that on issues like bananas or BSE it is not economic growth or the interests of companies that should count, but the health and social welfare of our people."
"The WTO, which is without doubt a fruit of the union of the EU and the USA, certainly needs considerable reform in this respect."
"The WTO is in urgent need of social and ecological restructuring in view of its new areas of work, and must be made transparent for all members."
"The NTA could do some useful preparatory work in view of the forthcoming ministerial conference."
"The NTA should not be a club for major industrialists who dictate the agenda to politicians behind closed doors."
"Quite the contrary, it should open up means of transatlantic communication to civil society."
"In an era of multinational companies, workers should also be able to communicate, to promote their ideas about education and training, social protection and healthy jobs."
"Erika Mann's report shows which direction we should be heading in, and we shall be supporting it with a clear conscience."
"Unfortunately, Mr Souchet's report on external relations does not reflect our views, in particular the parts concerning crisis management and the use of the armed forces, even if the latter are euphemistically described as peace-keeping operations."
"The human rights field could certainly have been given more attention, and not just on the death penalty in the USA."
"We hope that the relevant amendment will gain sufficient support here."
"Nor can we comprehend why measures such as those taken by the State of Massachusetts to counter human rights abuses in Burma will be prohibited in future - quite the opposite."
"State regulation mechanisms relating to human rights must also remain a legal option."
"As I have already said, human rights should have priority over business interests."
"It is misleading to give the impression that the freedom to choose between 27 different kinds of headache pills is the same thing as the freedom to opt for an affordable health care system with equal and unrestricted access for all."
"We shall be abstaining on the Souchet report but very firmly supporting Erika Mann's report."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Mann and Mr Souchet for these two very good reports."
"I would like to say that personally, I rather agree with Mr Bertens insofar as I rather think - and here I differ somewhat from Mr Lambrias' suggestion - that we owe our American friends a little more than they owe us, at least in the course of the last 40, 50 or 60 years."
"I think it is important to remember that."
"I believe - unfortunately I fear this may make my friend Mr Manisco a little more irritated with me than he already is - that we cannot reproach the Americans with their unilateralism."
"I believe that, only too frequently, they have found themselves facing important responsibilities alone, and fortunately they were there to do so."
"The problem, here again, is that we lack a Europe with the ability to speak with a single voice, a Europe with a single policy."
"We saw this again with important cases such as the attitude towards the People's Republic of China, where the position which still prevails is the pitting of one European Member State against another, and that is the real problem."
"I would like to hold Mr Souchet to his words quite literally when he says that we should not hesitate to deal with delicate subjects head on."
"I believe - and I think that here Mr Manisco will agree with me - that there is one delicate subject which is of great concern to me and at all events to many of my colleagues in this House."
"This is the question of the death sentence in the United States."
"My group has put down two amendments, one to Mr Souchet's report and the other to Mrs Mann's."
"The amendment to Mr Souchet's report invites the United States to abolish the death penalty, not that the death penalty is incompatible with democracy - I believe that, and we say in the amendment that it is important to emphasize it - but because the abolition of the death penalty would be an extension of the sphere of fundamental rights, and it would be desirable for our American friends to integrate this into their constitution, which remains an example of democracy."
"I also believe we owe this to ourselves and to our Parliament."
"We cannot allow ourselves to make this sort of request only of the so-called poorer countries, the developing countries: we must also have the courage to make such a demand of a great country such as the United States, and I therefore most vigorously invite Mr Souchet to accept this amendment."
"The amendment to Mrs Mann's report is a little more complicated."
"There are ten or twelve states in the United States which have abolished the death penalty, and here we would need to go down a more difficult road, namely to favour not only investment by our enterprises, but also the presence of our institutions and of representations from our Member States, and through these representations from our regions, promote cultural and economic relationships with those states which have abolished the death penalty, in order to make others understand that abolition is a matter of importance to us Europeans."
"Mr President, in 1963 President Kennedy spoke the historic words: ""Ich bin ein Berliner!'"
"They conveyed the flavour of the special relationship between the United States and Europe during the Cold War."
"The United States safeguarded the defence of freedom in western Europe."
"This automatic identification with our interests is over, although this is no cause for alarm."
"The United States and Europe will continue to be closely involved with each other."
"Neither economics nor security can do without American partnership."
"In order to optimize the relationship with the United States, the following priorities could be set: the New Transatlantic Agenda, especially the lifting of barriers to trade; harmonization in new areas such as the environment, health and energy; solving trade differences by both the United States and the European Union whilst respecting the WHO pronouncements; and finally, drawing the line against evil regimes, without European countries putting their own trade interests first, with the risk that the European Union and the United States are played off against each other."
"A greater contribution of European nations to the security of our continent is best achieved by transforming the Western European Union into a European pillar within NATO."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Souchet is presenting us here with good, balanced work. Its merit is, while keeping to diplomatic forms, to reject the current bond of subservience of our nations with respect to the United States."
"This happens infrequently enough in this Parliament for it to be emphasized."
"Who, indeed, with the exception of my elected colleagues of the national right, rejects such subservience?"
"In France, the self-proclaimed inheritors of General de Gaulle, just as they have rallied to Eurofederalism, now wish to place the French army under US command, at a time when the Soviet threat has disappeared."
"They are furthermore followed in this by the communists, who clearly cannot do without foreign supervision."
"Thorès and Marchais went to Moscow for their orders."
"Hue now goes to Washington."
"We, the French patriots, have no trouble distinguishing between the real American nation, among whom we have many friends, and the Government of the United States, which is directed by believers in the ideology of globalization."
"This Government, with, alas, the complicity of our own Governments, intends to lay down a new world order in which nations and families would be crushed, and human beings become objects to be cloned at leisure."
"To impose this best of all possible worlds, the United States leaders are ready for anything."
"They have been starving the Iraqi people for nigh on eight years, and in reality are doing so to preserve their oil interests."
"Similarly, it is hardly surprising that Clinton and his administration are supporting the bureaucratic and supranational Europe, which bends to his every diktat."
"This federal Europe of the regions destroys nationhood, and is in tune with the wishes of the supporters of the global economy."
"Of course, the reality of the relationship between the United States and France is not quite that described by François Mitterrand when he said: ' France does not know this, but we are at war with America, a war without fatalities' , and added heavily, ' apparently.'"
"Those hard words, as reported by Mr Georges Marc Benamou and cited by Arnaud Aaron Upinsky in his remarkable work 'The Ortolan Syndrome' , nevertheless contain a considerable element of truth."
"What are we to do?"
"Continue the current policy of subjection?"
"Certainly not."
"But to advocate total separation of the United States and Europe would also be a deadly error, a mistake first made by the United States, whose leaders from 1776 onwards have never ceased to want to sever their links with European civilization."
"The Monroe doctrine in 1820 forbade the American continent to Europeans."
"Then there was the War of Secession in 1863."
"Today, in addition to its goods, the US is exporting all its worst aspects into our countries, although the real American people reject them: fast food, rap, ethnic bands, and to sum it up in a word, the 'raptaglang' culture."
"However, the two Americas, North and also South, have for 500 years been linked, willy-nilly, to the European nations by a community of civilizations."
"Our peoples were those who created the New World, and in particular the Spaniards and Portuguese in Latin America and the French in Canada."
"On the other hand, as Dominique Souchet notes, balance must be re-established in our relationship with America. This must, of course, be a relationship of equality, but dependent on a balance within America itself."
"America has become a world under Anglo-Saxon domination."
"However there are other Americas, with whom we must reinforce our links and help them to free themselves from Washington rule. There is a French America, which has been able to keep its identity in Quebec from 1763 onwards, thanks to its faith and vitality."
"There is a Latin America. Permit me to say that with our Latin sisters, Spain, Portugal and Italy, France must take the lead in this policy, which is based on both reason and the heart."
"Mr President, the European Parliamentary report on commercial and economic relations between the European Union and the US cannot fail to incite special interest, much more so indeed since it has been elaborated with such great care by our discriminating colleague, Erika Mann."
"It is a fact that the new reality emerging from the globalization of the economy and of politics imposes new ways of working together, multilateral agreements and the strengthening of economic, social and cultural ties between peoples."
"From this standpoint, no-one has the right to oppose the bridging of the Atlantic, if indeed there is to be a common perception of viable development and social cohesion, promotion of peace and democracy, equality of the sexes, guarantees of prosperity and security in the world, progress in science and technology, and protection of life and the environment."
"However, our partner on the other side of the Atlantic does not give a good external account of itself, since it is weighed down by a whole host of deeds from the distant and more recent past which demonstrate that it often contravenes international conventions while at the same time seeking and generally obtaining leonine agreements at the expense of less developed countries."
"With great ingenuity on a world-wide scale, the US is still attempting to impose its law and order on third country operations."
"I am talking in particular of the extraterritorial Helms-Burton and d'Amato-Kennedy Acts, which find their best implementation in the economic embargo of Cuba, and this in spite of a world-wide outcry and the condemnation of the US by the UN General Assembly."
"However, not only is the United States Congress unmoved by these protestations, but on 11 June 1997 it reinforced even more this preposterous web of legislation with eight amendments that were approved by its part-session."
"In addition to the above, it is attempting to dodge the overruling of the commercial policy of the US by the mechanism of the World Trade Organization for the settlement of disputes."
"These actions are indicative of the mentality of the US, a mentality which has been recorded in all its international dealings, even with its neighbours, its next-door neighbours, Central and Latin America."
"It is clear that the US is accepting and adopting for itself a double system: legislative protection for its own operations and interests, while at the same time demanding respect from others for the rules of competition and the free market."
"How can we therefore not be mistrustful of such a partner?"
"At a social level the increased polarization caused by the US labour model is driving large sections of the population to become marginalized and the society of the USA, slowly but surely, to become a third-world society."
"There has also been another paradox: the rate of unemployment in low-paid work has increased in parallel with the number of those who live below the poverty line."
"This is yet another American paradox which we hope will not be exported to Europe as one more transatlantic product among the many which are flooding into the Union."
"There is also the issue of the death penalty."
"I would like to say that it is impossible for the European Parliament to ask for the abolition of the death penalty in the Gulf States and to vacillate about asking the same of the United States."
"Finally, I would like to say that Parliamentary control should be exercised in matters relating to the relationship between and to cooperation between Europe and the United States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the two rapporteurs for their reports."
"I am delighted at the optimism expressed by Mrs Mann, and I essentially agree with her, so I need not repeat anything there."
"Anyone who complains about the US should be fully aware that annual trade between the European Union and the US is over $250 million."
"Just try converting that into jobs!"
"We are the most important investors in each other's markets, and the European Union and the US have derived the greatest benefit from the liberal world order."
"On the other hand, it is clearer with EU-US relations than in any other area of policy that a Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union is of momentous importance."
"With all due respect to the efforts made by the European Parliament and by the Commission, be it by you, Mr Bangemann, by Sir Leon Brittan or by many others, the importance of European institutions in the foreign policy of the US is only secondary."
"As long as individual EU Member States are competing with each other in the US, and as long as the US has the impression that on matters of substance it is hard for European politicians to speak with one voice on current foreign and security policy, it will be difficult for American politicians to recognize our political will."
"Conversely, we have had ample opportunity in recent months to witness the smugness and even arrogance with which the US Congress in particular approaches important decisions on foreign trade policy, without caring a jot about what the rest of the world thinks."
"Helms-Burton-d'Amato is just one example."
"But it is not just we Europeans who are shocked by this kind of policy; the US can also pick on Canada, Mexico, South America or anybody else without meeting any resistance worth mentioning."
"Since the collapse of communism, the behaviour of the US has become increasingly high-handed, not least because it has become the only remaining long-term world power and automatically assumes responsibility for solving problems, as if it is expected of the US."
"We even call on the Americans for help in solving European problems, because we are so reticent."
"We must agree to speak with one voice in future if Europe's interests are to be defended in the numerous transatlantic organizations."
"We proved how good this can be at the WTO meeting in Singapore, but by the time we had reached Amsterdam we seemed incapable of finding an answer to foreign trade problems that went beyond the immediate, and instead fell back on tolerance and experience."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the options, and Mr Donnelly is pushing for some kind of contact between this Parliament's delegation in the US and the US Congress."
"But we really have to ask ourselves if any country or organization has any chance of influencing Congress' foreign and foreign trade policy, if even their own US President has the greatest difficulty in getting his views heard and implemented."
"Experts on the US would say that Europeans' greatest mistake in the past was to be too respectful and too quick to compromise in various dealings."
"I believe that we should realize that with 370 million consumers and with the interests that the US has in Europe we can take a firmer line than in the past and say quite brutally what our interests are, and not be too hasty to compromise, which gets us nowhere fast."
"The fact remains that the US and Europe are dependent on each other."
"The third world, Asia and Africa need us to take a common stance so that we cannot be played off against each other or approach our responsibility for events there differently."
"I hope that both the reports before us will contribute to this recognition, that we can undertake much more together than we have in the past, and that the Commission will succeed."
"Mr President, George Washington bequeathed to his countrymen the principle of not allowing anyone to become involved in their internal affairs, and not becoming involved in the affairs of the rest of the world."
"This was the famous doctrine of American isolationism from which the Americans emerged for the first time during the First World War, and which they completely abolished with the Second, which resulted in the United States, following the fall of the walls, becoming a world-wide and ubiquitous superpower."
"We have often spoken of the imbalance that exists in Euro-American relations."
"It is true that the United States takes the decisions and Europe pays enormous bills."
"And not only in regions such as Yugoslavia or the Middle East."
"The lack of a common foreign policy and the lack of political security in the Union is, to a large extent, at fault, but it can also be blamed on our inability to establish parity of economic relations with the United States, perhaps because there are such great differences between us."
"These weaknesses are all underlined in Mr Souchet's report, which stresses the need for strengthened and equalranking cooperation, as well as the need for there to be a European identity on security and defence."
"There is a proper emphasis on Europe's obligation to express its opposition to the one-sided way in which the new members of NATO were chosen, to the unwillingness of the United States to sign the Ottawa Declaration on landmines, to the undermining of the UN on the part of Congress, to laws such as the Helms-Burton and d'Amato-Kennedy Acts, as well as to the unwillingness of the United States to accept the decisions taken for the protection of the environment."
"The crucial point to which the European Commission is now called upon to address itself is the demand to wipe out this imbalance at all levels of EU-US cooperation, as far as possible of course."
"And, if it is unavoidable, at least at this historic conjuncture and until further orders, that the United States must take precedence world-wide - and we do not know what will happen as the next century approaches - at least Europe must at this moment in time be able to have the decisive word in matters concerning its own affairs and play a greater role at a global level."
"Mr President, Mr Suchet's report is in many respects a creditable one, and I agree with much of its content."
"The report is, however, less than perfect in that it dwells on the problems we experience in our relations with the US."
"For this reason I have drafted, on behalf of the Liberal group, certain motions for amendments, which contain positive and constructive attitudes towards the development of cooperation between the European Union and the US."
"On another note, I would like to mention such cooperation in the Nordic regions."
"The US and three EU Member States have been collaborating on the foundation of an Arctic Council, and we are now creating a Nordic dimension to EU policy, in accordance with the Luxembourg Summit resolution."
"The report before us cannot, however, be improved upon in any fruitful way."
"That is why I would, finally, like to express the hope that in future reports we endeavour to get to grips with relations between the US and the EU."
"The EU and the US together must take the main responsibility for the future of humanity."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"It has been well thought through, with full regard to the many issues that affect European Union and United States relations."
"The collapse of communism in eastern Europe was welcomed by democrats everywhere, not least in western Europe."
"We realized that unless international relations were adapted to take account of the situation, it would pose great problems for world stability."
"With the end of the Cold War the established order of European and US relations was bound to change."
"We are currently going through this change."
"At times it is rather difficult."
"We should recognize that the goodwill of national governments in the European Union and that of the American administration has ensured that developments have been generally positive."
"However, in Europe there remains a perception that the United States continues to dominate the relationship of what should actually be a partnership of equals."
"Too often it appears that the US prefers to put self-interest before good relations with the European Union."
"This is most obvious in terms of international trade, where we contrast US policy with the determination of other Member States in the European Union to contribute to a fair international trading environment."
"The US can certainly do more to build fair trading conditions."
"I would hope that we, along with them, can work in conjunction to achieve that."
"Mr President, as probably the only Member of the European Parliament with dual residence in the US and in Europe, I would like to sound a note of warning about clichés and the arrogant assumption that Americans understand nothing about Europe."
"That may once have been true, but it is certainly no longer the case today."
"The basis for improved cooperation between the EU and the US is our common interest in economic policy and security."
"That means fair competition in the world market on a level playing field, and it implies special responsibility for exchange rate stability between the dollar and the planned euro."
"Poorly planned introduction of European monetary union would result in the dollar extending its present dominant position still further."
"The inferiority complex that Europeans feel towards the US, which has repeatedly come through in the various speeches here, cannot be talked away: we can only overcome it by real economic strength and an unambiguous security policy."
"As regards linking economic relations with individual countries to their human rights record, we Europeans should not be criticizing this, we should instead join forces with the US."
"Mr President, George Bernard Shaw once remarked that England and America are two countries divided by a common language."
"I increasingly believe that the EU and the US are two political entities divided by a common political and economic system."
"Far too often our relationship is characterized by misunderstandings and confusions."
"I agree with Mr Donner that this is perhaps more so from the American side than from the EU side."
"We saw this during the enlargement debate where the American approach to the speed and nature of EU enlargement, particularly to the role of Turkey in this, was, quite frankly, extremely simplistic."
"I was amazed to hear senior American politicians talk blithely about Turkey joining the European Union, as if it was a very simple matter."
"I suspect that part of the reason for Turkey's total over-reaction to the conclusions of the Luxembourg Summit was that it has been encouraged by some American politicians, at least, to believe that it would get more out of the European Union."
"It is for this reason that this dialogue is so important."
"I would endorse Mrs Erika Mann's remarks about ensuring there is an effective parliamentary element to this dialogue, so that we can make clear to each other exactly where we stand."
"This is certainly true of the foreign affairs field where the old certainties of the Cold War are now at an end and have been replaced by a situation of much greater uncertainty and insecurity."
"Clearly we need closer cooperation, although that cooperation has to be within an international framework."
"Some of today's debate has smacked, quite frankly, of EU-US imperialism."
"We should be operating in a security situation which is multinational and international, and not simply bilateral."
"Bosnia, more than anything else, showed where things can go wrong, unless we get this relationship right."
"It also showed that once we get the relationship right we can actually make considerable progress."
"But for that to happen, Europe has got to stop spending so much time developing strong rhetoric and a little bit more time acting in the foreign affairs field."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many previous speakers I would like to say that transatlantic relations now have to be seen in a new light."
"This is generally recognized, but the corresponding conclusions have not always been drawn."
"In this century, transatlantic relations have been notable for the United States of America playing a decisive role in preserving order in Europe."
"The question is how the Americans will continue to use their power in Europe and how we can use our own power to become a partner of the US on equal terms."
"I consider that the Souchet and Mann reports provide some good starting points."
"Things are not as simple as in the past, when the fear of danger in the minds of our two peoples welded together the nations on either side of the Atlantic."
"This awareness of danger has dramatically declined since 1990, and there is accordingly now a danger that minor trade policy disputes will escalate to such an emotional level that they could widen the gap between Europe and America."
"For this reason we need to link the great community of values based on the rule of law and on democracy with a renewed community of interests not limited solely to security matters."
"That is why I believe that the Transatlantic Agenda, the efforts of the Commission and the American administration and the initiatives that you, Commissioner Bangemann, have kicked off in recent years in the field of commerce and industry, in order to achieve progress towards a Transatlantic Market Place, are all important signs that differences of interest need not lead to a widening of the gap. On the contrary, they demonstrate that in a world based on multilateral trade we see each other as partners on equal terms engaged in fair competition, not as opponents."
"We accordingly need not only to develop our ability to act as equal partners through improvements in foreign and security policy, but we also need the US to understand this."
"The use of extraterritorial legislation, as with HelmsBurton or NATO, proves that the United States have still not discovered how to play their role as the sole world power in a fair manner. Indeed, it suggests that they think they can now play a dominant role."
"It is my belief, therefore, that besides trade policy initiatives, we must also seek to strengthen the means available to us at political level, but not as an alternative to NATO."
"I believe that the Washington treaty and its provisions must endure, and that we must ensure that all this complements NATO, in accordance with the new, wider powers of the European Union."
"And for the same reason I believe we should take advantage of the momentum generated by the Transatlantic Agenda, the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and the development of a Transatlantic Market Place. We should exploit this momentum in order to enter into an EU-US treaty which binds the US Congress, because only then, if Congress and the entire political machinery in the United States are committed, can we succeed in bringing about such a treaty via a cooperation and consultation mechanism, a treaty that would unite us Europeans and Americans in such a way that we could jointly exercise our values in this world."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on producing an excellent report."
"As an Irishman I am mindful of the work carried out by the United States in promoting peace and stability in the world, not least in its support for the peace process in Ireland."
"I should like to take this opportunity to commend the work of the United States, and President Clinton in particular, in seeking to resolve the tragic conflict on the island of Ireland."
"I have a particular concern, however, regarding differences in agricultural policy between the European Union and the United States, which have served to put European agriculture and European farmers at a disadvantage."
"For example, the European consumer is firmly opposed to the use of hormones in meat production and European agriculture has adopted its practices accordingly."
"Similarly, there seems to be more vocal opposition to the use of genetically modified organisms in Europe than in the United States."
"There are differences of emphasis on the use of biotechnology in food production also."
"In addition, the common agricultural policy places certain restrictions on production which do not apply to American farmers."
"In the context of the application of world trade regulations, I call for greater transparency in the application of these measures."
"America always seems to be very well - if not too well - briefed in relation to what is happening in European agriculture, and I am not always sure if we in Europe are aware of what is happening at all times on that side of the Atlantic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her excellent report."
"For years and years there have been strong ties between the European Union and the United States."
"The bilateral economic ties generate the largest trade flows in the world."
"In addition, the Union and the United States are each other's biggest investors."
"The EU represents 58 % of foreign investments in the United States, and 44 % of American investments are made in the European Union."
"On both sides of the Atlantic these investments are worth 3 million jobs."
"It is a pity, therefore, that there is so little awareness amongst the European and American people of how crucial our cooperation is for their employment, and thus their prosperity."
"American and European citizens should be much better informed on the importance of our trade relations for both economies."
"Consultation at government level is essential, but without support amongst the public and their representatives - the United States Congress and the European Parliament - this will not produce any results."
"That is why parliamentary control by the European Parliament is so necessary."
"The building of bridges in the context of the New Transatlantic Agenda, as aimed at and already achieved by the Ties project, involves the public directly in transatlantic relations."
"The quality of this relationship has great impact on world trade, now and in the future."
"That is why it is extremely important that the Union and the United States settle their differences."
"Under no circumstances should the Union accept the extraterritorial operation of US legislation."
"I will make this clear again during the talks with the American Members of Congress next Friday in Brussels."
"Mr President, of course the different aspects of the relations between the European Union and the United States are not at the same level."
"There are aspects such as the commercial or the economic aspects where we can see that the European Union does have a claim. There are aspects such as the environment, where we saw in Kyoto the attempt of the European Union to formulate a separate strategy."
"But in central position, in the nucleus of the relations, where we find the political and strategic relations, we can say that the United States is totally dominant and that there also exists American hegemony."
"This hegemony is fuelled less by the feeling of power of the United States, by its nuclear arsenal, by its global presence, and much more by the inferiority complex of the European Union which is due to the fact that top-ranking leaders in Europe operate as employees of the United States, by the inability of the European Union to fashion an identity of its own and to formulate a strategy of its own on the basis of which it can have talks with - and not be compared with - the United States."
"I agree with Mr Titley that we have seen this recently mainly over the issue of Turkey. What was the position of the United States with respect to all that happened in Luxembourg?"
"To insist that Turkey could accede to the European Union in spite of its lack of democracy, which indeed exists."
"What was the position of the United States on the important issue of the Kurdish refugees?"
"Total silence, tolerance and the shielding of Turkey."
"What was the position of the United States on Greek-Turkish differences?"
"The other day we watched in amazement as the representative of the US Government supported the most extreme expansionist ambitions of Turkey in Aegean air space and spoke of Greece's lack of right to a 10 mile air exclusion zone."
"I would like to hope that the European Union will have a stronger presence and, Mr President, I think that the absence of the Council in such a serious political matter shows the seriousness with which the European Union takes this issue."
"Mr President, I thought this had been a reasonably well-informed and intelligent debate, until I heard the last contribution."
"I would like, particularly, to address the report of Mrs Erika Mann, but to thank both rapporteurs for their work."
"I would like to address some comments to the Commission."
"The first thing I would like to say to Mr Bangemann is: I think it would be very helpful if the Commission could provide some information packs for all Members of the European Parliament about the New Transatlantic Agenda."
"It was established in 1995 and some of us who are very interested in US-European affairs have followed it very carefully."
"But I suspect that many Members of this House do not realize the depth of participation and, indeed, the leadership role that the European Union has played in many of these negotiations."
"Similarly, on the new Transatlantic Business Dialogue that Mrs Mann referred to in her address, it would be very helpful again if, in that pack of information, we set out exactly what has happened and, again, the important leadership role that the European Union is playing in this sphere, too, and the leadership role we played particularly on the mutual recognition agreements."
"That would not have been possible without the leadership role of the European Union."
"To those people who seem to say that we are slaves of the United States, I say please read the information and understand the crucial role that we are playing in pushing forward this agenda."
"I want to look to the future rather than looking to the past."
"We have had a relationship in the past based particularly on security policy."
"That will continue with the enlargement of NATO."
"But I want to refer to a couple of other issues."
"For example, the collapse of the financial markets in the Far East will mean that the stable and balanced trading relationship between Europe and the United States is going to be absolutely pivotal over the next few years."
"The Americans, who have perhaps been turning their attention to the Far East - and indeed some investors in the European Union who turned their attention to the Far East - are going to come back and rely very heavily on the stable relationship between the United States and the European Union."
"We should use that as an opportunity for deepening the transatlantic business dialogue and also deepening the investment relationship."
"We then have the creation of the euro."
"Within about 4 or 5 years, 40 % of all invoicing in world trade will be in the euro."
"We need to look at the relationship between the dollar and the euro."
"What mechanisms are we going to establish in order to have this relationship?"
"Let us look to the future and make sure that this is the sort of dialogue we have in the future."
"Regarding Third Pillar issues - fighting drug trafficking, fighting international crime - how can we strengthen the dialogue in that area too?"
"What suggestions has the Commission to deal with that question?"
"I should like to talk briefly about the transatlantic summit meeting."
"That is a very special summit meeting that is held twice a year."
"We need to find a way of making it even better."
"I suggest to the Commission today: please find a way of involving parliamentarians in some dimension of that summit."
"There is absolutely no reason why representatives of Congress and the European Parliament should not be involved twice a year in the summit."
"If we do that, then it means some of the nonsense that we have had out of Congress on Helms-Burton and the ILSA legislation can be countered because Congress representatives would have to sit at the table and take part in that dialogue."
"Let us, in May, invite Members of Congress and of this House to the transatlantic summit meeting in London and make sure this special relationship extends beyond just the Commission, the Council and the administration to involve the legislators, too."
"Mr President, the end of the Cold War and the growing strength of the European Union inevitably has led to a redefinition of the relationship between ourselves and the United States."
"For historical and cultural reasons there has been a common bond between the United States and Europe, particularly where there was a common foe to fight or a common objective to pursue."
"Nowhere is it more true than in the case of my own country where the US has consistently supported the Irish and British Governments in their quest to find a peaceful resolution to the age-old conflict in Northern Ireland."
"We in Ireland sincerely appreciate the personal commitment given by President Clinton to the Northern Ireland peace process."
"However, as regards the relationship with Europe in general, it must be acknowledged in all truth that it was a relationship of unequals."
"In the past, for perfectly understandable reasons, Europe was overly dependent on the United States and, as a consequence, our independence and freedom to act differently from our US allies was seriously compromised."
"Any future relationship, if it is to be successful, must be based on a genuine partnership between equals, irrespective of whether the joint action is in the field of world security, peace-keeping, crisis management, tackling the international drug barons or combatting terrorism."
"It must be joint action jointly agreed on the basis of mutual respect with full consultation."
"The EU cannot simply play the role of a subordinate paymaster."
"Furthermore, given the United States policy of reducing its military presence in Europe and other parts of the world, we have to reassess the new European role and responsibility."
"We need to develop a European identity in security and defence."
"Although a decision on this issue was regrettably avoided in the recent Amsterdam Treaty, we cannot run away from making such a decision for much longer."
"A European defence pillar must be established in the context of the Western European Union which should ensure that we have available in the event of a crisis our own military means of intervention, independent of the stance adopted by the United States."
"Europe must continue to maintain a warm, constructive and cooperative relationship with the United States."
"We must proceed to put in place the institutional mechanisms which will copper-fasten this."
"However, we must also feel able to pursue the policies which give Europe the freedom to disagree with our US friends in areas, for example, where we must act to protect European Union trade, not least in the field of agriculture; or foreign policy areas - such as our differing views on banning landmines, abolishing capital punishment or the role of the United Nations."
"Friends should be able to disagree with one another on the basis of mutual respect, while at one and the same time, working together on global issues such as the preservation of world peace, security and democracy and the protection of human rights."
"When we can do that then we will have achieved a true relationship of equals."
"Let me conclude by paying tribute to the two rapporteurs for producing these reports and contributing to this debate."
"Mr President, the transatlantic bridge is showing cracks."
"The US, as a federal state with one voice towards the outside world, is awaiting what the outcome will be of the institutional reforms in Europe, and what will become of the euro."
"That is why it is a good thing that the rapporteurs, Mr Souchet and Mrs Mann, emphasize active interpretation of the Transatlantic Agenda."
"It is clear that the contrasts between the old and new world will come up with increasing frequency in the economic and trade areas, especially when the euro appears to be a success, and the adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy and enlargement are successful."
"The European Parliament resides in Brussels in a building which, in its design, at least to my mind, has clearly been inspired by the Capitol in Washington."
"How nice it must be for our American colleagues to be able to have further talks with us in this building about how we can prevent a repeat of extraterritorial legislation."
"Why can we not agree here that before the end of 1998 we will discuss with our American colleagues what the future of SFOR in former Yugoslavia should be, or discuss with them and convince them of the fact that allowing European audio-visual cultural products fits in with free global trade?"
"The relations between the United States and Europe still constitute a substantial basis for stability in the world."
"This relationship can be developed."
"I am in favour of Atlanticism."
"Having been born before 1950, I still consider guaranteeing international peace and stability as the most essential element of our relationship."
"The Transatlantic Agenda, as worked out in the Souchet and Mann reports, to my mind offers a good opportunity for this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, the debate on transatlantic relations always contains elements of great political interest."
"As has been shown this evening, giving transatlantic relations a political, economic and commercial framework which will allow the development of cooperation in as many areas as possible needs to be one of our objectives for the near future."
"Nevertheless it is worth remembering, firstly, that the European Union is the foremost commercial power in the world. Secondly, the establishment of the euro should be a stimulus to negotiations on the New Transatlantic Agenda."
"Thirdly, against a background of globalization - which will particularly favour the most competitive economies - the European Union cannot forget its obligations to those countries which face difficulties. Nor can it alter its traditional system of bilateral negotiation, cut its cooperation budgets, or shield itself, as the United States does, either as a means of external reprisal or as the result of hypothetical internal pressures."
"We all recognize the important role the United States has played in the defence of democracy."
"However, that does not mean that their concept of democracy has always been the same as ours. Their legitimate eagerness to help people gain their freedom has sometimes resulted in unusual laws, claiming national security or external threats as a sacrosanct excuse, and leading (in the case of Cuba for example) to bilateral relations being placed in a delicate situation."
"We have to realize that the European Union has a certain disadvantage compared with the United States when it comes to making decisions in exceptional situations."
"It is difficult to implement trade defence mechanisms in response to external pressures, as we have found, but it is not impossible."
"As the European Union becomes more widely seen as a political entity, our negotiating position in the international institutions will become stronger. This will be particularly important in the case of the World Trade Organization, which is the body to which all disputes should be referred, instead of trying to resolve them through the back door, with the Europeans always giving in for the sake of pax americana ."
"The European Union cannot give up and cease to play its rightful role as the world's most important commercial power."
"We should include other - possibly unpleasant - questions in the agenda, such as environmental or social matters."
"Finally, I want to congratulate Mrs Mann for her magnificent piece of work. And I should like to remind the Commission that, on our part, the New Transatlantic Agenda should also take account of the development of the whole American continent, to which we are bound by a wide range of agreements, of varying importance, which will facilitate the great Atlantic market."
"The United States is also interested in this, and wants to stimulate it. What can never be included in this agenda, but has sometimes been suggested, is the supposed distribution of political power, in the form of zones of influence, so that South and Central America becomes yet another area under the clear influence of the United States."
"Mr President, having first congratulated the rapporteurs, as my colleagues have done, I want to say that we are all aware of the European Union's real importance on the international stage, and of the inadequacies in this area which the Treaty of Amsterdam has not yet been able to rectify."
"While we in the European Union are discussing our positions in strict and long-winded procedures, the United States is capable of making an overnight decision and summoning the conflicting parties, whether it is a question of Bosnia or, as is due to happen next week, the main players in the Middle East peace process."
"In fact, Mr President, the European Union still provides most of the financial contribution, and most of the overall development aid to the rest of the world - and nobody (or hardly anyone) realizes that we do so. The truth is, we are restricting ourselves to the honorable role of footing the bill for the great dramas of the modern world."
"However, although we are small in political terms, in the economic sphere, when we act in unison, we are the greatest commercial, financial and industrial power on the planet."
"And as other speakers have mentioned before me, this role can be increased following the introduction of EMU, with the advantages it will bring. I think this fact - our economic strength - should be the basis of our relations with the United States."
"These relations must be put into a global context, with a new perspective on the contested objectives, based on the different form in which today's threats present themselves."
"Thanks to the rapporteurs' hard work, the report describes these objectives perfectly, and I agree with the rapporteurs that they are a little vague."
"I think it is time for the European Union's diplomacy to stop being purely declarative in nature."
"On the subject of turning words into actions, I want to mention one of the most revealing cases: the Helms-Burton Act."
"Showing the utmost warmth and friendship at all times - as befits loyal colleagues - the United States has been relentless in the banana panel and the hormone panel. Let us not be naive."
"Let us act with the same determination as they do, because unfortunately where matters of trade are concerned the only language they understand is the exploitation of all the available legal loopholes."
"We have the example of certain mergers and concentrations currently being examined by the European Commission's Directorate-General IV: the codes of conduct for the computerized booking systems in the case of American Airlines, or the recent dispute between a major energy company within the European Union and the American giant, Arko."
"Friends and colleagues, yes, Mr President, but when it comes to defending our interests, we must be as resolute as they are."
"Mr President, this is a timely debate because it is at the end of this week that the United States Congress is coming over to Europe for our twice-yearly meetings and a good pair of resolutions, I am sure, will help to give the American Congress some idea of our feelings."
"Although I hope they will not take too much notice of some of the rather intemperate remarks that have been made by participants in this debate so far."
"However, I think the Americans will take us slightly less seriously if they read carefully Mr Souchet's resolution, particularly paragraphs 10, 11 and 14 thereof which refer to a bit of legislation of which I had not previously heard called the Amato-Kennedy act."
"May I appeal to the rapporteur to put that right in verbal amendments tomorrow when we vote because otherwise the Americans might think that it is some form of new-style cohabitation between Democrats on the one side of the House of Representatives and the Congress and Republicans on the other side."
"Of course cohabitation is not entirely unknown here in the European Parliament."
"When references were being made earlier on to hostility on the part of people in the United States towards the European Union, I did not expect to hear quite so much hostility to the United States on behalf of Members of the European Parliament, particularly from Mr Antony who sits behind me and Mrs Ainardi who sits opposite me."
"Is this some form of cohabitation à la française I ask myself?"
"The dangers that arise from the relationship are ones which have been quite rightly drawn attention to by Mrs Mann in particular."
"Those are protectionism, and we are both equally guilty of that, as can be seen by anyone who looks at the reports produced every year by the European office in Washington and by the United States trade representative on European barriers to trade."
"The curious thing about those barriers to trade is that they often complain about the same thing, wine for example."
"The Americans complain that we will not allow Californian champagne, Californian claret, Californian sherry and so on to circulate freely here in the European Union - quite right too you might say, because after all these are special names which we all very much cherish."
"Then if you read the account of barriers to trade by the European Commission office they say: ' Do you know the Americans have the impertinence to produce Californian champagne and Californian claret etc.?'"
"It just shows in other words that we are equally guilty of protectionism."
"I hope that there will be a sensible conclusion to our debate."
"The relationship is vitally important for both sides but, please, a little less arrogance by 'us Europeans' towards 'those Americans' ."
"Mr President, like others I should like to congratulate both our rapporteurs who have contributed excellent documents to this debate."
"In making my comments I should first like to look at the historical perspective of this debate."
"We have two parallel lines for our relationships with the United States today."
"The first - the NATO relationship - is based on political security and has the highest profile."
"It is the one which preserves US dominance and where there are significant problems as we come to NATO's 50th anniversary: for example how we deal with Bosnia, our relationship with Russia, NATO enlargement and arms industry procurements."
"All these are difficult questions."
"It is interesting that the large part of Mr Souchet's report deals with economic matters and although NATO is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum, nothing is said about our approach to it in the future."
"Erika Mann's report is much more concerned with the philosophy of partnership, with political and economic matters where the European Union has the capacity to act and where we are, in effect, building a new transatlantic bridge for the twenty-first century."
"It is not surprising that those involved in this kind of debate are more optimistic than those involved in the NATO debates."
"Secondly, what are the chances for the New Transatlantic Agenda to succeed?"
"I would say that they are very high."
"We are dealing with issues which affect the political and economic communities on both sides, with the arguments of globalization and with common interests."
"The Transatlantic Business Dialogue is moving towards the idea of the new transatlantic marketplace."
"The summary by the senior level group given at the EU - US Summit of 5 December is so full of priorities and ideas that I will be surprised if the administrations can make much headway within six months."
"There are statements on the Ukraine, climate change, electronic commerce and regulatory cooperation."
"It is all to be done and no one quite knows how to do it."
"As speakers have said, we shall next be dealing with the monetary dialogue, to try to get a new consensus between domestic and international monetary policies on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Lastly, where do we head to next?"
"Both EMU and enlargement of the EU and NATO are going to bring a new dimension to transatlantic relations."
"Post-Cold War, there is a clear and developing linkage between economic, political and security aspects and policy-making."
"Inevitably, therefore, NATO and EU are condemned to have a dialogue even if - as an American ambassador said - they live in the same town but actually on different planets."
"We have to have an effective transatlantic partnership in the twenty-first century based on a coherent institutional framework involving greater parliamentary cooperation and the concept of the new transatlantic marketplace."
"Ironically, the more that Europe is capable of bearing its responsibilities, the stronger the transatlantic relationship in the twenty-first century will be."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 1989/90 was a turning point in world politics."
"During the Cold War era, we were concerned with managing the status quo - now we are trying to manage change."
"All aspects of transatlantic cooperation are affected by the dynamics of this change."
"That is why it is right and proper that we are debating relations between Europe and the US here in the European Parliament today."
"There are critical questions to be addressed: for example cooperation on security policy or in the field of foreign trade and the world economy."
"It is both desirable and necessary that Europe should play an independent security policy role."
"But it has never been so clear in recent years as in the Balkans how important US participation is."
"The US will also need to play an active role in resolving the conflict between Greece and Turkey and the Cyprus situation."
"A more effective common foreign and security policy for the EU Member States is also important here in the context of strengthening transatlantic relations."
"We Europeans are also united with the United States by a common interest in open markets and free world trade."
"We should work on the assumption that the world can only achieve economic growth and prosperity if we do not revert to the old ways of protectionism and isolate ourselves from each other, but instead open ourselves up to competition and develop our economies in open, competitive markets."
"Listening to today's debate, it is obvious that there is no future for Colbert here."
"Our weak point is often that Europe is not competitive enough."
"Cultural, spiritual and religious bonds tie America and Europe together in spite of any economic and political tensions."
"We should take care to nurture these common roots more carefully in future, because they serve to bind us together and will do so all the more in the future."
"A transatlantic community needs to be based on our community of interest, not our conflicts of interest."
"If the western world's societies, and I mean the whole western world, cannot lend each other support based on their varying experience, and tackle the new order of the world economy and world political relations together, then we will be squandering invaluable political, economic, social and cultural energy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are at present witnessing an enormous crisis in the ASEAN states, that is bound to have global consequences."
"The question I ask myself is just what rapid action the European Union and America can take in this case."
"I believe we need to develop joint mechanisms to stabilize the situation there."
"Maybe we can help as quickly as possible with convergence criteria, benchmarking and best practice."
"I am afraid that if we do not help speedily, the consequences for us could be dangerous."
"The second point that particularly concerns me about relations between Europe and the United States is that Austria put a very valuable art collection, which belongs to a foundation, at America's disposal."
"Now, two pictures from this collection have been unilaterally seized, and I can honestly say that I cannot personally imagine how, if a collection is made available to someone, a collection belonging to a foundation, they can thank you by seizing two important pictures."
"Mr President, I just wish to say briefly that I realize Commissioner Bangemann could not give a clear response to my request regarding the transatlantic summit meeting."
"I should like to ask that he would at least take the idea back and discuss it with the President of the Commission and the Council, because I see that as one way of changing some of the misunderstandings on both sides of the Atlantic in both legislative bodies."
"As Mr Donnelly has rightly recognized, I cannot at this stage commit the Commission as a whole."
"However, I am quite sure that he has touched upon a current problem which needs to be resolved now and, as I said, I have no doubt that the Commission as such and the President will be much more open to that request than maybe was the case in the past."
"I will convey the message to the Commission, and Sir Leon Brittan will give you an answer to it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Foodstuffs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0401/97) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposals for Council Directives relating to foodstuffs intended for human consumption."
"Mr President, we shall be debating breakfast products at the wrong time, but I think we are all concerned at the quality of these products. I am sure our debate will be of an equally high quality."
"I would remind you that the Commission's objective, when it presented the five proposed modifications, was to modernize two directives dating back to the 1970s, on the basis of a single principle: specifying only those things which are essential to ensure the free circulation of the products in question, in particular sugar, honey, fruit juice, jellies and preserves, and totally or partially dehydrated preserved milk."
"This is certainly a praiseworthy objective, provided consumer interests are seriously taken into consideration."
"The reflection of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is that substantial amendments are required to the Commission's proposals. In this respect, we have based ourselves on two principles."
"The first is to get a dynamic of ever-increasing product quality going. The second is that the consumer has a right to correct information, that is, avoiding any misunderstanding over the name of the products, and the adoption of clear labelling."
"I am putting my finger on a number of gaps or weaknesses in the texts, which have given rise to amendments broadly adopted by the Commission, the overall report having been adopted unanimously."
"The first comment relates to information."
"As with chocolate, in the case of fruit juice and preserved milk, we are confronted with a situation of differences in national legislation, particularly as regards the possible addition of vitamins."
"As these legislations are different - and should remain so according to the Commission's proposals - consumers will find themselves potentially, in each Member State, faced with two types of slightly different products which are labelled in the same way, or at least given the same name."
"We believe this is not acceptable, and the name should be slightly amended, by the addition of the word 'vitaminized' , if that is the case."
"The second comment relates to the quality of products."
"There are a number of apparent gaps in the texts, particularly as regards sugars."
"Account should be taken of the technical changes which make it possible to reduce the residual content of sulphur dioxide, which is a constituent which is really not desirable in sugar."
"It is possible to reduce its content from 15 mg/kg to10 mg/kg, as is confirmed by the industrial manufacturers."
"This second comment also relates to fruit juice."
"You know that fruit juice can be either unadulterated juice from the pressing of the fruit, or a juice obtained by rehydration after dehydration."
"In this case, the quality of the water added to obtain the final product, known as 'rehydrated fruit juice' , should be clearly codified, and this is not the case in the proposal."
"An amendment from the Committee on the Environment intends to close this loophole."
"Furthermore, as regards the possible addition of sugar to fruit juice, there is cause for surprise that no limit value is stated in the proposal."
"That is why the Environment Committee proposes setting down a limit value, which is quite simply not to overstep the sugar concentrations which occur naturally."
"Finally, I insist on a more important point, as this is the matter of a debate which has already stirred this Parliament on a number of occasions - the problem of honey. In January 1995, Mrs Lulling's report on the quality of honey, and the major problem of imported honey, contained a number of requirements adopted unanimously by Parliament."
"I would remind you that half the honey consumed in Europe is imported honey, which therefore comes from outside the European Union, under conditions of quality which are absolutely not guaranteed. We therefore believe that for imported honey, labelling should be compulsory and not an option left in the hands of the Member States."
"Also, we believe it is time to define a serious, analytical method for honey, which we still do not have. Finally, we also believe that the excessively grand term 'baker's honey' should be removed, as it applies to a product which is in fact denatured and would be more appropriately termed 'industrial honey.'"
"These are the two main amendments."
"I would like to raise two questions with the Commissioner."
"First of all, what does he think about what I consider to be some of the most important amendments - namely Amendments Nos 19 and 28 on honey, and Amendment No 42 on fruit juice?"
"Secondly, what is his position on the legal basis proposed, in the knowledge that several colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party have put down amendments with the aim of modifying Article 100a?"
"Personally, this modification is acceptable to me, but all the information at our disposal to date indicates that it is coming up against great hostility from the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on his - what shall we call it? - fivefold report, and I would like to wish the Commissioner a happy New Year."
"We would have liked to have wished him a happy Christmas with reference to the chocolate debate, but we were not fortunate enough to see him."
"A little belatedly then: happy New Year."
"The rapporteur has elucidated the most important amendments very thoroughly."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner a question in connection with the legal basis."
"In our group we were a little surprised, Mrs Schleicher, that these amendments appeared during the discussion in the plenary session."
"But do not worry; we are not opposed to these amendments a priori , but we do have a question, because this matter has been dealt with principally by this Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"Both have come to the decisive answer that in these five cases which we are discussing today, the correct legal basis ought to be Article 43."
"As individual Members of the European Parliament, as members of Parliamentary committees, or as Parliament, we are obviously always in favour of a procedure which is subject to codecision, as this obviously means that the rights of Parliament are better safeguarded. We believe that as the only democratically elected institution, we are closer to the consumer and therefore better placed, we think, to protect the interests of the consumer."
"On the other hand, we should also exercise a little honesty."
"We must make sure that such an amendment, if we want to enforce it, is legally on tip-top solid ground, because otherwise we might be doing a bit of window-dressing for ourselves, and deluding ourselves in the process."
"I am under the impression, Mrs Schleicher, Mr Lannoye, ladies and gentlemen, that this problem is like the one concerning Article 43 or Article 100a."
"The problem is that Article 43 is not subject to a codecision procedure, and sadly enough, the Treaty of Amsterdam has brought no solace."
"Nonetheless we do not want to condemn the amendments."
"If we want to go some way with you, then we would like to receive a legally-founded answer to the amendments from our colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party."
"The rapporteur has very clearly explained a number of comments with regard to the amendments."
"If you look at the package of the five products, they are not really amendments which have all been inspired by extreme concern for the consumer, protection of the consumer and information for the consumer."
"Evidently, this Parliament is not divided over this."
"When it concerns the origin of honey products, we definitely think this should be labelled overtly."
"If vitamins have to be added, we definitely think this should be labelled overtly."
"The cohesion here in this Parliament shows a marked contrast to our lack of cohesion when it comes to chocolate."
"Here, the information we should give the consumer is almost unlimited."
"When it comes to chocolate, this Parliament is suddenly very modest."
"I will keep up the New Year's atmosphere and conclude that in the country of milk and honey we all agree, but the moment we discuss chocolate we become extra bitter."
"My colleague Mrs Graenitz will explain the amendments relating to honey shortly, and for the rest I think we will be able to vote on all amendments in close consultation and in great agreement."
"They represent progress."
"Let us hope that in addition to the amendments surrounding the legal basis, the Commission will also approve the other amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lannoye report was adopted in committee by a large majority, and my group supports the amendments before us."
"Mr De Coene, you have just reminded us how illogical people can sometimes be."
"I think it is human nature not always to be logical."
"Nevertheless, I think we should try to proceed logically, and that is why I think we keep encountering a particular fundamental problem more and more often recently. I am referring to the legal basis."
"Article 43 is normally taken as the basis for draft directives concerned with the production and marketing of agricultural products, as listed in Annex II to the EC Treaty, and therefore relates to the achievement of Common Agricultural Policy objectives."
"Alternatively, there is Article 100a - the codecision procedure."
"This legal basis relates to the establishment and functioning of the internal market by approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States - that is, harmonization."
"Harmonization directives should guarantee the free movement of the products in question."
"The Commission proposal which inspired Mr Lannoye's report is concerned with five products, namely sugar, honey, fruit juices, milk and jam."
"These are all pre-processed products derived solely from agricultural products."
"Even the milk referred to is condensed or dried milk."
"The Commission has taken Article 43 as the legal basis."
"We consider Article 100a to be the correct legal basis, even if things have not always been done this way in the past."
"But things have also moved on in terms of legal precedents, not least the amendment of the treaties, and, unfortunately, current events."
"Because of the BSE crisis, the Commission has undertaken that in future all legal instruments relating to foodstuffs and health protection should be based on Article 100a of the EC Treaty."
"It is therefore very much to the point that the Commission proposal on sugar, honey, fruit juices, milk and jams includes provisions on consumer and health protection, namely labelling, the residual sulphur dioxide content of sugar, packaging, flavouring and vitamin content, water quality in fruit juices, limit values for nitrates, sodium, calcium, and so on, and labelling requirements for fruit juices, milk products and jams with added vitamins."
"The whole area of Community law on foodstuffs is now dealt with under Article 100a of the EC Treaty."
"We are therefore requesting in the strongest terms that the correct legal basis should be taken for this Commission proposal, that is Article 100a, and I would like to ask you again, Mr Bangemann, as a representative of the European Commission, whether you will support this European Parliament proposal."
"Failing that, I shall request referral back to committee, if the Commission is not yet able to agree."
"We are effectively fighting against Article 43 here, and if we are to change our position, we really need some form of reassurance."
"We cannot just stand back and see what happens."
"That is our request, and I hope the Commission will not only carefully consider it, but will also act consistently, and thus logically, in this matter."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Lannoye on a good product."
"Food is not such a simple matter."
"In the proposal from the Commission it says that the directive should be simplified, but simplicity is often opposed to safety."
"We know that when markets for all goods grow, especially for food - that is, when food is transported further and further away from the place of production (one of the ideas of the EU and a free market economy is that this should be possible) - something else also happens."
"The direct information which in former times was linked to the person who sold the food, the person who produced the food, disappears."
"Instead, we buy something without knowing what it is, unless it says on it what it is."
"Therefore I believe we must find a balance between simplicity and safety which is more on the side of safety than the proposal which the Commission has put forward."
"If we do not do that, we take the risk that consumers will not get sufficient information."
"I would also like to point out something which is in one of the amendments, namely that regardless of whether a product has been produced inside or outside the EU, it should be subject to the same rules, not least in view of the preceding debate we had in this House."
"Mr President, I have requested leave to speak in order to emphasize an extremely important, fundamental element in the report on this food directive, in which the rapporteur gives the Commission a welldeserved rebuff."
"It concerns two paragraphs with essentially the same content, in which the Commission wants to establish that 'to avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting more detailed rules.'"
"Mr Lannoye, on the other hand, wants to give Member States the right to adopt or keep more detailed rules."
"According to Mr Lannoye, it is not necessary for the Commission to approve these kinds of tough rules."
"Nor is it necessary to have a number of other limitations contrary to what is said in Article 100a 4 of the EU Treaty, which, through a number of modifications in its new form under the Amsterdam Treaty, has totally lost the character of a so-called environmental guarantee and has shrunk to a kind of limited opportunity for exemption."
"But in the Lannoye report something has been drafted which begins to resemble an environmental and health guarantee - that is, a right (not just a possibility) for individual Member States to take a lead in tightening rules aimed at protecting health, the environment and consumer interests."
"I have decided to emphasize this because it is so important."
"I hope this important principle will also have an impact on other EU rules."
"Certain shared minimum standards are certainly justified, but to forbid Member States from taking a lead and adopting better rules out of consideration for freedom of movement is a manifestation of the worst side of the EU."
"I therefore hope Parliament adopts this report and that it also has an effect on the EU's official policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, over the last few months I have discussed legislation on foodstuffs with people from a wide range of areas and Member States, and have been unable to find anyone who could see why chicory extracts should be covered by a vertical directive with a different legal basis as compared with jams or fruit juices or sugars."
"So I think we need to look at the legal basis a lot more closely than just simply saying that these are products derived from primary agricultural products."
"Processing is indeed involved and there is also a supra-regional aspect to this, which recently emerged in the debate in committee on added vitamins, and which needs to be examined in much more detail within the Commission."
"I do not think we can allow vitamins to be added to fruit juices or milk products, or even jams, without consumers being given adequate information, nor should there be different arrangements in the individual Member States, because I am sure this has got nothing to do with regional customs or local specialities."
"I would like to make a few more points about honey."
"For one thing, we must not forget that honey is a natural food and it should therefore be analysed in the same way throughout the Union. Furthermore, the directive should refer to the fact that honey does not just consist of various sugars, chiefly glucose and fructose."
"It is possible to create imitation honey using these two sugars, but it would not be the same honey that bee-keepers get from bees."
"Beekeepers' work should be highly rated in the European Union, not only because they are involved with honey production, but also - and I think that Mrs Lulling will have more to say about this - because bee-keepers make an important contribution to preserving nature, and to growing the fruit that we enjoy so much in fruit juices and jams, which would not be possible without bees."
"Mr President, the European Union pays for expensive two-page advertisements in magazines, in which it extols the virtues of quality honey marked with an EU Member State as its place of origin. The advert features the question: ' Do you treat honey with as much respect as Saint Ambrose did?' ."
"Unfortunately, in preparing the proposal before us today, which is intended to simplify the directive on honey, the Commission has not followed the advice which it has spent so much money on giving to consumers in its adverts in glossy magazines."
"Mr Bangemann, your proposals do not accord honey, a natural product, the respect it deserves."
"I am very grateful to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and its rapporteur, Mr Lannoye, for incorporating in its report the many amendments which I submitted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The main thing is that the honey produced in our Member States, a highly nutritious agricultural product, should be protected against lower quality cheap imported honey, and it should therefore most definitely be compulsory to state on the label whether the honey is produced in the Union or in a third country."
"Unfortunately, in some Member States there is honey on the market which is up to 80 % adulterated. Furthermore, honey filtering, which destroys genetic fingerprints so that its regional origin can no longer be identified, should be absolutely banned."
"We should be listening to the bee-keepers, not the bottling lobby, to make sure that as many bee-keepers as possible are prepared to produce high-quality honey despite the much higher costs involved."
"This should also ensure, as I have always preached in my reports on bee-keeping in Europe, that the European Union will have enough bees, which pollinate over 80, 000 different plant varieties."
"I consider it essential that our amendments should be accepted."
"They mean that the statement of origin would make it clear that the honey does not just meet a fair number of the quality requirements, but the majority of them."
"I have run out of time now and will say the rest when we vote."
"Mr President, whenever we discuss food regulations in this House, we end up having to decide what compromises to agree upon."
"No doubt that also applies to national parliaments."
"I have the impression that we have forgotten something. I mean, we should remember that for thousands of years humanity managed without chemical additives."
"It seems, and the debate here has confirmed this, that we have lost something - respect for food."
"I have in mind genetic engineering in particular: it seems that we feel we have to play God."
"The second point is that food production, and above all production of high and superior quality food, is all about jobs - not just in agriculture, but also in retailing."
"This applies especially to remote regions with little tourism."
"That is why it is important that the Member States should have the option of giving individual regions special designations, and thus apply a higher quality standard than the general European standard prescribed by the Directive."
"It should go without saying that consumers should be able to see all the additives in a product, as well as its geographical origin, both of which must be clearly and unmistakably labelled."
"We owe this not only to consumers, but also to those producers who rely on producing quality products which are naturally somewhat more expensive than mass-produced food."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0001/98)."
"As the author is not present, Question No 44 lapses."
"Question No 45 by Clive Needle (H-0988/97)"
"Subject: Funding HIV/AIDS therapy in developing countries"
"Could the Commission state its position on recent proposals made by a Member State Health Minister at a conference in Côte d'Ivoire in December 1997, to establish a ""fund for pharmaceutical drugs for people with HIV/AIDS in developing countries' ?"
"Does the Commission agree that such a politically ""fashionable' but potentially disastrous idea has no place in the excellent EU policy guidelines on HIV/AIDS in developing countries, which were recently presented to the European Parliament by Commissioner Pinheiro?"
"Can the Commission provide Members with a clear guarantee that no EU support to this scheme will be considered without a detailed analysis of its implications and that the outcome of such an analysis should be put before the European Parliament?"
"Mr President, before answering the question, as this is the first time I have attended Parliament in 1998, allow me to wish all Members a prosperous year."
"The recent proposals submitted by a Member State during the Abidjan Conference on Aids held in December 1997 on setting up a fund to improve access to treatment for persons contaminated with the HIV/Aids virus in developing countries have the merit of starting a discussion on a real problem."
"In fact, at the moment there is an obvious lack of justice between taking responsibility for Aids sufferers in northern countries, where anti-retrovirus medicines are available, and, at the other extreme, in the southern countries, where most sufferers do not have access to basic health care."
"However, setting up a fund of this type raises a series of very important questions that need to be answered."
"According to the request put forward by the European Council in Luxembourg last December, the Commission's services are going to study ways of setting up a treatment solidarity fund under the aegis of the Aids-UN, intended to combat Aids in the developing countries."
"The results of this study should examine the various scenarios possible and the respective consequences, as regards both ethics and fairness, and at technical, economic and financial levels."
"I wish to assure the honourable Member that the results of this study will be communicated to the European Parliament."
"I would add that in my opinion setting up a fund of this type raises three fundamental questions."
"The first question is that of the size and access to this fund, taking into account the annual cost of treatment for tri-therapy, which is estimated at $10, 000 - $20, 000."
"The choice of sufferers inevitably raises ethical problems and problems of not discriminating between persons contaminated by the Aids virus."
"A second question relates to the ways of gaining access to the treatment, to the extent that there is a real danger in setting up a parallel system aimed solely at Aids sufferers, which would be ineffective and onerous at the same time, and could prove counterproductive for other sufferers with malaria, tuberculosis, measles, and so on."
"The third question to be answered is the fact that the long-term efficacy of anti-retrovirus medicines has not yet been fully proven."
"Beyond that, the necessary accompanying measures for anti-retrovirus therapy still do not exist in most African countries, such as the provision of laboratories and training for medical and paramedical staff."
"For all these reasons, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we await this study that the Commission is going to undertake with some prudence as to the conclusions that might be drawn."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, and can I join Commissioner Pinheiro in wishing you and he both a happy New Year."
"Can I also thank the Commissioner for what was a very good and full response to that question which went a long way towards meeting the reasons for which it was tabled."
"There is concern amongst non-governmental organizations as well as several Members, and we will be partially reassured by your answer about the study."
"We certainly look forward to the report returning to Parliament."
"I think you are right to be cautious about sudden initiatives of this sort however worthy or well-intentioned and however massive we all know the scale of the problems are."
"Can I just briefly ask you: would you further agree that the question here is not whether people in developing countries should have equal access to HIV/Aids treatment as people in developed countries - everybody agrees that is necessary - but how to achieve that end?"
"As it stands, the vertical approach in favour of people with Aids as proposed by one of our Member States could seriously jeopardize existing public health systems by creating parallel systems."
"That would arguably benefit developed world pharmaceutical companies and shift the emphasis from prevention to treatment."
"I wonder, do you see that as being something that the study will give us a clear response on?"
"I would just like to stress that broadly speaking the Commission always suggests in regard to the health sector or the health situation in developing countries that we should strive for what we call a horizontal approach."
"We try to reinforce the system itself, the training of doctors and other health personnel, to try to develop a flow of medicaments based on the ownership of the country, and so on and so forth."
"Perhaps HIV/Aids is the only exception to this approach, mainly because of its relationship with certain types of behaviour."
"A recent study undertaken by the Commission, the United Nations and the World Bank found a clear correlation between sexually-transmitted diseases and the transmission of the HIV virus."
"That means that education and prevention are perhaps the best way in which to try to reduce the incidence of the disease, at least in Africa."
"For all these reasons, we hope that the study which the Commission will undertake together with experts from the Member States and other countries that might help us will be of great assistance either to formulate a new strategy or to confirm the one we have been following."
"One thing is certain: if you take into account the current costs of treating a patient of $10, 000 - $20, 000 this would mean, if I am not mistaken, something like over $100 million per year just for this which is obviously outside our capacity."
"Thank you Commissioner for your response, and a happy New Year to you in the eleven working languages of the European Union."
"First of all, can I say that both Mr Needle and myself submitted similar questions to the Council and the Council grouped them together."
"It is strange that the Commission has not done the same."
"However, coming back to this fund, Commissioner, if such a fund were to be established, would it be new money?"
"Because if it is not new money then it is difficult to imagine how it could possibly function without displacing existing funding to equally essential projects."
"I would certainly look forward to the study and I hope that it will address this point."
"Can you tell me, will it be new money if such a fund is established?"
"As far as I know, the fresh money would come from Member States since the Commission budget is well defined, and unless the Members of this House decide that we should have extra funds, there will be no new money available."
"At any rate, responses from political leaders in the Member States indicate that they are prepared to put some new money into this fund."
"However, at this stage I think it is premature to draw conclusions on whether the fund will be established, its dimensions and the way in which it would function."
"I tried to say this in my answer to Mr Needle."
"Question No 46 by John Cushnahan (H-1018/97)"
"Subject: Single market"
"What measures is the Commission considering to ensure that there is no further disruption of the single market in light of the recent Court of Justice ruling against the French Government and the recent beef blockade of UK ports?"
"Mr President, on 18 November the Commission adopted a draft Council regulation that established a mechanism for Commission intervention to abolish certain obstacles to trade."
"This draft answers a request made by the European Council in Amsterdam last June, recording its conclusions on the action plan for the single market."
"This draft also answers the concern expressed by the honourable Member in his question as to the follow-up the Commission intends to give to the judgment passed by the Court of Justice on 9 December in the Commission vs. France proceedings."
"According to the proposed intervention mechanism, the Commission will ask the Member State in question, by means of a decision, to take the necessary measures to end an obvious, classified and unjustified obstruction to the acceptance of Articles 30 and 36 of the Treaty, seriously hampering the freedom of movement of goods in the internal market."
"I would add that, based on past experience, the cases most representative of this situation might be, for example: the untimely and unjustified prohibition of importing products from other Member States; measures establishing or restoring import formalities, such as licences or technical approvals; destruction of large quantities of products from other Member States, for example, on the roads, in shopping centres or in warehouses; or even the immobilization of products by not permitting access to the national territory or movement within it, for example, blockading means of transport at the borders, on the motorways, or at the ports or airports."
"By making a decision, if Council approves this regulation, Commission intervention gives binding power and has immediate effects on the legal system of the Member State in question, enabling individuals with grievances immediately to assert the rights they feel they are being denied."
"That, Mr President, is the answer I would like to give the honourable Member."
"I should like to respond to the Commissioner's good wishes by wishing him and his colleagues, especially my Irish colleague, Commissioner Flynn and the President of Parliament a happy New Year."
"I think you would acknowledge, Commissioner, that the Court of Justice decision against the French Government was a landmark decision which will help you pursue the policy you agreed at the Amsterdam Summit."
"I want to ask you a number of questions relating to that."
"First, can we have an assurance that when there is any further disruption to the single market, the Commission will act urgently and swiftly to ensure that Member States discharge their obligations to ensure that the single market is not disrupted."
"Secondly, what action did the Commission take in making its views known to the UK Government regarding the recent illegal blockade of UK ports which affected Irish farmers, hauliers and exporters?"
"Thirdly, what action will the Commission take to ensure that compensation will be forthcoming to Irish farmers, hauliers and exporters who suffered a great deal because of this illegal action?"
"With regard to whether the Commission will act swiftly, that is the objective of the regulation we propose."
"If we were to follow traditional procedures, it would take such a long time that some foodstuffs would be totally lost."
"With regard to events that have occurred in the past, I should like to differentiate between two situations."
"The first is where there is a blockade but where the Member State does its utmost to eliminate the blockade."
"Then there is no need for the Commission to act."
"The second is when there is difficulty in fulfilling the terms of the single market due either to the failure of a government to act or to the deliberate action of a government."
"It is in the latter type of case that the Commission acts"
"With regard to compensation, it is implicit in what I said that compensation should be applied for by private individuals who feel their goods have been destroyed, or whatever."
"Thus - if the Council approves our proposal - the fact that a decision has been taken will allow private interests to be directly sustained in court."
"It will enter into immediate legal effect in the Member State concerned."
"So, compensation is not a matter for the Commission but for the competent authorities in a Member State, and it is they who are required to act."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the proposal for this directive the Commission has drafted has raised some eyebrows in Finland, because it is seen as restricting workers' right to strike."
"The issue here is not only making the common market work perfectly, but also the right of the citizen to strike, which is held as sacred in my country, Finland."
"I would respectfully ask the Commission this question: are you endeavouring to have a person's right to strike eclipsed by the needs of the common market, and do you intend to do so without consulting the trade union movement and in total disregard for the tripartite system - as we call it - of industrial negotiations?"
"Mr President, I would like to say that, for the Commission too, the right to strike is inalienable and that under no circumstances could the Commission permit any exception to a fundamental right held by the workers in a democratic state, on account of the single market."
"For that reason, I can specifically say that under no circumstances will the right to strike be affected by this regulation, or any other regulation derived from it, for similar reasons."
"Question No 47 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H-0977/97)"
"Subject: Blood transfusions"
"According to press reports throughout Europe, there are fundamental suspicions that Creutzfeld-Jakob disease affecting humans is transmitted through blood and blood products."
"Will the Commission say whether the Member States test blood used for transfusions and which Member States carry out those tests?"
"Will the Commission immediately propose the compulsory testing of blood to be used in transfusions in all the Member States?"
"Before I specifically address the issue of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), I want to inform the honourable Member that Member States do screen blood and plasma for a variety of pathogens."
"A recent survey conducted by the Commission on the regulation and practices in the Member States of the European Community as regards the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of their donations confirms that all Member States routinely screen for antibodies against the hepatitis C virus, the human immunodeficiency virus type I and II and the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus."
"With regard to the increased concern that blood and blood products may transmit the agent responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a distinction first has to be made between classical or sporadic CJD and the new variant of this disease, nvCJD, which has been strongly associated with BSE."
"From studies so far undertaken, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, there is no evidence of transmission to patients of the agent responsible for classical or sporadic CJD by blood or blood products."
"The advice that has been given to the Commission from the relevant scientific committees, in particular the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, on the risk of these forms of CJD, is that there are no specific grounds for possible recall or quarantine of batches of plasma-derived products."
"However, this issue will be re-evaluated at regular intervals, depending on the availability of epidemiological data and their scientific evaluation."
"As regards nvCJD, there are indeed concerns that a new and additional risk may be posed by blood and blood products prepared from donations from infected donors."
"Because of these concerns and as a precautionary measure, the CPMP has advised that batches of plasma-derived medicinal products should be withdrawn from the market when a donor to a plasma pool subsequently has been confirmed diagnosed as nvCJD."
"Member States are already in the process of complying with this advice."
"The United Kingdom also follows the advice of its Spongiform Encephalopathy Committee in this respect."
"Moreover, a rapid alert defective product recall procedure is in place in the Community."
"In the United Kingdom a risk assessment has been initiated to ascertain the possible transmission of nvCJD through blood transfusion."
"This is being carried out in parallel with an appraisal of the operational and scientific aspects of introducing leucodepletion removal of the white blood cells."
"With regard to the compulsory testing of blood for nvCJD, I am sure that the honourable Member is aware that at present no screening test exists."
"Scientists and industry are currently working to develop such screening and diagnostic tests."
"Members of the European Parliament will be interested to learn that an ad hoc specialist workshop on nvCJD will be held on 15 January under the auspices of the CPMP."
"This workshop, which will bring together experts in this area, will focus on the infectivity distribution between new variant and classical CJD, the risk of transmission by blood and blood fractions, a review of the published and ongoing work, and the identification of any new studies required."
"A report of the meeting will be forthcoming."
"The Commission is seeking advice from the Scientific Steering Committee and the Scientific Committee for Medicinal Products, and has already presented a proposal for a Council recommendation on the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of donated blood in the European Community, which seeks to establish a requirement of permanent deferral for persons in whose family CJD has occurred."
"In the light of the results of ongoing evaluations and assessments and the advice received, the Commission will give consideration to proposing measures specific to nvCJD, concerning blood and plasma as source materials for medicinal products."
"As regards blood for transfusion, however, there is, at present, no legal basis on which binding requirements can be laid down at Community level."
"I hope that this unsatisfactory situation will change with the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and Article 152, in particular."
"I am sorry for taking so long, but this is a very sensitive and very important issue."
"I wanted to give as full a reply as possible."
"Mr President, I should like to wish a happy New Year to you and to Commissioners de Silguy and Flynn."
"I should also like to wish for good health for you and all the citizens of Europe."
"But you know, for there to be health, wishes and good intentions are not enough: specific measures are also needed."
"Thank you very much for your answer, Mr Commissioner, which indeed was very full."
"I would just like to remind you that in 1980 there were simply suspicions, as there are suspicions now, that the AIDS virus was transmitted by blood and blood transfusions."
"We did not take then the necessary measures that we should have taken. We took them in 1993."
"We are all unfortunately aware of the results of this three-year delay."
"This then is my fear."
"Moreover I am telling you this as a doctor: although there are only suspicions, as indeed you said, I would prefer that the necessary measures be taken now, which may in the future prove to have been unnecessary, rather then allow to happen what happened with AIDS, when it will be far too late."
"I appreciate the honourable Member's good wishes to the Commissioner."
"I have to say to you that, yes, this is a matter that receives our considerable and considered opinion at all times."
"We are, of course, as you know, entirely bound by the scientific evidence available to us at any particular time."
"But, certainly, preventive measures are being considered and being put in place in the Member States."
"We are talking here about the donors, the question of screening, evaluation and testing and also the question of research and diagnostic tests."
"All of the matters that would give you concern are being taken on board on a continuing basis, and that is the reason why we are having this very special meeting on 15 January, which will bring all that information together to enable us to do whatever is necessary on the good advice of that committee."
"I, too, would like to express my appreciation of the proposal which is on the Council's table and to which the Commissioner referred."
"I have studied this recommendation and understand that through it we shall obtain a ban on people who suffer from this illness being allowed to give blood."
"When does the Commissioner think this recommendation is going to be adopted by the Council, and how did the discussion go at the Council's meeting in November when, according to reports, this question was discussed?"
"I also wonder whether the Commission has any estimate of how much risk blood has been found on the European market, blood which must now be withdrawn."
"Is the Commission convinced that all risk blood has been withdrawn?"
"Thank you, Mrs Thors, I am pleased that you support the meeting that is to take place on 15 January under the auspices of the CPMP."
"This will be a very valuable workshop that will bring together the experts in the area and will focus particularly on the infectivity distribution, and that will include tissue distribution, between the new variant and classical CJD."
"I should also like to say that, yes, there is an amount of risk blood - no question about that."
"Our understanding is that it is quite limited."
"The Commission is only able to intervene directly for medicinal products that have received a Community marketing authorization through the centralized procedure."
"No medicinal products derived from blood or plasma have received such authorization to date."
"The situation is different so far as decentralized procedures are concerned."
"There we act under Article 12 of 75/3/90/EEC, whereby we can propose, via the comitology procedure, a decision to withdraw the marketing authorization and therefore withdraw the product."
"With regard to the products you mentioned that are implicated with nvCJD, the CPMP has discussed this and it has recommended that batches of implicated products still on the shelf be withdrawn."
"That has happened."
"The vehicle is there in the decentralized procedure but as yet no licences have been granted through the centralized procedure."
"Question No 48 by Sören Wibe (H-0964/97)"
"Subject: Stability Pact budget balance requirement"
"The Stability Pact contains a requirement that budgets should balance over the economic cycle."
"Does this requirement relate to real or nominal balance?"
"Has the Commission taken into account the impact on employment, for instance, of the real squeeze on demand which is bound to result from requiring nominal financial balance in the Member States?"
"Mr de Silguy, you now have the floor, and may I wish you a happy New Year."
"Thank you, Mr President, I take advantage of this opportunity in my turn to express to you and your colleagues, for both yourselves and your families, my best wishes for health, happiness and success."
"The Commission thanks Mr Wibe for the opportunity he has given us once again to specify the content and meaning of the Stability Pact."
"The Stability Pact, approved by your Parliament, is neither more nor less than the translation of the provisions of the Treaty of the European Union."
"It is in a manner of speaking the internal regulations of the euro zone."
"Adopted by all the Member States, its aim is to ensure the proper operation of economic and monetary union, by specifying the operational procedures of Article 103 and Article 104c of the Treaty."
"I would add that it is also a credibility factor for the euro."
"In order to re-establish the margins of budgetary manoeuvre in the Member States, this Pact invites Member States, and I quote: ' to respect the medium-term objective of a budget which is close to being balanced or in surplus.'"
"The Stability Pact therefore does not make mandatory any extra constraint."
"It sets an objective."
"This is of course a balanced budget or budget in surplus, in the meaning of the national accounts, that is, a balance expressed as a percentage of GDP, and therefore calculated on the basis of nominal magnitudes."
"This objective was accepted by the Heads of State and Government for the purposes of, I quote 'reinforcing the conditions favourable to sustained growth in production and employment.'"
"Indeed, the search for medium-term national budgetary balance can only have positive consequences for employment."
"Only healthy budget situations are of such a nature as to promote sustainable growth, and hence the creation of significant employment."
"The creation of healthy public finances is a prior condition for benefiting from low interest rates, which favour investment, and hence growth and the creation of employment."
"I would add that Europe has got its public finances into better shape in the years after 1993, and it is beginning to reap the real rewards of that effort."
"The figures themselves provide a cold illustration of that reality: in 1996 the deficit was -4.2 %, and growth 1.8 %, while in 1997 the deficit was -2.6 %, and growth 2.6 %."
"The forecast for 1998 is deficit of under -2 % - and the deficit is continuing to shrink - and growth of more than 3 %, and it is continuing to increase."
"I would add that according to Commission forecasts, Europe will be creating four million jobs in the three years between 1997 and 1999."
"Let me start like everyone else by wishing everyone a happy New Year and thanking the Commissioner for his reply."
"I asked this question to find out whether you have discussed this difference between a real deficit and a nominal deficit."
"A real deficit is the budget deficit plus the change in the State's capital position. In other words, if a country has, let us say, a national debt of 150 % of GNP and a two % international inflation, or inflation in the currencies in which the national debt is placed, that means that, even though the budget is balanced, in reality there is a squeeze, a real saving."
"That means, Commissioner de Silguy, that if we have a requirement for a nominal budget balance and the countries have a national debt, and we assume that we have inflation which is nominally at 1 %-3 %, the requirements of the stability pact will lead to a real squeeze on demand."
"In spite of Commissioner de Silguy's optimism that this will create employment, do you not agree even so that a real squeeze on demand leads to reduced production and increased unemployment?"
"No, I do not think so."
"I believe the experience of these last ten or fifteen years proves the contrary."
"When the public deficit reaches excessively high levels - and above 3 % it is excessive - we witness firstly a significant increase in the level of debt, and secondly a rise in interest rates."
"I shall take a clear and simple example."
"When we note that some eighteen months or one year ago in Europe, 50 % of household savings was being used to finance public deficits, you have to come to the conclusion that savings would be better employed in financing productive investment."
"Consequently, the reduction of public deficits must mean that savings are released for productive investment, and that internal demand will benefit by this, in terms of either investment or consumption, and at the very least in the purchase of semi-durable goods."
"Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of employment since I think it is a fact that the policies are deflationary, and we should take heed of the United States which is talking of the danger - not of inflation or overheating - but of the freezing of the economy, and I do not know where EMU is taking us in today's conditions."
"However, on the subject of employment, I would like to say that here in Strasbourg, New Year's Eve was celebrated with deeds of desperation by tens of hundreds of young people."
"And today in Greece the main news item is the suicide of someone, 60 years old, who left a note which said ""I am committing suicide because I am unemployed' ."
"And from this standpoint I would like to ask: within the framework of this explosion of new data on unemployment in Germany, of suicides, of the aggressive behaviour of young people who are in despair, are there any new deliberations in the Commission?"
"I am convinced that the euro will create an economic framework which will generate more growth and hence more employment in Europe."
"I am furthermore perfectly aware that the euro will not solve the problem of unemployment, and that this means we have to attack its deep roots, which arise from a whole series of reasons and causes with which you are familiar."
"In the final analysis, 1997 enabled us to make a breakthrough, at least at the conceptual level."
"The November European Council in Luxembourg set up a new method."
"I believe that this method, which is target-based, is a method based on objectives, and one that we can place our hopes in."
"We shall be jointly fixing a number of concrete objectives at the European level, for example that within five years, there should not be any young person who, after six months of leaving a university or school system, is out of a job."
"That is an objective fixed at the Community level."
"Then, each of the Member States should, in the light of its own special features, traditions and rules, implement and propose plans for how to reach this objective and then, once a year, at head of state and government level, an assessment should be made, and multilateral supervision be exercised."
"At this stage, the governments will have to answer for their actions before public opinion, before their partners, to see whether or not they have reached their objectives."
"Therefore, I believe it is necessary to attack the problem of unemployment by in-depth reforms, which are not directed against the employees, but carried out along with them."
"For this reason, social dialogue is an important factor in the long-term success of the fight against unemployment."
"Commissioner, do you consider that the ASEAN crisis will affect the budget balancing process?"
"Question No 49 by Tommy Waidelich (H-0968/97)"
"Subject: EMU"
"It was decided at the most recent summit meeting in Luxembourg that Member States not participating in the third stage of EMU will be able to take part in meetings of the Euro-X committee (Eurocouncil), except when issues relating directly to the euro are being discussed."
"Will the Commission explain what sort of issues are meant?"
"The Eurocouncil was effectively set up by Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Luxembourg last December."
"Ministers of states participating in the euro zone can meet among themselves in an informal manner to discuss questions relating to the specific responsibilities which they share in the field of the single currency."
"These are questions relating to the common management of the single currency on a basis of solidarity, provided they involve only the euro states."
"Examples would be the euro exchange rate, dissuasive aspects (that is to say, sanctions under the Stability Pact), or the preparation for readjustments within the new European monetary system."
"But these are only examples."
"Additionally, in line with the wish expressed by your Parliament, the Commission will participate in all the meetings of the Eurocouncil and, as the case may be, the European Central Bank may be invited to these meetings."
"As the honourable Member has noted, the Heads of State and Government nevertheless specified that 'each time questions of common interest are concerned, they will be discussed by ministers of all the Member States.'"
"I believe that questions relating to the coordination of economic policy, questions relating to the major orientations of economic policy, should be discussed by the fifteen Member States."
"The same applies to everything relating to the single market, tax harmonization or social problems."
"Furthermore - and this is essential - the European Council drew attention to the fact that the Ecofin Council, the Council of the finance ministers of the fifteen Member States, unlike the Eurocouncil, is the only body with the authority to take decisions according to the rules and procedures laid down under theTreaty."
"The central role which the Ecofin Council is called on to play - at the express request of the European Council, with the support of the Commission and on the Commission's proposal - this role is the consecration of the unity and cohesion of the Community in the economic field."
"I would like to thank you for your reply."
"I shall do no less than everyone else and also wish everyone a happy New Year, not least the Commissioner."
"We all have an exciting year ahead of us, now that we are going to launch the euro, and the Commissioner is going to be very much involved in that."
"I am one of those Swedish parliamentarians who are very positive about this event, that we are now getting a euro, and can have the chance to prevent currency speculation, and through that actually get more independence for countries to conduct an economic policy under the protection of the euro."
"In the reply we also found out that a lot will depend on informal meetings in the so-called Eurocouncil."
"That means, if I understand correctly, that there are no formal discussions about majority decisions and such."
"The Commissioner could confirm whether that is the case."
"I would just like this Eurocouncil to develop into a forum where there could be a more political counterbalance against the European Central Bank, more democratic control, and also a coordination of economic policy."
"Thank you for your good wishes, which I also accept on behalf of the success of the launch of the euro."
"What I can assure you is that we are sparing no effort at present to ensure the success of this operation."
"Yes, the Eurocouncil is a useful body, insofar as we can never talk together enough."
"We have a common monetary policy, a federal policy (let us use the right words) and faced with that, we have national economic policy which remains subject to national competency."
"It is therefore necessary to reinforce our coordination and common action."
"Hence the interest of ensuring more contacts between finance ministers."
"However, all that does not mean that we should overturn the balance of the Treaty."
"I believe that the Eurocouncil will be useful for awareness-raising and analysis purposes, but we shall have to be very careful (and the Commission will itself be careful with regard to its own concerns) that all the powers laid down in the Treaty, under the conditions set out in the Treaty - that is, Commission proposal, advice from the European Council, Council decision - that these powers should be exercised within the bodies laid down for that purpose by the Treaty, that is to say, the Ecofin Council."
"I also join in the goodwill wishes for the New Year expressed by previous speakers."
"Like Mr Waidelich, I am among those in Sweden who are very positive about the introduction of the euro and hope that all of this very difficult process will go well."
"When this Eurocouncil is formed, it is natural that it is the countries participating in EMU which also participate in this council and in the informal meetings."
"However, those countries which have decided to remain outside could still have an interest in being informed about what is happening and the Eurocouncil's meetings."
"Are there any thoughts about how the few countries which remain outside EMU, when it is implemented, are going to be kept informed?"
"Firstly, Mr Andersson, since you are a euro supporter from a country which has expressed a desire, at present, not to be a part of the euro, allow me to give you two arguments and two avenues of reflection which might well be usefully pursued in your country."
"Do you reasonably believe that a country which is not part of the euro could conduct monetary policy which is totally independent of the euro zone, which by definition will be something extremely powerful?"
"Personally I do not believe that there can be any question on this point, because it means that, as part of the euro, one is obliged to follow monetary policy, but without having taken part in its definition."
"The second area for reflection is enterprise."
"Even if the national administrations of countries outside the euro allow them to work in euros, will they nevertheless not have to bear extra costs?"
"Indeed, in one way or another somebody will have to bear the costs of the foreign exchange risk between any euro and non-euro currency."
"This foreign exchange risk will disappear for countries within the euro, and hence (and this applies to both banks and businesses) they will no longer need to invoice for that."
"The problem, it appears to me, remains wholly outstanding for the non-euro countries. However, Mr Andersson, these are just two ideas or two avenues of reflection which, in my view, would merit further examination."
"To give a precise answer to your question, I would say that while this organ is clearly informal, it is nevertheless a fact that its work must be transparent."
"The presence of the Commission and the fact that the decision-making body will be the Ecofin Council, provide every guarantee that information will be given in a transparent manner in all the European countries, whether or not they have joined up to the euro."
"Nobody can prevent the euro countries discussing things among themselves. But even so, the interest of this European Council resolution is that the discussion is kept within the framework of a procedure and within a system which make it possible both to ensure transparency and to guarantee the unity of the European Union"
"Question No 50 by Jan Andersson (H-0970/97)"
"Subject: Prospects for establishing more criteria for economic and monetary cooperation"
"At present, economic and monetary cooperation is entirely geared towards achieving price stability."
"However, many ideas concerning the possibility of introducing other criteria have been put forward during the debate on the future development of EMU."
"One such criterion under discussion, and one which deserves serious consideration, is growth."
"What prospects does the Commission see for making growth a criterion for economic and monetary cooperation?"
"Mr Andersson's question provides an opportunity to dissipate misconceptions regarding criteria, means and objectives, which must be regarded as different concepts."
"Indeed, there are criteria, for the achievement and proper operation of economic and monetary union."
"And there are objectives and means, for the coordination of economic policy."
"The criteria for passing into economic and monetary union are defined in Article 109j of the Treaty of the European Union."
"I would remind you that those criteria must enable the Commission and the Council to check whether, and I quote: ' a high degree of sustainable convergence has been achieved between the various Member States '."
"Among these criteria is included, I quote: ' the achievement of a high degree of price stability.'"
"This is also the principal mission assigned to the European system of central banks."
"This is Article 105 of the Treaty, and this article lays down, and I quote: ' the principal objective of the European system of central banks is to maintain price stability."
"Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the European system of central banks provides support to the general and economic policies of the Community, with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objective of the Community, as defined in Article 2.'"
"Well, what does Article 2 say?"
"'Among such objectives' , and I am still quoting, ' are sustainable and noninflationary growth.'"
"Growth cannot be decreed."
"It is the result of economic policy, and is necessary if there is to be substantial job creation."
"Employment policy is furthermore the priority policy of the European Union."
"However, price stability is essential to ensure the sustainable nature of growth, and hence a high level of social protection."
"The best proof of that is the return to growth in Europe, which has gone hand in hand with the reduction of inflation."
"I remind you that in 1996, we had 2.6 % inflation and a growth rate of 1.8 %."
"In 1997, inflation fell to 2.1 %, the growth rate rose to 2.6 %, and inflation should broadly remain stable in 1998, with growth rising to 3 %."
"The social partners have fully understood this strategy and they support it; witness their repeated joint statements, in particular those that they issued at the last European Council."
"It is therefore not envisaged, under such conditions, that these very satisfactory criteria should be modified."
"Only sustained growth and controlled inflation will provide an appropriate framework for job creation, notwithstanding that the fight against unemployment requires the introduction of other measures of a more fundamental, I might say more structural, nature."
"This is the way opened by the European Council in Luxembourg in November, and which I mentioned earlier in response to a previous question."
"Let me first comment on what the Commissioner said in connection with my previous speech, namely that countries outside EMU cannot conduct an independent monetary policy. I share that view."
"It is a fallacy to believe that you can conduct an independent monetary policy outside."
"I also share the view that companies in countries which are outside EMU are, of course, dependent on what happens within the euro zone."
"There is, of course, still criticism of EMU, and it has weak popular support in Europe."
"That cannot be ignored."
"One of the reasons for this is that at the same time as EMU is to be implemented our unemployment is much too high."
"You cannot ignore the fact that a role may have been played by the fact that there has been an overriding goal of creating price stability which has been placed above all other goals."
"I would like there to be more balance between price stability and growth."
"I am not against price stability - on the contrary."
"But the balance between growth targets and price stability targets should be better."
"Very quickly, my answer is that as far as I am concerned, the convergence criteria or stability criteria are not obstacles to growth."
"On the contrary, they are so many supports for and means to growth, an economic growth we wish to be rich in job-creation opportunities."
"Public opinion in Europe will not accept the new process, the new events, if it is not explained to them."
"I believe that a very substantial explanation effort must be planned."
"Secondly, there must be reassurance. For that reason it is essential that the fight against unemployment, which has become a priority within the European Council, within the Council of Ministers, should be given content as a policy and put into actual practice."
"This is what the European Council in Luxembourg committed itself to in November."
"Now the framework must be fleshed out."
"I think a promising avenue has opened up."
"It reflects the approach which was successfully used for economic and monetary union, an objective-based approach."
"We need to persevere down this road."
"Unlike the previous questioners, I belong to the critical part of the Swedish representation in Parliament as far as EMU is concerned."
"I ask why people cannot imagine developing criteria other than price stability. Employment has not been mentioned at all, while growth has been mentioned."
"The US Fed has all of these three criteria in its definition of what the Fed should be concerned with."
"The other week I took part in a hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, of which I am a member."
"It was a very interesting hearing in which precisely these questions were raised by the participating experts on the lack of balance in the European Central Bank - in other words, that price stability is the only thing that counts."
"The question which then also arose was the lack of democracy when we were not really sure who is in charge of the ECB."
"My question to you would be: can you say whether it is Parliament or the Council or someone else who is in charge of the ECB?"
"I will reply very quickly, Mr President, because I believe you are pressed for time, and we have overrun the time allocated to us."
"It was no surprise to me to hear what Mr Lindqvist said."
"I believe he is ferociously opposed to the euro, as he has every right to be."
"Under these conditions, you can understand that I cannot share his analysis."
"I wish only to note - as he cited the example of the United States - that the United States had set themselves the target of a balanced budget for the beginning of the next decade, and that from this year on they will be in equilibrium and probably in a budget surplus."
"This is another example which tends to show that there is no incompatibility between a balanced budget, growth and job creation."
"A second comment relates to the European Central Bank."
"You will, I imagine, be putting questions to the future directors of the European Central Bank at your leisure, as I know you will be auditioning them before they are formally appointed by the European Council."
"I think this would be a good opportunity for them to explain to you how they expect to conduct their monetary policy. But as things stand, I believe that the fight against inflation is a prior condition of growth."
"I agree with the Commissioner that good public finances and low interest rates are good for growth."
"I also believe that through currency stability the euro is good for growth and employment in the EU, particularly in the euro countries."
"However, I also believe people may need to consider other possibilities."
"I believe that a growth target, such as the Federal Reserve has in the United States, could be a way to proceed."
"I wonder whether I have interpreted the Commissioner correctly, and would like to ask the following: is it formally possible to add a growth criterion later if the heads of government are agreed on it?"
"Personally, I do not believe it is possible, in the medium or long-term, to contrast the policy of the Federal Bank in the United States with the policy of the Bundesbank in Germany."
"If you look at the figures over a period of 10, 15 or 20 years, you will see that in the final analysis their results are not very different, even if at certain times differences in appreciation may effectively appear."
"Secondly, growth cannot be a criterion in the meaning of the Treaty, because once again growth cannot be imposed by decree."
"Growth is the consequence of good economic policy."
"What we can say is that growth is an aim we pursue in conducting our economic policies, going hand in hand, at the heart of these policies, with employment."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"Since the allotted time for this series of questions has now expired, Questions Nos 51 to 55 will be dealt with in writing."
"I should like to remind the honourable Member of the Council's decision of 24 November 1997."
"It was decided then that the Commission's proposals on music promotion should be made within the context of the decision about the future of cultural action in Europe, which was adopted on 22 September 1997, and envisages the possibility of a single instrument for culture."
"Ever since culture was included in Article 128, some years ago, we have been conducting an experiment in this respect, by means of three programmes: Ariane, Kaleidoscope and Raphael."
"However, both Parliament and the Council have decided that this was probably an experimental route and that in the future it will be better to have an overall framework - a single framework for dealing with all cultural matters."
"Therefore, the proposals which the Commission is due to present shortly, which will pay special attention to music, will combine the various cultural and artistic sectors within this single framework, in accordance with the wishes of Parliament and the Council."
"As for employment within the cultural sphere, I would remind you that within the next few weeks the Commission will be presenting a Green Paper on culture, cultural industries and employment, which will refer specifically to music."
"The study is already at a very advanced stage, although it is not yet finished. However, I want to reassure Mrs Izquierdo Rojo that music will be given special attention."
"As regards Community assistance for music during the past few years, the honourable Member is welcome to consult the list which the Commission distributed for information purposes on the occasion of the European Parliament's hearing on that subject on 18 June."
"I should also like to remind you that the Commission thinks cooperative music projects can and should be assisted, but this should depend on how far they meet the criteria of the existing Community programmes and initiatives."
"For 1998, these consist of the Kaleidoscope programme and the call for proposals due to be published within the next few days from line B3-2003, entitled ""Community aid for cultural development projects' ."
"Bearing in mind also that the programmes and initiatives I have referred to are open to a wide variety of artistic disciplines, and that the cultural quality of the projects is one of the selection criteria, you will understand that the Commission is not able at this time to predict the amount of financial assistance which can be granted to this sector in 1998."
"However, the most important thing I want to remind you of, is that direct aid to Member States' orchestras experiencing financial difficulties is a matter for the Member States, as Mrs Izquierdo Rojo knows very well."
"The Member States are responsible for determining priorities for public assistance for musical institutions, while Community action is directed towards promoting cooperation between Member States, in accordance with Article 128 of the Treaty, and the principle of subsidiarity."
"Nevertheless, I want to mention the Community aid given to orchestras such as, for example, the European Youth Orchestra and the 'Orquestra Barroca' , through the Kaleidoscope programme."
"In other words, we do grant aid to those programmes and orchestras which involve all the different Member States."
"What is more, I personally think this type of aid should be boosted."
"I think the existence of this sort of orchestra, involving representatives of all the Member States, is highly symbolic."
"In the future, our thinking on music will become part of the framework programme on European cultural policy."
"I am taking this opportunity to draw special attention to this matter, because I think we must adopt a new approach, although what we have done so far will serve as a reference."
"We need to know exactly what we want to do with culture within the Community."
"That question has not yet been answered clearly, and there are still many uncertainties. We need a lot more debate, because some Member States think the Community's involvement in this area should be minimal."
"Other Member States have problems of a constitutional nature, by which their very constitution makes it difficult for their culture to be dealt with on a Community basis."
"For that reason, I think both Parliament and the Council have shown very good judgement. The Commission is convinced too, and we are going to prepare that great framework programme, that great cultural programme, right away."
"That is where music comes in."
"To that effect, we are going to hold a forum on 29 and 30 September, at which Parliament will be represented to a very significant extent."
"Every two or three weeks I meet a group of representatives from the world of music, and from other cultural spheres. For example, Mr Gutiérrez Aragón is one of the many people who have attended these meetings."
"I have met about a dozen people each time, representing all the different countries."
"The main purpose is to receive encouragement, and to find out what the people of Europe think can be done in the cultural sphere."
"The result of these meetings will allow us to prepare the document the Council has asked us for, and which Parliament also wants, which we must present before 1 May."
"Therefore, we have a lot of work to do before then, and you can of course rest assured, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, that we are going to pay a great deal of attention to what cultural activity means - including, obviously, the world of music - and to what extent it can contribute to job creation."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for his long answer, which was so positive and encouraging."
"I would be even more reassured if, in view of the inadequacy of the policy implemented so far, we could pay special attention to the innovative aspects. Subsidiarity must not be a hindrance in the next stage."
"I would like to ask whether, in order to reach those prestigious orchestras which have not yet received sufficient assistance, you envisage setting up agreements with different bodies to make sure that subsidiarity itself does not prevent us from attaining that objective, through lack of musical culture. The problem is that what we have done so far is no good, because it has not managed to promote music."
"Exactly - I think we have to try those agreements."
"What I would like to ask of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, whose sensitivity on these matters is well known, is that she should contribute any ideas she may have on the subject, since now is the time to try to put them into effect."
"We are going to start writing the draft on 1 February, so until then we are keen to hear suggestions, especially about our planned forum."
"We do not want the Commission to succumb to the temptation of locking itself away in an office to prepare this draft."
"We do not want it done like that."
"That is not the right way to work on anything, but especially not on culture."
"Therefore, we want to talk to actors, creative people, poets, artists, parliamentarians and governments, so that we can get ideas from them all, within the context of that forum."
"You can also rest assured that before the formal presentation on 1 May, I will try to have a meeting with the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, so that we can exchange views on the matter."
"I think the question you have raised is important, and I would like to deal with it specifically and give precise solutions once we have sketched out the framework programme, which will be finally presented on 1 May."
"Commissioner, I would particularly like to thank you for your reply to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question."
"But I would like to ask two supplementary questions."
"Since I have been a Member of this Parliament, there has only been one notable success in the field of music."
"That was the European Year of Music, which took place following an initiative by Mr Hahn."
"It was a great success."
"Have you used that to prepare plans in readiness for 1 May?"
"My second point is this: I am deeply concerned about the decline in our folk music."
"Folk music is undeniably gradually being killed off by the various mass media."
"Will you be taking these very important points into account in your programme, and will you be promoting folk instruments by supporting this music?"
"This is very important for the future!"
"Mr von Habsburg, the folk music you mention is something I particularly care about."
"In fact, I think Europe's rich diversity is one of our most characteristic features."
"What is Europe, after all? What is European unity?"
"It is the sum total of the diversity of its different peoples, traditions, life-styles and customs."
"That is the big difference between Europe and that melting pot, the United States."
"The basic difference is that we must safeguard our rich diversity."
"Music and popular songs are, of course, part of that diversity and must be safeguarded."
"As for the European Year of Music, I remember when that was launched. I was here at the time, but in a different capacity - in the Council of Europe."
"It was a great success, for the very reason that it did not just involve highbrow culture, but tried to promote respect for that cultural diversity."
"We will bear that in mind, and as regards the programme we are going to present on 1 May, I have taken note of the wish expressed here, which I absolutely agree with."
"Question No 57 by Hugh McMahon (H-1001/97)"
"Subject: Transmission of major sporting events by terrestrial television in the EU"
"Can the Commission inform Parliament of any progress made in discussions with Member States with a view to drawing up a list of major national and international sporting events, such as the Five Nations Rugby, the Open Golf and Wimbledon, which remain available to all EU citizens?"
"In the codecision procedure for the amendment of the ""Television without frontiers' directive, Parliament approved an amendment aimed at guaranteeing public access to specific sporting events of special importance through open-access television throughout the whole European Union."
"I had not included that in the draft directive."
"I presented a draft directive on 22 March 1995, and did not include a proposal on access to specific sporting events."
"Nevertheless, when I heard Parliament's idea of including the possibility of guaranteeing public access to such events, I thought it was interesting, and made a note of it immediately."
"Because agreement was not reached following the second reading, there was a conciliation phase, during which it was established - and I agreed - that it was not possible to obtain what could be termed a harmonized list of major events at Community level."
"It was important to acknowledge in some way the opinion of those in favour of open-access retransmissions of events, but some of us (myself included) thought it was impossible to have a harmonized list of events at Community level."
"For that reason, the new Directive contains provisions to guarantee that Member States can adopt measures to protect the right to information, and ensure wide public access to television coverage of national or non-national events of major importance to society."
"The examples we usually give are the Olympic Games and, in football, the World Cup and the European Championship."
"These provisions appear in a new article of the Directive - Article 3a."
"They consist of a system known as mutual recognition, which is designed to prevent evasion of national measures to guarantee access to television repeats of important events."
"The system comprises three phases:"
"Firstly, Member States can draw up a list of major events and adopt measures to ensure that large sections of the public are not prevented from following these events, either directly or as repeats, on open-access television."
"Secondly, the Commission has to be informed of these measures."
"The Commission will check that they are in keeping with Community law, and seek the opinion of a committee set up under this Directive, known as the Contact Committee, made up of Member States' representatives."
"As long as they are found to be compatible with Community law, every set of national measures has to be communicated to all the other Member States and published in the Official Journal."
"Thirdly, Member States must ensure that the television broadcasting organizations under their jurisdiction comply with the lists of events drawn up by other Member States in accordance with this procedure."
"Lastly, I want to remind you that the new Directive was published and came into force on 30 July 1997, and Member States have until 31 December 1998 to incorporate it into their respective national arrangements."
"In the Contact Committee, there has been much discussion about the application of Article 3a, and so far the Commission has not received any official notification from the Member States."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is aware that the vast majority of Member States - if not all of them - have adopted or plan to adopt measures to guarantee wide public access to television coverage of major events, and we hope to receive the relevant notifications during 1998."
"To conclude, I will give Mr McMahon an answer to his very specific question. As far as the three events you mention are concerned, the United Kingdom will need to propose them on the list it presents to the Commission, and the Commission will have to judge whether they are indeed major sporting events."
"That, therefore, is the method set out in the Directive. It is not, I repeat, a harmonization - a single list - but depends on the lists provided by the Member States, and the fact that each Member State must accept the others' lists, on the principle of mutual recognition."
"Finally, the Commission must give its approval and make sure Community law is not contravened."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his very full explanation - 6 minutes 47 seconds worth of an answer; a very full and comprehensive answer."
"What is obvious from his answer and, perhaps should be underlined, is that no Member State has sent him any information."
"Is he going to put some pressure on Member States to give him information, to give him a list?"
"How often does he envisage this committee meeting and would he invoke the infringement procedure if Member States do not give him a list?"
"Mr McMahon, a Member State does not have to present a list and may choose not to."
"That is its own decision."
"If a Member State presents a list that is, for example, over the top, because of the number of events included, or their nature (all football matches, for example) then obviously the Commission would not accept that."
"However, there is nothing to prevent a Member State from deciding it does not want to put any event on the list."
"That is perfectly acceptable."
"Therefore, I am not going to do anything."
"All I am going to do is wait for them to send me the list."
"I am sure that nearly all the Member States are going to do so."
"But it is possible that some may not. I know of at least one Member State which so far has no intention of presenting a list (which, I would point out, is not the Member State with which I am most familiar) - and that is entirely possible."
"As for the Contact Committee, we thought it was a good idea for the Commission to be able to consult, rather than act in isolation."
"Whom should we consult?"
"A contact committee was the obvious answer."
"In the end, however, it will be the Commission which adopts the decision."
"And obviously, if a Member State fails to respect the Commission's decision, the appropriate steps will be taken."
"I have a very brief question."
"I would like to know where the Ryder Cup fits into this."
"The Ryder Cup which, as you know, was held in Spain for the very first time recently, is probably the only competition where almost the entire population of Europe actually cheers for Europe."
"You might cheer for England, France, Germany or whoever, in other competitions, but the whole of Europe taking on the United States at golf actually brings the people of Europe together on that occasion for two or three days, where everyone is supporting the European team."
"Yet in the United Kingdom it was on satellite television, where the majority of people could not even watch it."
"So where does the Ryder Cup fit in to this particular scenario?"
"Mr Cunningham, I may have my own opinion about what you are asking - I think it is an important event - but at the moment I would prefer not to answer you in a personal capacity."
"At the moment, we have to wait for the various Member States to send in their lists."
"Once the lists have arrived, the Commission will consult the Contact Committee, and having received their reply and taken account of it, will adopt a decision."
"It is a question of restrictive criteria, but that does not mean that important events will not be included. And something else I think is important is that an event which is important in one country may not be so in another."
"Think of the Derby for instance."
"Obviously, that is a very important event in the United Kingdom, but it is probably of less interest in Spain or Greece."
"Well, the criterion to be used is that each Member State decides which are its important events, and the others respect that decision - hence the mutual recognition."
"Question No 58 by Birgitta Ahlqvist (H-1009/97)"
"Subject: Commission study on children and advertising"
"This is the third time I have asked Commissioner Oreja a question about the study, repeatedly promised by the Commission, on the effects of advertising on minors."
"Other independent studies have shown that children cannot be classified as consumers, on the grounds that they are unable, until the age of 12 on average, to distinguish an advertising message from objective information."
"Can the Commissioner say what stage the Commission's study has reached?"
"When will he be able to report, even informally, to the Committee on Culture, for example?"
"I think I can give Mrs Ahlqvist a brief reply."
"It is not the first time this question has been raised, and I know how concerned Mrs Ahlqvist is about this matter."
"I should like to remind her that, in response to a petition from a delegation in the Council during the revision procedure for the ""Television without frontiers' Directive, the Commission promised to carry out a study on the effect of television advertising and telesales on children, with a view to re-examining this question at the next revision of the Directive."
"I want to repeat what I said to Mrs Ahlqvist last time."
"I fully appreciate her concern, which I share."
"However, I am subject to certain limitations, and the Commission has undertaken to do this within a given timescale."
"That is, the Commission has to carry out this revision by 31 December 2000 at the latest."
"It has to produce a report on how the Directive is being implemented, which will include appropriate proposals for adjustment, if necessary."
"So, that is what we have promised to do."
"The report will also be presented to Parliament, of course."
"Unfortunately, the study cannot be started in 1998 (although that is what I would have preferred) because the budgetary authority (and Mrs Ahlqvist knows what I mean by that) has cut the appropriations proposed by the Commission for this sort of study."
"At the moment, the Commission has another priority, which I am sure is also of concern to Mrs Ahlqvist."
"It is an investigation into the anti-violence chip, which is mentioned specifically in Article 22 of the new Directive."
"We had to choose, and since our priority is the chip programme, the Commission will not be able to start the study in question until the beginning of 1999."
"Therefore, I would hope to have results during that year, or very early in 2000 at the latest. I repeat what I said last time: I want this to be done before the deadline, if possible, preferably by the date I have mentioned."
"Therefore, we should complete this study in time to include it in the application report mentioned in Article 26."
"If the situation were to change (with regard to the Notenboom procedure, for example) I can assure the honourable Member that we would take the appropriate steps to try to relaunch the study."
"As I said, I fully share the honourable Member's concern."
"I shall be very brief."
"I thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I know the Commissioner is in favour of carrying out this study."
"I have never before received an answer which is so definite about the timing as that it will be done in 1999."
"I am therefore grateful for the reply."
"However, in Sweden there is growing irritation about and criticism of children's advertising."
"People are calling for boycotts and think that something must be done."
"Now I have got this answer about the year 1999."
"Although it is negative, it is at least clearer than the two previous answers, so I thank the Commissioner for that."
"Question No 59 by Maj Theorin (H-0965/97)"
"Subject: The situation in Burma"
"The situation in Burma is very serious."
"In 1990, the NLD (National League for Democracy) won the free parliamentary elections and over 80 % of the seats contested. The result of those elections has not been respected."
"The military regime is still holding on to power, thanks to the state of emergency."
"The NLD held its first officially authorized congress on 27 September 1997, shortly after which a large number of the delegates were detained by the SLORC military dictatorship."
"What steps is the Commission prepared to take to support the opposition's struggle for democracy in Burma?"
"As regards the European Union's political position with respect to the Burma question, the first thing I want to assure you is that the common position adopted in October 1996 has been renewed."
"In that sense, the European Union is maintaining exactly the same position with regard to what has happened in that country."
"Secondly, we have continued to exclude Burma from the benefits of the system of generalized preferences, and are still doing so. As Parliament knows, that was a Commission initiative."
"Thirdly, in November the Commission presented the Council with a proposal to postpone the high-level meeting with ASEAN, because ASEAN was insisting that Burma should be there. The European Union did not accept that, and the meeting was postponed."
"I think it is an extremely positive step for us to refuse to continue to work with ASEAN until Burma's position within that group is clarified."
"With regard specifically to human rights and democracy, the Commission has set up a Europe-Burma office in Brussels, with the aim of raising public awareness about what is happening in that country. Another aim is to train future leaders, if possible, and to help the Burmese opposition."
"Overall, the funding is approximately ECU 950, 000."
"Let us hope this office can provide permanent proof that the European Union is firmly committed to Burma, and the situation there."
"I am grateful for this clear position from the Commission. We do not have a difference of opinion."
"We do not think Burma fulfils the criteria which must exist in order to be able to have economic and trade relations and to have customs privileges for this country."
"This is very important since there are European companies, probably also in my own country, which are currently considering whether to start investing in Burma, which would be very serious if it happened."
"In the US there has been a ban on new investments since May 1997 because the situation in Burma has not changed."
"The EU now has access to the legal framework and the possibility of using economic pressure."
"It is therefore important that the EU now leads the way and shows the political will."
"It is good that the Commission is entirely in agreement with me that we cannot of course allow European companies to profit from the oppression to which the Burmese State now subjects its inhabitants."
"As Mrs Theorin knows very well, the Commission has taken a very firm and clear measure regarding the Burmese Government, which I think Parliament appreciates."
"In a globalized economy, we do not have the power to determine where a private company should make an investment. In any case, in view of the situation in south-east Asia, I think it is a bit risky to talk of European investments at the moment."
"Not because of the situation in Burma, but because of the general market situation in south-east Asia at the moment."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he accepts the legitimacy of the 1990 elections in Burma in which the NLD led by Aung San Suu Kyi were the clear and legitimate winners."
"If that is the case, would he agree with me that any new elections likely to be convened by the military junta in Burma would not be accepted as legitimate and therefore would never be accepted as capable of overriding the 1990 results?"
"The answer is obvious."
"Any elections which fail to be free, democratic, transparent and open to international observation will never be recognized, either in Burma or in any other country."
"The Commission shares Parliament's concern over the human rights situation in Colombia."
"I think there is widespread recognition of the attitude taken towards this issue by the Commission and the European Union in general."
"As for the UN Human Rights Office in Bogotá, Colombia at the moment, I should say that the very existence of that office is due to the intervention of the European Union, not just because of the political support we have given, but also because of financial support. Bear in mind that because of the difficulties the United Nations is experiencing, we decided to extend Community funding for the coming year, to allow that Office and Commissioner Mazarrosa to continue working."
"As regards the paramilitary groups, especially the so-called Convivir cooperatives, I myself, at a public press conference during my latest official visit to Colombia, made clear what the European Union's position is."
"We do not consider any paramilitary activities (specifically including this type of cooperative) to form part of the normal responsibility of a state to guarantee a normal situation, in whichever country."
"We think the main thing is to promote peace and peace negotiations, between now and the general elections in May. As I had the chance to say in Colombia, we think that no matter who wins in May, the new government's main political objective must be to negotiate and seek for peace, in a country which is suffering the ill effects not just of drug trafficking, but also of the paramilitary guerilla warfare - which is also partly responsible - and of the internal political situation itself."
"It is a very complex and difficult situation, in which I think the European Union can do quite a lot to help the peace process and internal negotiations."
"Thank you for your reply."
"I agree that the situation in the country is, to say the least, difficult."
"So I cannot say that I was particularly pleased to hear that we have an office in the country."
"I have also asked a question about a specific person."
"I wonder whether I would have an answer to that question."
"I also intend to return to this question."
"It should come as no surprise to you that the European Union should be the main provider of finance, and should have been responsible for setting up a Human Rights Office in Bogotá - the first of its kind in Latin America."
"It was a decision made by the Human Rights Committee in Geneva, together with Mrs Robinson, the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who is working with us extremely well."
"I cannot remember the address now, but it is a well-known public fact that that Office has been in existence for a year."
"In autumn 1997 I had cause to criticize a Parliamentary resolution which gave onesided praise to the peace initiative of the Columbian Government without taking a position on the fact that at the same time the Government in Columbia was also bombing civilian targets."
"We have now had another reminder of the Columbian Government's duplicity through its arming and use of these paramilitary groups."
"It therefore means a lot to be able to interpret the Commission's answer as meaning that it does not share the former Parliamentary majority's illusions and its somewhat naive view of the Columbian Government, but has a more critical attitude towards that Government."
"We can be grateful for that."
"No, no, my position is still the same."
"I agree with that European Parliamentary resolution."
"In Colombia, which is a country I know well and where we are doing a lot of work in the area of human rights, those rights have been violated by the Government."
"I said as much in Bogotá."
"They have been violated by the military, but they have also been violated by the guerillas."
"In the situation in Colombia, nobody is entirely blameless."
"Everybody is responsible."
"Yes, I realize you do not like that answer, but they are all responsible for the situation."
"I agree with the Commissioner that we are all responsible for our own actions, but he seems to have made general statements of concern about human rights in Colombia without responding to any of the specific questions put to him."
"I asked you, Commissioner, what you were going to do in terms of direct discussions on the issue of the formation of armed groups to combat the paramilitaries."
"I asked if you would seek to increase funding directly to Colombian human rights organizations."
"You did not respond to either."
"Frankly, your words about support for the UN Office would be a little better received if, during one of your press conferences in Colombia, you had not said that you believed that the Convivir could be steadied and that they could continue to exist on some terms."
"Either the report I have read is wrong or you have gone directly against what the person who runs that UN Office is actually recommending, and we finance him."
"Please give us some specific answers now and not just general areas of concern."
"We are all responsible for our own actions."
"I will be very brief, Mr Howitt, because I am not sure whether I have not understood you, or whether you do not wish to understand me."
"The one thing I will not do is present a programme to combat the paramilitaries by means of NGOs."
"I do not know if I have understood you correctly."
"I am not sure if you know what a Colombian paramilitary is."
"I get the impression you do not know."
"In my opinion, to imagine that it is possible to combat paramilitaries or the paramilitary phenomenon - in Colombia, Algeria or anywhere else - by financing or not financing NGOs, reveals a naivety beyond all political discussion."
"I am sorry to have to put it so bluntly."
"Secondly, I do not believe I attacked the Human Rights Office in any way at all."
"There must have been a misunderstanding here. On the contrary; we are funding it."
"Therefore, I would ask you all to follow very closely the policy we are operating towards Colombia, and the progress we are making in a difficult situation."
"But please, do not suggest that the Commission should do things that are frankly difficult to accept."
"Since the time allocated to questions to the Commission has now expired, Questions Nos 63 to 82 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Emissions from organic compounds"
"The next item is the report (A4-0406/97) by Mr Cabrol, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Directive on limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain industrial processes (COM(96)0538 - C4-0139/97-96/0276(SYN))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cabrol report on the reduction of VOC emissions is a critical document."
"The fact is that the present draft directive will impact on many areas and will have far-reaching effects."
"The Commission report states that this initiative will apply to some 400, 000 businesses, including many SMEs, representing a total of 30 branches of industry, and will naturally affect many more consumers."
"The cost of this, as we have already heard, will amount to billions of ECU."
"The significance and scale of this issue should therefore not be underestimated."
"The proposed aim of the directive, namely a two-thirds reduction in VOC emissions, certainly justifies the cost involved."
"A reduction of this magnitude over the next few years is a truly ambitious goal."
"It is one which deserves our full support and we should not be tempted to soften its impact."
"Nevertheless, I would warn against any regulations which overshoot the target in certain areas."
"After all, what is the point of imposing stringent limits on ethyl alcohol, a relatively mild surface cleaner, when the use of alternative products, such as non-volatile solvents - which pose a much greater threat to the environment - is left out."
"We are all of the opinion that environmental protection should be promoted not primarily through compulsion but rather by incentive."
"Let me give you an example from my own country. The switch to low-solvent paints and coatings has meant that solvent consumption in Austria has fallen by about 50 % since 1990."
"I therefore advocate this kind of incentive scheme at European level so that limits can be applied in a more flexible way in these areas."
"This week we are discussing employment and job migration."
"I believe that we should seek to achieve our environmental objectives while at the same time attempting to promote our environmental policy in a moderate way, so that we can continue to sustain our existence in the years to come."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I would like to give my support to Mr Cabrol and also give him my thanks for his report on the Commission proposal."
"This directive to control the emission of VOCs from industrial installations has the support of my group, and I would like to give my personal thanks to the rapporteur for the hard work that he has undertaken and what he has achieved so far."
"It is increasingly clear that VOC emissions have an adverse impact upon human health and the environment in general, whether it is by their contribution to creating photochemical smog, ground-level ozone in our atmosphere or stimulating asthma or even cancer in our people."
"We have good reason to seek to reduce and control and even eliminate their emission from the industrial installations in which they are used."
"Their use is indeed wide-spread and the activities in which they have a role are many and various, so we have sought to set new, stronger limits on their emission in a whole range of larger industrial installations."
"As for their wider role in smaller installations, we hope the Commission will come forward as quickly as possible with a proposal to ensure that new low-solvent paints and coatings are used, and other less harmful substances are introduced."
"We clearly recognize the difficulties in some industrial sectors in reducing the use of VOCs or changing to effective alternatives and consequently we have allowed a generous time-limit for compliance, which we believe will give adequate time for the necessary change to take place."
"We think that the vote of the Environment Committee fully reflected our views and we will be giving our support to all the amendments passed by that committee, particularly those which clarify the provisions of the directive and reduce the scope for the use of national plans, so making the proposal more European-wide and more single market orientated."
"Therefore we are unable to accept the additional amendments tabled by some colleagues to the report in the part-session."
"In conclusion we hope that the Council and the Commission will accept our views, incorporate them into the proposal and make them a truly worthy part of the European Union's effort to protect the environment, and indeed a shining beacon to the whole world."
"Mr President, in this ""packed' Chamber, I note on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the European jigsaw puzzle of directives which is supposed to improve air quality in Europe is slowly but surely being completed."
"The Car Oil programme is at quite an advanced stage."
"Last month in Kyoto tough agreements were made."
"Today we are talking about the reduction in emissions from organic compounds."
"With a jigsaw puzzle, it is important on the one hand that the pieces are all there, and on the other hand, that you have the right pieces."
"With respect to these organic compounds this is not quite the case."
"What is missing in the puzzle is the piece that regulates paint thinners."
"We submitted Amendment No 8, and I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she might be able to repeat the promise which, to my knowledge, she made in the Council: to come up with a proposal for paint products this year, because these thinners are too harmful to health to be sold any longer."
"We must be careful when discussing the directive for organic compounds not to reject existing successful national programmes in advance, as suggested in Amendment No 22."
"In my country, the Netherlands, there is a voluntary agreement with industry for reducing emissions, which is showing good results."
"It would be a pity if this House were to reject these kinds of national programmes, when both the Commission and Council have given them their approval."
"My group will therefore not support Amendment No 22."
"I ask my colleagues to agree with Amendment No 3."
"Requirements for smaller installations should not be less stringent."
"VOC emissions are far too serious in these countries."
"I note that with this amendment the European airquality puzzle is nearing its completion."
"Mr President, it certainly shows the incompetence of European environmental policy that we are now setting limits for VOC emissions some 20 years after one of our Member States, namely the Federal Republic of Germany, introduced laws to control this very problem."
"I have heard a lot today about the problems facing industry."
"Many speakers have mentioned the competitive economy."
"Why are we not talking about those whose health has been ruined by chemical products? Indeed, the fact that we are not doing so is equally disgraceful."
"I know many people whose lives have been affected by solvents."
"Surely it is time for us to create standards which will ensure that fewer people will have their health damaged in the future. After all, we should not forget that costs do not just apply to industry but to our public health service as well, not to mention the many cases of personal suffering and other problems inflicted on those whose health has been impaired in this way."
"We are very concerned indeed about the substances being used in the chemical industry and I would ask you, Madam Commissioner, to look into this matter."
"Such substances are used a great deal."
"We know that they are carcinogenic and we also know that endocrines are involved - and these are quite specific issues which Parliament has also been looking into. It is precisely because of the carcinogenic and oestrogen-like effect of such substances that we must make a start on restricting their use as far as possible and on giving industry incentives to find replacements for them."
"This too is a question of competitiveness."
"We need to exert pressure for the withdrawal of products which are dangerous and which constitute a threat to health and to the environment."
"This would ultimately give us a competitive edge since we would be supplying the market with less dangerous products."
"At the moment our primary concern should be to reduce the range of substances used by the chemical industry."
"I would ask you, Madam Commissioner, to examine why the Commission is not prepared to follow the European Parliament's tougher approach and why it continues to hide behind the coat-tails of industry."
"Let me close with the plea for an immediate reduction in these toxic substances so that appropriate incentives can be offered to the industrial sector."
"We should not forget that the European Union has many citizens whose health has been impaired by chemicals, and our concern for them should be equal to - or even greater than - our concern for the interests of industry."
"Mr President, I want to start by congratulating Professor Cabrol on his report."
"In his report he has significantly deepened some of the points in the Commission proposal."
"Reducing the amount of organic compounds is necessary for two reasons."
"Firstly, because these chemicals cause ozone pollution to the earth's surface, with all the unpleasant consequences for people with bronchial problems."
"Secondly, because it has become clear by now that these chemicals are by no means harmless to the people who work with them daily."
"Painters, upholsterers, people who work with glue, people who have to clean using acetone are all seriously threatened by these chemicals."
"They will have to face psychological illnesses which are often diagnosed too late, and ruin their lives."
"These include concentration disorders, insomnia, dizziness, and in the worst case even loss of memory, personality disorders and depression."
"These syndromes, which are now known under the name of OPS, organo-psycho syndrome, were for a long time not recognized."
"A stop ought to be put to this."
"The aim of this draft directive is not to regulate the working conditions within the companies in which these organic compounds are released."
"Yet I hope that obligations to reduce them will also make a contribution to combating OPS."
"All the same, I would like to call on the Commission to pay attention to this problem as part of EU social policy."
"I am less happy with one point in the draft resolution, namely the deletion of implementation of the reduction through national programmes."
"The regulation about national plans in Article 5 of the Commission document was by no means worse than the general regulation."
"Often national plans are much more effective."
"For the rest: excellent advice, which the Council can capitalize on."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we have here a proposal which focuses on organic solvents."
"These liquid chemicals have a particularly toxic effect on people and the environment."
"We should therefore strive to limit their use as much as possible."
"For many years, solvents have been suspected of causing brain damage."
"As Mr Blokland said, this is seen to a large extent among painters who are in daily contact with these chemicals."
"That is where the term 'painter syndrome' comes from."
"This experience should be included in the directive which we are considering today, because public health is not just a leisure concept, but is indeed also a topic for the work environment."
"In other legislation the connection between the internal and external environment is recognized, and it is therefore a little mystifying that the Commission does not want to recognize the connection in this text. But hopefully the Commissioner will explain that more fully."
"I also see a clear connection with the directive on chemical agents for which Freddy Blak is the rapporteur."
"I fully support the amendment which was proposed by Mrs van Putten and adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which includes health risks from occupational exposure, and also the amendment which clarifies that Member States which are ahead of the Community with regard to the substitution of dangerous organic solvents can maintain tougher restrictions."
"It can only be an advantage to have some who lead the way and so gain experience which benefits everyone."
"Mr President, I would like to make one or two supplementary points to what has been already said by my colleague Mrs Breyer."
"My first point is that the Commission was heavily insistent on the problems of atmospheric pollution and the role of CFCs as the precursors of tropospheric ozone, but as several colleagues have already pointed out, the risks are multiple."
"The negative effects of volatile organic compounds are many."
"I lay particular stress on the risks at the place of work, but also on diffused risks, particularly the effects on the reproductive system, which have until now been very widely underestimated."
"In brief, this directive is coming at the right time."
