"Subject: Proposed EU Agency for Defence Capability Development and Acquisition"
"What discussions have already taken place within the Council for the establishment of a proposed EU Agency for Defence Capability Development and Acquisition, in order to implement the quantity and quality of the EU's military capacity?"
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council plan any further initiatives on this issue?"
"The issue of creating an intergovernmental Agency for Defence Capability Development and Acquisition was the subject of recent discussions within the framework of the European Council, which resulted in the formulation of paragraph 35 of the Presidency conclusions."
"I refer to the European Council of 20 and 21 March."
"On the basis of these conclusions, the Council addressed this issue, as it did within the framework of the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 19 May, when it reiterated this paragraph and, especially, the need to examine the possible creation within the framework of the Union of an intergovernmental defence capabilities development and acquisition agency."
"The relevant work is continuing."
"I should like to remind you that, at the initiative of the Greek Presidency and in a letter which we sent at the end of last year to the President of the Commission, we supported precisely the need for initiatives such as these, which come within the line of thinking of the question formulated by the honourable Member."
"Efforts have been made to bring forward this idea."
"Now, whether the Greek Presidency will be able to make any progress within the remaining three weeks, is difficult to answer."
"We need to bear in mind that, at the joint General Affairs Council held by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers for Defence, there was an opportunity to examine all these issues and I believe that perhaps the next opportunity will be later rather than sooner, within a period of three, four or five weeks in other words."
"Question No 10 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0330/03):"
"Subject: The Iranian regime's nuclear weapons programme"
"On August 2002 the People's Mujahedeen denounced the Iranian regime's secret nuclear weapons programme."
"Both state authorities and independent research organisations have confirmed the military purposes of this programme."
"Even Commissioner Patten in his latest declarations seems to have now admitted this fact."
"Can the Council explain what has been the role of the negotiations developed by EU and Iranian regime officials under the so-called 'constructive dialogue on energy' regarding this Iranian nuclear programme?"
"Can the Council explain what measures and changes in policy it intends to take to prevent the disastrous results of its present diplomacy regarding Iran?"
"Weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons and their non proliferation, are indeed an issue which is provoking a great deal of concern in the Union in connection with Iran."
"Mr ElBaradi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, expects to submit a report to the board of governors of the Agency in question on 16 June, containing his findings on Iran's nuclear programme."
"This report will contribute to the greater clarification of the situation as regards the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in Iran."
"The Council will take account of this report when it discusses issues relating to Iran at its next meeting."
"The question, which concerns the opinions expressed on this issue by the Commission, should rightly be submitted directly to that institution."
"Similarly, the Commission will need to explain what is happening within the framework of what is referred to as the 'constructive dialogue on energy' with Iran, given that this dialogue is being conducted on behalf of the Union by the Commission."
"The Council, especially within the framework of the broad dialogue between the Union and Iran, regularly raises the question of weapons of mass destruction and their non proliferation; the last time was on 29 April."
"The Council calls on Iran to sign, to ratify and to implement fully the relevant international agreements, especially the Additional Protocol to the ???? guarantee agreements."
"These issues were raised at the round of negotiations for a trade and cooperation agreement between the Union and Iran held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June."
"The Council clearly stated to Iran that it expected that deepening of economic and commercial relations between the Union and Iran should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran."
"Finally, I would add that the Union attaches great importance to achieving global compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in the establishment of a verifiable nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East."
"Mr President, I agree with the Council that it is the Commission who is conducting the constructive dialogue on energy."
"Nonetheless, the Commission, like the Council and the European Parliament, is part of the European Union and moreover it is for the Council to establish the broad guidelines on foreign policy."
"Consequently, if the report due to be presented soon by the International Atomic Energy Organisation contains negative conclusions, will the Council ask the Commission to break off this constructive dialogue on energy?"
"This is what I would like to know."
"It is indeed the Commission that implements decisions but it is primarily the Council that establishes the broad guidelines."
"I have already stated in my reply - and I wonder why this is being asked a second time - that the Council will take account of the report to be submitted when it discusses issues relating to Iran at its next meeting."
"Now, hypothetical questions about what this report will contain and what the Council will do if the report contains A, B or X, I cannot discuss at present."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are nearly out of time, but we will try to deal with two more questions on Iran, if the President-in-Office is willing to stay until 7.15 p.m., since we began late."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr Casaca has the floor for a supplementary question."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to ask you whether you do not find it strange that the positions you have adopted are not those held by judges, or by anyone independent; instead they are the Council's own political positions on terrorist organisations when nowhere in the press is there any mention of the matter. Where the nuclear programme in Iran is concerned, however, there is an enormous amount of detail in the scientific press and elsewhere on Iran's use of heavy water, which is only used in the construction of nuclear weapons, and the Council is doing absolutely nothing and confines itself to waiting for any future reports that the Iranian Government might submit."
"I said that there will be a report from the most authoritative international organisation."
"The Council will take account of this report and will decide what it is going to do on the basis of it."
"I would remind you that the Council has said that there will be no progress on economic and trade issues if there is no progress on the issues we are discussing; consequently, there is a de facto link between the two."
"Question No 11 by Gianfranco Dell'Alba (H-0331/03):"
"Subject: Destabilisation of the Middle East promoted by Iran"
"After Lebanon and Palestine, the Iranian regime seems to be focusing its efforts on spreading a theocratic dictatorship in Iraq, profiting from the instability prevailing in this country."
"What does the Council plan to do to prevent further destabilisation of the Middle East by the Iranian regime?"
"The Council is well aware of the fact that the restoration of viable political and economic stability in Iraq will depend to a great degree on a constructive stand by neighbouring countries."
"Consequently, the European Union is constantly urging neighbouring countries, including Iran, to demonstrate self-control and support efforts to stabilise Iraq."
"The Council has identified the peace process in the Middle East as a basic field in which the Council wishes to achieve substantial progress through more intensive dialogue with Iran."
"The Council has also made it clear to Iran that it expected that deepening of economic and commercial relations between the EU and Iran should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran."
"Both Iraq and the Middle East were discussed extensively with the Iranian side during the last EU/Iran 'broad dialogue' meeting in Athens on 29 April."
"The Union will continue to raise these issues in its contacts with Iran."
"President-in-Office of the Council, today, something which we hope will be extremely significant is taking place in Sharm El Sheik: a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, which we hope will be genuinely constructive."
"Europe is absent from these talks, and yet you are still advocating the idea of critical dialogue, which means conducting trade without giving much consideration or no genuine consideration to the matter of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"In the light of the news that Iran appears to be promoting this - as I mentioned in my statement - in the light of the protests of dozens of Members of Parliament, who are calling in a document for greater efforts, for Iran to democratise its system, failing which it will be necessary to take not necessarily military measures in its regard but measures which make it understand that critical dialogue is not the way to address issues, what is the Council's reaction to this increasingly urgent request from the Members of the European Parliament?"
"I have noted the wish for the Union to have a higher profile on this sort of issue."
"It is a minor aspect of the more general problem we constantly discuss, by which I mean how the Union can have greater weight in the foreign policy area."
"However, the Union was present at the meeting held in Crete a few days ago, at the Euro-Mediterranean conference, which was also attended by the Israelis and the Palestinians and numerous other Arab countries."
"The climate which prevailed at the discussions which we held helped bring us to the point where we can now discuss developments which may be of particular importance."
"Question No 12 by Maurizio Turco (H-0332/03):"
"Subject: The Iranian regime's anthrax programme"
"The People's Mujahedeen's denunciation of the Iranian regime's secret nuclear weapons programme in August 2002 has been proved completely correct, namely by independent research institutions, and therefore the public denunciation by the same organisation on 15 May of the Iranian regime's programme of anthrax production was naturally viewed with general acceptance by the international media."
"What does the Council intend to do about the existence of such programmes?"
"The Council would emphasise that, as a general rule, weapons of mass destruction and their non-proliferation have indeed been one of the sectors in which the European Union has had concerns in connection with Iran for years now."
"The Union is encouraging Iran to sign, ratify and fully implement the relevant international acts, especially, as I said earlier, the agreements of the International Atomic Energy Agency, because at present the Iranian nuclear programme is causing concern in the international community, to which I also referred."
"The Union is also encouraging Iran to participate fully in the work which will lead to the sixth conference to review the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, which is scheduled for 2006."
"I should like to point out that the round of negotiations held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June on an EU/Iran trade and cooperation agreement provided an opportunity at just the right time to raise the above issues with this country."
"As far as anthrax is concerned, the Council has no knowledge of any specific production programme of the Iranian regime."
"However, any indication of the possible existence of such a programme will be taken into serious account and examined with all due attention."
"This is the answer we are usually given every time anybody asks a question about relations between the European Union and any of the world's dictatorships."
"There is no antidemocratic dictatorship in the world that is not funded by the European Union on the pretext that that serves as an opening for dialogue."
"We can see what is happening in Vietnam, in Laos, in China, in Cuba."
"Your words, President-in-Office, remind me of what was said in this Chamber in December 2000 with regard to the adoption of the joint resolution on Afghanistan."
"It would seem ridiculous if we were to hear it again now."
"Our short-sighted attitude to the future, despite the fact that we can already see clearly what is likely to happen, and this approach to international relations are disturbing as well as wholly unconvincing and herald much greater destruction than what we ourselves are already facilitating today."
"Question No 13 by Marco Cappato (H-0333/03):"
"Subject: Democracy and human rights in Iran"
"Seven years after the Iranian regime tried to convince the Iranians and the international community that it was open to change and to democratisation, it is now clear - to all the observers, and to the Iranian people first and foremost - that nothing has changed for the better and no improvement in the human rights situation or the democratic rights has taken place."
"Does the Council support an internationally monitored referendum on the establishment of a democratic regime in Iran?"
"The Council continues to have serious concerns about violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran."
"The Council is making an effort to strengthen respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to promote the rule of law in this country."
"This is being done, among other things, through the broad EU/Iran dialogue on human rights set up last December."
"The Council has repeatedly made it clear that deepening of commercial relations between the EU and Iran - which are also the aim of the negotiations being held on a trade and cooperation agreement - should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran."
"This means that any reinforced cooperation and trade with Iran must go hand in hand with substantial positive developments in various sectors which are giving rise to concern in the Union, including and especially human rights."
"Mr President, the issue raised in this question is actually the more general matter of the Council's willingness to make a clear, practical proposal on a transition which it considers to be essential and indispensable in the process of democratisation."
"My question referred to a referendum on the establishment of democracy."
"If we do not want a referendum, then other instruments can be found."
"The important thing is for the Council to lay down the parameters."
"This is an explicit request."
"We cannot be content with calling for dialogue and mutual understanding and saying that the situation needs to be improved."
"There must be firm points of reference."
"You are against a referendum?"
"Then we want to know what points of reference the Council is establishing, what you consider to be the lowest common denominator, the absolute minimum."
"Since you are telling us today that our trade agreements will be subject to the evaluation of progress made in democracy and human rights, our question is: If there is not to be a referendum, then what threshold, what instrument, what parameter do you consider to be the absolute minimum?"
"Otherwise, we will just go round and round in circles, and then - you never know - the United States might intervene, amid general outcry, and propose other solutions or instruments."
"Mr President, I would find the idea of Parliament's passing such a resolution, proposing a change of regime in Iran and a referendum on the introduction of democracy, extremely interesting."
"From a political point of view, the Council will bear it in mind before it decides what to do."
"Thank you very much, Mr Yiannitsis."
"President. As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos. 14 to 21 will be answered in writing."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A5-0143/2003) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on analysis of the open coordination procedure in the field of employment and social affairs, and future prospects [2002/2223(INI)], and"
"the oral question (O-0044/2003 - B5-0096/2003) to the Commission, by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the application of the open coordination procedure."
"Madam President, we first need to question the reason why an own-initiative report was proposed, for we have noticed that this method is spreading to many areas."
"In Lisbon, it was recommended to apply this method to the information society, research and innovation, company policy, education and training, social inclusion, economic policy, migration policy, etc. However, we have noticed that Parliament's input and control are very restricted."
"There is a great lack of transparency in the decision-making process and in the reasons why some elements of the method are, or are not, being used."
"This is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to carry out a thorough analysis of the way in which things are being done, which has resulted in a report containing the suggestion that, if the Commission wished to start an open method of coordination, this should require the permission not only of the Council but also of Parliament."
"Moreover, the Commission must indicate the components of the method it wants to use."
"These components are common targets, common indicators, guidelines, common indicators, a summary report, national reports and recommendations."
"These are the conventional components that are used either wholly or in part."
"Parliament must give an opinion on the guidelines, the summary report and the recommendations, and the social partners must be consulted on matters relating to social policy and labour."
"Finally, the Commission is also asked to draw up a study on the method's effectiveness and on the linking of money from the Structural Funds with the recommendations that have been put to the Member States."
"To organise this in a structured manner and to prevent the open method of coordination from being developed in one area or another without Parliament's knowledge, input or codecision, it is necessary to enshrine the general mechanism and Parliament's codecision right in the constitution."
"The question is, however, whether we will succeed in doing so?"
"Judging from the texts drawn up to date by the Convention's Presidency, I notice that we have met with partial success."
"For example, it is stipulated that the open method of coordination is applied to economic policy and to employment policy and that - this is an improvement on the current texts - it can be applied to social policy."
"It is also stipulated that Parliament must be consulted or informed of the guidelines and recommendations."
"Needless to say, this is a step, albeit a small one, in the right direction."
"It is in any case more than what was deemed possible at one stage on the basis of the discussions in the Convention."
"However, it remains a drop in the ocean."
"Parliamentary powers and possibilities for control remain restricted."
"Those who are opposed to this method and labour under the illusion that if we do not mention it in the Convention, it will not be used, are, of course, mistaken."
"Nobody can stop this method from going ahead."
"A simple Council decision without any input from Parliament therefore leads to the method being used in one area or another."
"I will illustrate this with migration policy."
"If the ministers involved in migration decide to apply the method - also because, for example, they are unable to lay down legislation in this area - the open method of coordination will be applied to migration policy."
"Our problem is not so much the fact that it is being applied, but the fact that Parliament has no, or very little, involvement in it."
"This is why we said in the committee: fine, let us then, in the Convention, adopt an article clearly stating that it is obviously not prohibited to apply the open method of coordination but if it is, that it should be done in consultation with Parliament."
"This was, in fact, the meaning of the article."
"We have thus seen that some progress has been made in the Convention, that we have achieved what we wanted to some extent."
"However, it is imperfect and incomplete compared to what it should be."
"I would reiterate my two key comments: I fear that, on the one hand, the open method of coordination could result in no legislation being laid down and, on the other, that some of the national powers may possibly be removed if the open method of coordination is applied."
"There is, in fact, only one solution in both cases, which is: to allow Parliament the right of codecision."
"It is precisely the opposition to the open method of coordination that has led to this not being achieved satisfactorily."
"I can only say that this is regrettable."
"I think that we have drawn up a sound report and I would thank all the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for they have made a marvellous contribution to this report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, an ambitious objective was set in Lisbon in spring 2000 that Europe should develop into the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy in 10 years' time."
"There were a number of concrete aims associated with the conclusions reached at the summit relating to education, especially training in information technology."
"In addition to IT training, the Lisbon process emphasises the importance of lifelong learning."
"We on the European Parliament's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are pleased that education is now higher up on the Union agenda."
"We need jointly set objectives and indicators and joint action."
"The new jobs that are being created mainly demand special skills."
"Mastery of IT is nowadays required in most professions."
"It is also one of today's areas of civic education, which, if neglected, makes life difficult for people and exposes them to exclusion."
"Education is not only a key to inclusion on the part of our citizens, but also a basic prerequisite for our societies to succeed."
"It is good that the EU Education Ministers have been able to agree together on concrete aims for education and training and that the Bologna and Bruges processes, aimed at the recognition of qualifications, are under way."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Culture, in addition to education and lifelong learning, open coordination is also needed in other areas that come under the job description of the Committee, that is, in policy on youth, the media, culture and sport."
"Increased cooperation will boost the functionality of the Internal Market as well as our citizens' prosperity and degree of inclusion."
"That way we will create the right conditions for social unity, steady development and belief in the future."
"The introduction of open coordination in the field of education has, despite its worthwhile objectives, nevertheless meant problems."
"It has increased the power of civil servants and pushed aside both the European Parliament and national parliaments in the way it acquires information and exerts influence."
"This cannot continue."
"In the resolution it is drafting, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is calling for a clearer and greater role for the European Parliament."
"That is necessary for the process to have democratic authority."
"The committee is also stressing that the open coordination method must not be allowed to become like other legislative procedures but at the same time a closed procedure which will undermine the legislative aims laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"In its resolution the committee invites the Council and the Commission to hold talks with the European Parliament in order to establish an interinstitutional agreement on the open coordination method."
"The agreement should contain rules on the choice of policy areas to be included in the open coordination method and a process for applying them in a way that is consistent."
"The European Parliament must be able to participate in decision-making fully and on equal terms."
"In the view of the committee thinks the interinstitutional agreement should contain rules concerning the European Parliament's participation in drawing up aims and indicators."
"At the same time we must agree on access to documents, participation in meetings, monitoring progress and the dissemination of information."
"What is most important, however, is that open coordination should become a Community process."
"It should be decided on by the European Convention, now on the home straight, and at a future Intergovernmental Conference."
"Running parallel with the aims of the Committee on Culture is the report by Mrs Smet on open coordination in the field of employment and social affairs, which is being discussed today."
"It is good that two of Parliament's committees are playing an active role in the creation of a parliamentary dimension for open coordination, something we obviously need in Europe."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on the exceptional analysis in her report of the open coordination procedure and on the topicality of the debate, given that, as we know, this issue is also being discussed in the Convention."
"There are two essential categories of issues."
"Those which concern the democratic legalisation of the procedure and those which concern its efficiency."
"As far as democratic legalisation of the procedure is concerned, our experience to date is that only in the field of employment is there a legal basis in the Treaty."
"It is therefore an open procedure, which is applied with very specific rules defined in the Treaty and Parliament plays a role in this procedure."
"It could be much stronger, but it has a role and its opinion is necessary and respected."
"However, as Mrs Smet quite rightly said, no legal basis has been used for the other applications of the open coordination procedure."
"They have been based on agreements by the Council of Ministers."
"Consequently, the role of Parliament is still reduced, even though I must say that both on the issue of combating poverty - where we have an application of the procedure - and on the application of the procedure to pensions, an important effort has been made for us to cooperate with, consult and inform Parliament."
"In future, this procedure will certainly play an important role."
"We see that it is beginning to appear in numerous individual policies."
"The problems of the participation of Parliament, and hence its democratic legalisation, have not only their European but also their national dimension."
"In the evaluation we carried out, we saw that, in numerous countries, the national parliaments not only do not participate but also are hardly even told of the targets, commitments and method of implementation of the joint action plans."
"I believe, therefore, that with the discussion taking place in the Convention, it is very important for there to be an article covering the open cooperation procedure, determining the role of Parliament and, as the Commission has proposed, for there to be a special reference to the application of this procedure to social protection, where there are various problems, given that many of these competences in the social sector are national."
"Now as far as the area of efficiency is concerned, I would agree with the report that a national and European evaluation of the results plays a very important role in year-on-year improvements."
"Our first experience is the evaluation of the European strategy, of the application of the procedure in the area of employment carried out in 2002, while we shall have the evaluation of the application in the field of pensions in 2006."
"A second element relating to efficiency is if there will be financing of the application of the procedure."
"We must say here that, so far, there is experience concerning financing of the strategy for employment by the social fund and financing of specific guidelines, mainly those directed at human resources, and we believe that, for the area of enlargement in particular, for the new countries which will be called on to participate in the implementation of the procedure, but with reduced resources, the social fund can play a very important part."
"Finally, I should like to refer to the observation in the report that mainstreaming the gender dimension in all Community policies can also play a very important role in the application of the open coordination procedure, given that this is where individual targets which might concern equality of the two sexes are always identified."
"Madam President, I would just like to speak about the part for which Mrs Diamantopoulou is not responsible, namely culture, youth, education, media and sport."
"But I think you are also representing Mrs Reding here."
"Before the report was even planned by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we had already made an enquiry to this effect, but then - for whatever reason - it was delayed for months."
"So at last we are getting together to debate this issue, and together we should try to make the best of it."
"We realise that these coordination procedures exist, and as a European politician I would actually be pleased if some people - people in positions of responsibility, politicians - would coordinate their activities."
"These people, however, are precisely the people who are usually trying to deny us our authority."
"They coordinate their activities in areas where they do not want to grant us any responsibility at all: in the field of culture and education."
"They are suddenly coordinating in these areas without being accountable to us."
"This strikes us as rather suspect."
"The problem is that we are being treated like NGOs in this area."
"We are not NGOs, however, but elected representatives, and we ought to know what exactly is being negotiated in our name behind the scenes."
"Moreover, it is not only the Council that is content with this; the Commission too, unfortunately, is very pleased about it."
"You see, in this way it has managed to oust an awkward player from the field."
"The Council and the Commission have joined forces here - which could even be a good thing, but I would like to use Machiavelli's words here and say, 'Not every end justifies the means'."
"For this reason, I believe that we have to be very cautious in this case, and that we should expect to be included."
"It has now transpired that what has developed is an intergovernmental method."
"And once something like this has got under way, is it very difficult to stop it again."
"Although we now know that the Convention, which has little to say about coordination, declared its opposition to the open variety of it, we also know that all national presidents should coordinate with each other, where the need arises, even in instances not necessarily covered by the Treaty."
"We really need to be careful, however, not to let ourselves be excluded."
"From the point of view of culture and education, I can actually say that it is really hypocritical that we are not allowed to be active in precisely those areas where we would be happy to be involved."
"Then, in a roundabout fashion, in the context of this open method of coordination, we have the same things that we would be happy to do, but we are not included."
"This is simply unacceptable, and we must fight against it."
"We should recall that an intergovernmental method may not be introduced indirectly."
"We should see to it - including by means of today's debate - that this existing intergovernmental method, in other words open coordination, is converted into a Community method."
"If heads of governments or individual ministers recognise something to be right and necessary and important, then this too should be converted to the Community method, so that we, as elected representatives of our peoples, can participate."
"I ask that this be taken into account and thank all those who were involved."
"Madam President, I do not think I need to go over the ground already covered by Mrs Pack."
"I am here to illustrate an oral question tabled by Mr Rocard on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, who is unable to be here this evening to illustrate it himself."
"The oral question refers to points which have already been illustrated by both Mrs Iivari and Mrs Pack, in other words the fact that we in the Committee on Culture have often realised that many of the measures debated subsequently by the Council are developed according to a coordination method from which we are excluded."
"We have been faced with measures which have already been adopted, on which we were only able to express an opinion after the event, despite the coordination method, which it would be extremely useful actually to apply to Parliament too."
"With this question, we are asking the Commission, firstly, whether it can provide any guarantee that the measures the Council adopts in future using the coordination method will be notified to Parliament and the Parliamentary committees in good time for them to be able to examine them and express opinions, and secondly, to specify - despite the fact that, in this situation, everything seems to depend on the Convention now - whether it has any proposals to make regarding the wider application of the open coordination method with a view to avoiding Parliament being excluded."
"The Members who have spoken before me have already covered all these points fully."
"We would now like to raise them once again in this oral question as specific questions to which we await a response from the Commission."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this report, although our group is also left with quite a few questions on this topic."
"I recently attended a large pensions conference where open coordination was warmly welcomed in the area of pensions."
"There are a number of issues, for example in the areas of pensions, employment, asylum, immigration - to which some reference has already been made - which require a solution at European level, and where, in most cases, a legal basis is lacking."
"The open method of coordination was a godsend."
"Despite this, there are also people - including some in my group - who are opposed to the open method of coordination."
"They are mainly against it on account of the problem cited by Mrs Smet, namely the lack of democratic legitimacy."
"A number of speakers have echoed this."
"If we pursue the open method of coordination - of which I am in favour, as also, in fact, is my group - a number of points should be addressed."
"These have to do with democratic legitimacy."
"Both the national parliaments and the European Parliament will need to be involved."
"It is unacceptable for Parliament to be consulted only if it is considered opportune to do so."
"Parliament will need to be consulted systematically."
"Mrs Smet's report also dealt with another aspect that I should like to bring to your attention."
"The big players in this field are, in fact, people in closed, high-level committees who work out virtually every detail and who then submit their ideas to the Council."
"I think that this does not benefit public involvement."
"Citizens feel represented by their Members of Parliament."
"They want to be able to talk to Members of Parliament about things that are happening or arrangements that are being made and over which, at a given time, they lose any sense of control."
"So, no matter how sound the system could be in itself, this democratic control will need to be in place."
"Another point that has already been mentioned is the issue of indicators."
"If we want to compare the facts in a number of areas of policy, the facts will need to be comparable."
"Very clear indicators will therefore need to be put in place which can be measured exactly if a comparison is to be drawn between the Member States."
"To cut a long story short, I welcome Mrs Smet's report being discussed at this time."
"In my opinion, we should ask the Commission to come to an agreement with the Member States to the effect that, if this open method of coordination is maintained in future, at least a number of basic conditions will have to be met."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur warmly for the report."
"I believe it to be important for two reasons."
"First of all, based on the experience that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have gathered, the rapporteur has drawn up a very practical assessment of what has happened in the different open methods of coordination."
"Secondly, it is also important because she offers solutions."
"In her intervention a moment ago, she herself indicated the dangers which the method entails."
"Mrs Jensen and Mr Schmid have tabled amendments which put these dangers into extra sharp focus."
"If we were to follow their solutions, particularly those of Mr Schmid, it would mean we would be maintaining bureaucratic mills full of civil servants talking among themselves and organising cosy conferences, where something may occasionally get done, but where no real results will ever be achieved - and if they were, they would remain behind closed doors."
"The good thing about the open coordination process as we know it now is that the facts and figures will now at least be on the table."
"As you know, the process started with a decision taken by Heads of State and Government, who decided at a given time to produce honest figures on employment."
"This was an extremely important achievement at the time."
"Nobody produced honest figures with regard to employment."
"Those figures are important."
"The question is then, of course, to what extent the common targets can be further pursued."
"There are risks."
"The risks are two-pronged, as Mrs Smet mentioned earlier."
"There are thus the bureaucratic mills, on the one hand, where nothing happens and which are, from the citizens' point of view, a waste of time."
"On the other hand, there is the risk that coordination will be taken to extremes."
"This is mainly a fear in Germany, which is understandable, if you know the situation in Germany, where certain powers are delegated to the federal states."
"Culture and education fall within the remit of the federal states in Germany."
"Member States will then start pooling this power."
"Then what?"
"Numerus clausi will then be agreed upon as if Germany were one country."
"This is, of course, not federalism, but exactly the opposite."
"It is, therefore, understandable that German MEPs, in particular, have problems and are concerned that this method, via the backdoor, would lead to a horrible kind of harmonisation which involves neither this Parliament nor the citizens."
"This is very understandable."
"So it is particularly pleasing, in my view, that this report offers a solution."
"The solution is that this Parliament is to give its authorisation not for applying the method but whether a method is put in place in a certain area."
"I am certain that, if we take the area of culture as an example, something like this can only achieved if Parliament plays its part in such coordination."
"This is of key importance and this is why this authorisation is so important."
"This is why I am, at present, strongly opposed to Mrs Jensen's proposal, which would prevent us from making any progress."
"For four years now, we have been trying to conclude an interinstitutional agreement, without success, as the Council says that it is not provided for in the Treaty."
"A change is therefore to be made to the Treaty."
"Mrs Smet has submitted a request to this effect and this is why I believe that we should all give our unqualified support to the solution presented in this report."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Smet on her truly remarkable report, the principal virtue of which is its timeliness."
"The open coordination method has become the general rule on the basis of our experience of the Luxembourg process and of the possibilities opened up by Articles 126 and 128 of the Treaty; it is a timely process, because this generalisation has also allowed many issues to be raised in Parliament - in relation to insufficiencies and gaps which have repeatedly been condemned and which should be resolved - and because the Convention is about to produce a constitutional Treaty, offering Parliament a great opportunity to make its voice heard."
"It is therefore a timely project and a highly topical initiative, because the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference are going to offer us the opportunity to overcome these difficulties, which, as other Members have pointed out, relate to certain fundamental visible deficiencies, the lack of openness - despite being called an open method - and also the inefficient coordination."
"We therefore have an excellent opportunity and Mrs Smet's initiative offers us an excellent reason to continue working."
"Secondly, Mrs Smet has done great work, a great report, into which she has incorporated the best ideas emerging from the debates we have held in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We socialist Members of course feel very comfortable with this report; although you and I, Mrs Smet, are very far apart physically and ideologically, we are in fact very close on this issue since you are truly dealing with and resolving our group's main concerns."
"You establish a balance between all the institutions, you spell out the role of the Commission and give Parliament a central role, thereby overcoming the significant democratic deficit we have observed."
"You open up channels for transparency, in order to incorporate all the players - national and regional parliaments, NGOs, social actors - which we value highly."
"You call for an institutionalisation of the Treaty - which we believe to be essential - you define the scope in order to prevent this method from replacing or encroaching on areas in which there are Community instruments of a legislative nature - I believe you do this very well - and, finally, you guarantee that assessment work is carried out so that the method may be effective."
"We socialist Members, Madam President, are therefore going to give this report our fullest support and we hope that it will assist in European integration and help to provide European problems with a European solution, even going somewhat further than mere intergovernmentalism."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on their successful and fruitful open coordination!"
"Open coordination - it sounds like a really modern logo."
"Coordinating political activities and political strategies requires a great deal of logic, and we are not always used to this in the work of politics."
"It is really very welcome!"
"I had a few problems at home, trying to explain this open coordination to the Austrian public."
"We do not yet have a tradition of this in the way the Scandinavian countries do, for example."
"The first question people asked me at home was 'And what role does Parliament play in it?'"
"I had to explain to them everything I have heard here this evening, and everything we hear over and over again in the committees."
"'Of course', the citizens said, 'not just out of respect for you as a Member of Parliament, and not only as a right that a Member of Parliament must assert for herself and on behalf of the population: we demand democratic legitimisation of this wonderful opportunity!'"
"Now, as to whether open coordination is indeed such a wonderful opportunity, as I have said, I have no experience to date;"
"I am not yet a fan. Neither am I sure that conversion to the Community method is really the recipe for solving matters."
"I believe that we must look more closely at the details, which means that the three institutions must sit down at the table."
"This does not mean an act of mercy towards the European Parliament, but open, fair negotiations among the three institutions."
"It is all about the details: how is Parliament to be involved?"
"How are we to have access to documents?"
"What rules should we put in place?"
"If we really do make good progress in this regard, I may yet become a fan of open coordination."
"In the field of culture, media, sport, education and youth, it would also be a possible step towards a kind of European cultural policy, but please do not misunderstand: I am in no way referring to harmonisation of national cultural policy, but rather to effective coordination of common policies in order to achieve common goals together."
"Because, as we all know, we are simply not strong enough on our own - particularly in these sensitive areas."
"This is the reason for my request, and I cannot repeat it often enough."
"I believe that Parliament came close to speaking with one voice here. This is what is expected of Europe in many areas."
"Let the Commission consider us a partner and coordinate with us - openly!"
"Madam President, the specific fundamental assumption of the oral question tabled by Mr Rocard is whether the open method of coordination should be applied to all fields of activity covered by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and not only to those fields that are directly linked to the Lisbon strategy, that is, education and lifelong learning."
"In fact, the reason for deciding on these areas is absolutely identical to that which applies to the two that I have just mentioned."
"This was also covered by the willingness expressed by the Lisbon Council to extend open coordination to other areas."
"Since this is the case, it would be desirable also to apply the policy of open coordination, to which the European Parliament is fully committed, to the areas of culture, youth, the media and sport."
"There are de facto practices that, incidentally, could legitimise this course of action."
"This is the only way in which Parliament will be able to deliver an opinion, on a solid basis and on time, thereby usefully contributing to finding better solutions, with greater democratic legitimacy, before the Council considers any relevant initiative, to ensure that national and regional policies can also implement European policy guidelines."
"Nor can we understand how Parliament can merely be a passive spectator in this and in other matters."
"If this procedure has already proved to be relevant and necessary in a Union of 15 Member States, it will be all the more relevant and necessary in a Union of 25."
"European policies that create European added value must also be discussed by the direct representatives of the European peoples."
"We therefore need an interinstitutional agreement that provides for Parliamentary intervention in order to ensure that not only rules but also policies are established coherently, based on objectives and having indicators, entailing access to documentation and participation in steering meetings and in meetings for studying the progress made, providing information on the reports and best practices, in a process that develops the open method of coordination as the Community method."
"Parliament should, therefore, be able to act in a timely and relevant manner before the Council takes its decisions."
"The Commission should formulate proposals to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in the method adopted in Lisbon."
"It is in this context that the oral question tabled by Mr Rocard, Chairman of the Committee on Culture, becomes most relevant."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome this discussion enormously."
"I also thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, because had it not been for this initiative on the part of Mrs Smet, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport would probably not be in the situation at all where our enquiry is being debated at least in this Parliament."
"Mrs Pack pointed out that the Committee on Culture has been waiting for months for our questions - just the questions - relating to applying coordination in the field of culture, education, youth, the media and sport to be dealt with here at all."
"This makes it abundantly clear that something is not right with the system."
"The debate this evening is an opportunity to lay the issues on the table, and I hope that we will also come to some conclusions."
"The method of open coordination can certainly make an important contribution to helping us meet the public's expectations, and to improve coordination in important areas of policy where we do not want harmonisation."
"In my experience, however, this process will not gain public approval if it is not a democratic process."
"And to date it has not been democratic; it has been intergovernmental."
"This is why it is up to us to do something about it."
"If we believe efficiency to be contradictory to democracy, or flexibility or transparency contradictory to the responsible involvement of Parliament, then this - in my opinion - is indeed a sad reflection on our own shortcomings."
"This is why I hope that this debate and report can help to ensure that we finish our homework within a few weeks after the conclusion of the Convention, and that this House - and especially the two committees concerned - can respond to these questions."
"Thank you, Mrs Stauner."
"At the close of this debate I have received a draft resolution on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the report (A5-0150/2003) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a framework for the promotion of employee financial participation [COM(2002) 364 - C5-0527/2002 - 2002/2243(INI)]."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the own-initiative report before us by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs relates to the Commission communication on a framework for promoting employee financial participation, in other words, employee participation in profits and productive capital."
"The communication is intended to kick-start studies and research projects on the opportunities and risks involved in a policy of a broad distribution of assets."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the setting up of a working group of independent experts to present proposals to overcome the various problems relating to employee participation."
"The focus in this context is on transnational obstacles in enterprises operating across national borders concerning different levels of taxation for participants."
"A detail: my report proposes that, in the case of share options, tax should only be payable when the shares acquired by way of option conversion are successfully sold."
"This would make sense especially if employees, and not only top-level management, are to be given stock purchase rights."
"The primary concern of the Commission communication is to strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy in accordance with the Lisbon strategy decisions."
"The Commission proposed a productivity-related wage policy as far back as the Delors White Paper on Employment."
"Restraint in terms of cash wage increases, it suggested, would lead to higher profits and thus to investment, in other words to the creation of jobs."
"The opinion of our committee is that it is not enough to say thank you to employees for their modesty and understanding; instead, on the basis of voluntary schemes, they should have a share in the profits and investments that would not have been possible without their restraint."
"We support and complement the general principles developed by the Commission: first of all, schemes must be voluntary, in other words, both employers and employees must agree to them."
"Second, all employees must be included in the participation scheme."
"This means that part-time employees - often women - must not be excluded, in other words, there must be no discrimination against women."
"Wherever possible, unreasonable risks should be avoided, especially in the case of employees of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They face a double risk in the event of insolvency, namely that they could lose both their job and the value of their shares."
"The Commission has clearly set out its proposals for profit and equity participation in larger enterprises in particular, especially in public limited companies."
"Here, we could learn from the experience of other countries, especially countries that are models of participatory schemes, such as Britain and France."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends that more consideration should be given to the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, and that participatory schemes which are also feasible for small and medium enterprises should be promoted at national level."
"The Committees on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on Economic and Monetary Affairs and on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have given important answers to the many questions relating to profit and equity participation."
"They have presented their opinions very well, and I thank them for this."
"Special thanks also goes to the Commission for its valuable suggestions."
"The consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were very constructive, for which, thanks once again to all the parliamentary groups and to all the shadow rapporteurs."
"Here, to conclude, is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on one or two burning issues: first, because employees with equity participation are more motivated, an increase in productivity is likely."
"This leads to lower unit costs, which increases the volume of sales, with the resulting possibility of creating more jobs."
"The broad spread of ownership also increases willingness to invest, because fairer distribution of wealth stabilises the structure of society."
"Second: we need an enterprise law that coordinates co-ownership and cooperation."
"The new enterprise law must ensure that employees are no longer outsiders, but members of the enterprise."
"In 'Quadragesimos Annos' this is formulated as follows: the work-contract should be developed to become a partnership-contract."
"Through ownership and participation, employees become co-workers and co-workers become sharers in ownership and management."
"The goal is to make employees economic citizens with equal rights."
"Let us embark on the path towards this goal."
"It is in this spirit that I call upon you to approve the present report."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Menrad and all the Members who helped draft this report and highlighted the need for this debate on employee financial participation at European level to be restarted."
"I shall start by saying that I think it is very important that both the Commission and Parliament agree that there are huge differences between the institutional frameworks in the Member States and thus it is not possible for us to talk about the need to harmonise legislation and practices between the states in the field we are examining today."
"It is important that we evaluate the experience of countries in which this model has been used and where it has been proven, in accordance with the studies which we have at our disposal, that it increases the productivity and competitiveness of companies, and use this experience in order to give this practice added European value."
"I agree with the opinion expressed in the report that the Commission can encourage the older as well as the new Member States which do not have this legislative framework, so that they proceed to a fiscal framework and to an employee financial participation framework, based mainly, as I said, on the results which we have from countries in which it is applied."
"Within this framework, I am delighted to say that the Commission welcomes the setting up of the group of independent experts, which has already started work and will report to us in October and which is currently examining the obstacles faced by companies that wish to apply the employee participation system but have companies in more than one country, which is basically a serious obstacle to large companies operating at European level."
"I would highlight the need, to which Mr Menrad also refers, for national practices and national legislation to follow a series of principles, the most important of which is the need to minimise the financial risks to employees."
"The report concludes with specific proposals calling on the Commission to conduct a comparative performance analysis between countries and models, to undertake studies on the forms of participation which are most suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises, where the problems are different, and to proceed to draft a paper on trade union and management aspects, attaching, of course, special importance to the issue of gender equality."
"I should like to assure you with regard to all the foregoing that the Commission will promote all these proposals to the greatest possible extent and to say that, as we speak, the Commission is already drafting a study on precisely this subject, in cooperation with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, together with a framework of comparative evaluation indicators."
"Once this study is completed, the Commission will come back and submit a new report and this report will be within the framework of the actions to which we committed in the Commission communication for 2000-2004."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of the financial participation of employees in companies is a matter of intense debate."
"Recent events relating to the collapse of various companies that had systems of employee participation in capital demonstrate the potential risks linked to this system."
"The case of Enron and others like it show how crucial it is to study the consequences of applying existing systems, to look more closely at the various alternatives for participation, whether they are associated with pension plans or linked to participation in capital, profits or share options."
"Previous experiences not only warn us of the risks but also raise many doubts about the incentive that employee participation schemes might provide for job creation and about the dangers of these being used in order to get around labour legislation and to call into question workers' rights, specifically in the field of pay, work organisation and hours, equal opportunities for men and women and maternity and paternity rights."
"We must all bear in mind the increasing volatility of the financial markets."
"Applying the private profit approach to the financial resources of national pension systems and, to some extent, the salaries and savings of employees, which is what the financial participation of employees entails, means increasing the risk of financial crises and the socio-economic consequences of these, as the rapporteur in fact states: it means putting employees at a dual risk because in the event of the company's bankruptcy they will lose both their job and the value of their shares."
"There are obviously various types of financial participation that could generate management schemes."
"The discussion is not, however, about the 'how' but more about the basic 'aim' of the proposal."
"We cannot allow it to be used to interfere in the process of setting salaries and to exert pressure for making the labour market more flexible."
"Our fellow Member Mr Menrad has sought to establish some rules, specifically on collective bargaining, arguing that pay increases should not be conducted at the same time as negotiations on financial participation or even that employee participation must be an additional element and must not replace the normal salary or other pay components such as pension schemes."
"The option of signing up to participation schemes must clearly always be voluntary and never lead to discrimination between employees or call into question other forms of participation in company life, particularly in the field of union activity."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Menrad for what is essentially a sound and conclusive report."
"Once again, you have shown yourself to be a worthy champion of employees' interests."
"Is this a theme for the European Union?"
"It certainly is!"
"The reason is that employee participation has an absolutely innovative character, both on the company and the employee side."
"That is the approach, and that is the new philosophy, which we must adopt if we want to pursue the Lisbon objectives."
"That is what I would say to the previous speaker."
"Of course it is important to distinguish between specific things as Mr Menrad himself has done."
"We are assuming that these are clear capital shareholdings which cannot supplement the existing wage and salaries systems."
"They must be dealt with separately, and that is a factor."
"We are assuming, and this has already been expounded upon, that the participation sector or participation in the industrial sector will therefore become far stronger."
"It has a psychological effect."
"It has an effect on the company."
"It is innovative, and holds promise for the future."
"That is how it has been presented."
"Yet what age are we living in?"
"That now applies to the Commission as well."
"The task is to integrate these specific models of employee participation into a specific network for the present day, in other words, to encourage employees to take an interest in obtaining shareholdings in companies."
"What is the reality in Europe?"
"We have recessional and deflationary trends, characterised by the Commission's growing pressure to make savings."
"As a result, pensions and social systems are being cut, and this does not make employees more willing to acquire shares in the corporate sector."
"That is the problem."
"In other words, if we want to make policies for the European Union, we should get down to brass tacks: we should create systems which are equipped with appropriate flanking measures so that everything can come together to form a creative whole."
"That is actually what we want."
"This cannot be the case as long there are quite different economic tendencies on the one side from our own, with our ideas, on the other."
"Employee participation must not be just a theory."
"Employee participation in the Lisbon sense means more than that!"
"Thank you, Mr Ettl."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0167/2003) by Mrs Fraisse, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on women and sport [2002/2280(INI)]."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am happy to be able to present my report to you this evening, although, as you can testify, the House is now looking a little empty."
"The issue of women and sport pertains to both my Parliamentary responsibilities."
"It relates to both the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"It is an own-initiative report, which in essence deals with a fundamental element of our democracy."
"Sport has formed part of the basis of the development of democracy since ancient times."
"I am also happy that this report has been completed under the Greek Presidency."
"I would like to give you a brief outline of the different contextual elements of this own-initiative report, as I set out to do."
"Firstly, we need to acknowledge that there is a huge disparity between the situation of men and women and between boys and girls on the issue of sport and access to sport, whether pursued at a high level or as a leisure activity."
"It is essential to recognise this disparity."
"Secondly, sport is and remains a means of self-fulfilment at all stages of life."
"The issue of equality of opportunity comes into play here."
"Thirdly, as there is the disparity I mentioned, we need to take account of an issue that poses some difficulties."
"If we want to ensure equality between young girls and young boys, between men and women and amongst teenagers and young adults, we need to take account of the disparities and differences between men and women when it comes to sporting performance."
"Some people have told me that they think this has been taken on board already. I note that both the army and the police have had to arrange for different competitive and performance-related tests for men and women."
"This is an attempt to establish equality between different body types to ensure men and women have equal opportunities."
"I have tried to explain this idea in recital M of my report in particular."
"It is difficult to achieve a situation of equality or equilibrium, however you want to put it, when we have two different starting points."
"In my opinion, these are the three contextual elements which form the basis of the report."
"I would remind you that a report on women and sport was presented to Parliament thirteen years ago."
"I had hoped to be a pioneer, but I am not."
"I must recognise that others have highlighted this problem before me, and I am delighted about this."
"There are three main contexts in which equality of opportunity and self-fulfilment are an issue, namely sport in schools, sport as a leisure activity and top-level sport."
"It is perhaps in this regard that I set out to be innovative in relation to the previous report."
"All three areas must be taken into account in the development of sport."
"School is a place for setting standards and for teaching girls and boys together."
"It is a place for opening horizons rather than slamming the door on future opportunities."
"All the professionals have told me that school plays a key role in women's access to sport."
"Sport as a leisure activity is a luxury for some people, for some women I should say."
"You need to have the time, the means and the opportunity to access sport in order to pursue it as a leisure activity."
"There are far fewer sports facilities for young girls, teenagers, young women and women than there are for young boys and men."
"There is a great disparity in that pursuing a sport as a leisure activity is a luxury for women who have to deal with the demands of both work and a family."
"I wanted to stress this point."
"As for top-level sport, we first need to understand the issues involved."
"It is sometimes difficult to get up-to-date with what is happening in women's sport at the highest level."
"The media do not always cover the issues as they could or as they should or as we would wish them to."
"Furthermore, we must not overlook the specific health problems encountered by some top sportswomen."
"There are disorders and hormone problems which can later lead to reproductive problems or premature ageing."
"All the professionals have stressed these health problems to me."
"As one sociologist put it, sport does not equate to health, contrary to the received wisdom."
"Lastly, everyone is agreed on the need to ensure that women have a greater role in decision-making."
"This is also a key element."
"Lastly, I would like to explain that I have recently undertaken a good deal of work with the different political groups."
"I would like to thank them for being so willing to contribute."
"I would also like to thank the Greek Presidency for organising a meeting on women and sport, held in Thessaloniki on 8 March, which I attended."
"Thanks are also due to the Presidency for including my proposal to create a 'Women and Sport' unit in its declaration at the end of this meeting."
"Further, I would like to thank the International Olympic Committee and the European Women and Sport network, which have been very cooperative."
"The last idea that I would like to put forward stems from what I heard from all the parties involved, professionals included."
"They asked me to stand up for mixed participation in sport."
"This is the way forward."
"This report is entitled 'Women and Sport' but its objective is mixed participation."
"We want men and women, girls and boys to be involved in what is and should remain a pleasurable activity for both genders."
"Madam President, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Fraisse because her report is interesting but also has huge difficulties, if you think that, on the one hand, it directly concerns million of citizens in the European Union and, on the other hand, it is an issue for which there are very few competences and very little experience at European level."
"As far as the report is concerned, I should like to start with the analysis relating to the Community value of sport."
"I believe that Mrs Fraisse quite rightly demonstrates the importance of sport as an important weapon against discrimination."
"That is why both in the European Commission and in the plan for 2003, which is the year against discrimination, the dimension of sport as a means of combating discrimination is very intensely promoted, and in 2004, which is the year of sport, the plan being drawn up takes account of the issue of discrimination."
"I should like to refer more specifically, because of course I must say that I absolutely agree with the spirit of the analysis to which she herself referred just now, and comment on certain calls which directly concern the institutions."
"The first is that, as you know, the Convention has already answered the question of sport and the Treaty; it is clear - and no one disputes - that sport, with its social and educational dimension, like culture and education, are seen as support activities at European Union level, something which no Member State has contested."
"Thus we know the limits within which we can move institutionally."
"There is your proposal to create a 'women and sport' unit."
"I think that, at the present stage, it is difficult to determine the specific remit of such a unit, when there is this practical difficulty of determining competences at European level."
"As far as available studies and material are concerned, there is an important bibliography from the Council of Europe which, we believe, has been used from time to time and suffices for us to base positive action on it, and I believe that, in 2004 in particular, we shall have the possibility of progressing further and promoting the dimension of women's sport."
"Of course, we cannot sit by and do nothing while we wait for a new article in the Treaty."
"There is a margin and I think that we can progress further by improving information for sports associations and increasing awareness of the possibilities within the framework of existing Community programmes, for which there is minimal to no demand from sports-related associations and programmes."
"We might refer to the ?QUAL programme or we might refer to the research programmes, for which no such proposals have yet been formulated, or even to the DAPHNE programme, if we think about the dimension of sexual harassment in sport, which is not at all negligible."
"Consequently, I would say that I agree and we shall proceed to fully support actions to encourage sports associations to use Community programmes, but I would be more cautious on issues relating to new studies or new administrative structures, at least until we have a clearer definition of activities."
"It is clear that the European Commission is obliged in any proposals it makes to respect the legislative action of the Member States, on the one hand, and to take account of the autonomy of sports associations, on the other."
"However, one sure way of increasing the interest of the Member States and the sports associations is to promote sport for women as a means against discrimination."
"I have taken note of this in your position and would stress that sport and sports policies can clearly be used as a means of combating it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we have a long way to go towards reaching a situation in which women regularly undertake a physical activity."
"Sport is of fundamental importance to our society."
"It is an all-embracing means of increasing understanding that transcends barriers of language, nationality, religion and colour."
"As the Olympic Games of 2004 draw nearer, sport is a wonderful means of promoting peace in the world."
"Participating in sport is like being a member of a big family."
"Consequently, women should never be excluded and their interests should never be sidelined."
"We must take both horizontal and vertical action to promote equality of access to sport for women."
"In other words, we must develop sport for women and girls at all levels."
"We must develop sport in schools, sport as a leisure activity and sport at a competitive level."
"We also think it is important to target all groups of women and especially those who are less able to access sport because of their lifestyle or their status."
"Sport in schools involves more than just learning sports."
"It involves developing the role young people will play in society in future."
"Given the reticence of those young girls who drop out of sport, it is also essential to ensure young girls are more enthusiastic about doing sport."
"Sport is therefore about achieving emancipation and autonomy."
"As for sport as a leisure activity, it is clear that for many women, sport is an optional extra, that can only be considered after work, children, housework and family leisure activities."
"We are only too aware of the consequences this has on women's health."
"In addition, our sports facilities do not always allow young women and women to participate in sport at a convenient time."
"Services such as childcare are not always available."
"Lastly, sport is also a profession and a means of earning a living."
"Sports authorities and top sportspeople must therefore respect the current rules on the free movement of people and the provision of services."
"Women are in a minority in top-level sport and they are role models for young people."
"In order to encourage young girls to participate in sport, these sportswomen need to be in the public eye."
"In television programmes for example, they should not be relegated to second place, only appearing after other items."
"Being involved in sport at the highest level entails many significant physical changes that have an impact on the health and future life of participants."
"It is important to undertake specific studies on the effects of top-level sport on the health of women."
"Specific physical training should also be provided for women."
"Lastly, it is important that women are represented in all sports regardless of the level or reason for pursuing a particular sport."
"It is also essential to allow women to act as referees and umpires and to ensure both genders are represented on medical and selection committees."
"Our initiative should allow women to participate in a sporting activity on a regular basis, and gives special consideration to the case of disabled women, and also to the case of older women."
"Sport is of course an excellent means of self-development and rehabilitation."
"It also promotes the social integration of people of all ages, solidarity and allows people to exceed their expectations."
"Sport must be promoted."
"It will enhance our society and ensure the well-being of all."
"I would therefore like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fraisse and the Commission for the interest they have shown in this issue."
"Madam President, it was the struggle pursued by some women and the pressure they exerted that forced the International Olympic Committee in 1928 finally to allow women to take part in the Olympic Games as athletes but still only in a few events."
"It was only in 1964, for example, that the women's 800 metres was introduced."
"It was the pressure exerted by female athletes and trainers, their irreverence and their fighting that wrung the odd concession from highly misogynistic sports organisations."
"They started off developments to which we are now paying tribute in the debate on this report, which I support, produced at the initiative of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, whom I congratulate on her excellent work and whom I thank for having included the proposals that I tabled."
"We know that there are enormous differences in the situation of women in sport in the European Union, specifically between the countries of northern and southern Europe, although the average for women (only 16%) and girls (only 37%) claiming regularly to practice a physical and sporting activity is extremely low."
"An aspect I would therefore emphasise as being particularly important is the report's call for women's sport to be recognised as an expression of the right to equality and the freedom of all women to take control of their bodies and participate in sports publicly, regardless of nationality, age, disability, sexual orientation or religion. This means that the Member States and the European Union must adopt the measures necessary to guarantee women and men equal access to sporting activities at all levels and at all stages of life, regardless of social background, particularly in the case of the mentally or physically disabled, who should be encouraged to take part in sport and physical activity, as the report states."
"I also welcome the fact that the Commissioner has also referred to this European Year of the Disabled. I hope that it extends beyond this year."
"Hence also the importance of using the various legal and financial instruments to promote and support women's sport."
"Greater emphasis must also be placed on physical and sports education, on creating better conditions for female athletes and on ensuring equal rights in all areas of high-level sports, including decision-making and establishing conditions for active social reintegration at the end of the sports careers of female athletes."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, including those of you with observer status, if you are awake."
"As I did not start working in Parliament until April, the same time as the observer Members, I would like to mention them."
"I feel I am still a little like an observer."
"I now have the honour to speak in plenary for the first time, and I am happy that a subject has come my way that I feel is very personal to me, having acquired the kind of energy and invigoration that comes from a lifetime of sport."
"Perhaps that is the reason why we are still all in good shape here."
"I am pleased to be able to say that the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, has incorporated, if not quite all, then very many of the amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in our committee debate."
"With these amendments our group has attempted to highlight the same matter that the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, has included to some degree in her report."
"Women's sport is associated with a problem that is also familiar in the political and economic sphere: participation in decision-making."
"Real action on equality is needed to solve it."
"We should remember that sport does not just mean competitive sport, peak performance or world records."
"Sport and exercise for most people are ways of achieving a healthy, balanced life in a society that is ever more demanding and hectic."
"This is an aspect that we wish to highlight more emphatically in the report."
"Exercise and sport promote vitality, in both individual and team events."
"There are also a number of other matters whose importance I now wish to stress, having been given the floor."
"It would be very important were opportunities to participate in sport to be were stepped up for people other than those who enjoy perfect health."
"Sport is also a very effective, mentally therapeutic and socially beneficial way of improving the quality of life of sick and disabled people and helping them to cope in everyday life."
"Those who cannot walk using their own legs can ride, borrowing the legs of the horse, as it were."
"That is sport."
"Another important point to take into consideration, I think, is that ageing women and men should also be given the very same opportunities to take exercise and practise sport as the young and agile."
"Similarly, the beneficial effect of sport and its ability to rehabilitate cannot be stressed too much at this point."
"These two very important issues have now been added to the report."
"I would have nevertheless liked to have it emphasised rather more strongly how sport is the most wonderful way of integrating migrants, women and children, into a new society."
"Despite everything, we are very pleased with the report and we are only asking for a few separate votes on some points."
"I hope special attention will be given to the fact that sport as a subject for study in school should not be judged using the same indicators as for intellectual disciplines such as foreign languages and mathematics."
"I would also hope the reference to sport as an individual's fundamental right will be omitted from the report."
"I am of the opinion that sport is the right of all people, but I believe the concept 'fundamental right' would suffer inflation in this context."
"The report should also leave out the list naming those countries that did not send mixed teams to the last Olympic Games, although it is important to appeal to all countries to send mixed teams."
"If this report gets through the parliamentary debate in tomorrow's vote, as I hope it does, I will nevertheless be a little sceptical about what the Commission and the Member States will do about this matter."
"For that reason it would also be very important if we could have a follow-up to the report, and I now appeal to the Commissioner responsible and ask if we could have a follow-up report on the recommendations contained in this report before the current parliamentary terms ends in 2004."
"I would like to thank Mrs Fraisse for this report and for her passionate defence of this issue as a whole."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report, Mrs Fraisse, for all her efforts."
"Ladies and gentlemen, times have changed a lot."
"Just imagine, in 1912, when the legendary Pierre de Coubertin was asked about the possibility of organising Olympic games for women he replied as follows: 'This is impracticable, lacking in interest, anti-aesthetic and incorrect."
"The conception of the Olympic games must be based on the following formula: the solemn periodic manifestation of male sport based on internationalism, on loyalty as a means, on arts as a background and the applause of women as a recompense'."
"One hundred years is not so long ago."
"We women did not then participate in the Olympic games, but now we make up more than 40% of participants."
"And if we bear in mind that there are continents for which participation is extremely low, I believe that we have truly made great progress."
"However, as a person who has dedicated 20 years of their life to sport, first as an amateur and then as a professional, I believe there are two fronts on which we still have an awful lot to do and a very long way to travel."
"The first is the media."
"In Spain we have sports newspapers, which only cover sports, and they are some of the most widely read newspapers in our country - even more than the national newspapers - and they hardly dedicate 4% of their content to women's sport, and what is more, the content relating to women's sport often consists of news of a sentimental nature or on the postures or clothing of our sportswomen."
"This is not just a Spanish problem."
"In France, the daily L'Équipe dedicates a maximum of 5% of its news to women's sport."
"It is therefore a problem which affects the whole of the European Union."
"The second front consists of sporting bodies."
"In the world of politics, we often complain that women's participation is too low; nevertheless, I must point out that women's participation in politics is light years ahead of their participation in sporting bodies."
"In view of such a dramatic situation, in 1996 the International Olympic Committee decided that, by the end of 2000, 10% of all posts in all decision-making structures should be reserved for women, including in the international federations and bodies belonging to the Olympic movement, with a view to raising this quota to 20% by 2005."
"These are ridiculously low quotas, but what makes the situation even more serious is that these quotas are not being achieved."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the closing of the First Conference on Women and Sport, in October 1996 in Lausanne, Juan Antonio Samaranch stated that the twenty-first century should be the new era for women's participation in the world of sport."
"Amongst all of us, men and women, we must do everything we can to make this statement by Juan Antonio Samaranch a reality."
"Madam President, I should like to start by thanking and warmly congratulating Mrs Fraisse on her initiative to mobilise and increase the awareness of the European Parliament and all the competent agencies on the very serious issue of the relationship between sport and women."
"This report is particularly important and valuable in the run up to the 2004 Olympic Games and we hope that the proposals which it contains will be taken into serious account by the Athens 2004 organising committee."
"However, I should also like to warmly congratulate the Commissioner, who has responded directly and positively to the report's proposals."
"Indeed, Commissioner, sport can be a very pro-active way of combating discrimination against women and, more importantly, of combating the under-representation of women, and I think that measures should be taken in this direction in order to increase the number of women in leading positions at all levels of sports activities, to support the personal and professional development of women in the field of sport, the organisation and administration of sport and training and the organisation of sporting events at all levels."
"Mechanisms need to be created which ensure that young women will have a say in the development of policies and programmes which concern them."
"The media need to be encouraged to positively reflect and adequately cover the breadth, depth, quality and benefits of women and girls working in sport; and, finally, support is needed to achieve the standards of equality between the sexes laid down by the International Olympic Committee in 1998 and the practical application of everything included in the Thessaloniki declaration, which closed the work of a large international conference held within the framework of the Greek Presidency."
"As we approach the 2004 Olympic Games, let us make the idea of women's participation an important message from these games."
"Let the Olympic Games become a real celebration of humanity which will promote the values to which women attach particular importance, the values of peace, democracy, equality, respect for differences, dialogue between cultures, the creative coexistence of people and the resolution of differences by peaceful means."
"Thank you, Mr Karlsson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)"
"Breast cancer"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to tell you that 15 national presidents from the European Breast Cancer Coalition, Europa Donna, are following this debate in the public gallery."
"Breast cancer affects all of us."
"In the European Union, someone is diagnosed with it every two and a half minutes."
"Every year, 216 000 women suffer from this disease and 79 000 women still die from it even though 90% of all cases can be cured if they are diagnosed and properly treated at an early stage."
"For the most part, these women die when they have their most important responsibilities in society."
"Breast cancer is still the most frequent cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 55."
"Every year, though, 25 000 women could be saved if all Member States were to offer proper preventive care, that is to say, screening in accordance with the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening."
"They would provide women with a guarantee that their radiologist carries out only breast X-ray examinations and that he reads about 5 000 mammograph screenings a year, which enables him to evaluate them with an experienced eye."
"It is completely unacceptable that, eleven years after the EU guidelines were submitted, only eight Member States offer national mammography screening programmes."
"In countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, 90% of all women aged between 50 and 69 already participate in screening programmes, but in my own country of Germany, barely 2% of women in this age group are offered screening."
"This despite the fact that, according to the World Health Organisation, it can be proved that mammography screening reduces mortality by an unbelievable 35%."
"Even the best early detection is of no use however if subsequent treatment is inadequate, or downright wrong."
"The report therefore calls on Member States to establish a network of multidisciplinary breast centres to cover the entire population of the EU, with one centre for every 330 000 inhabitants. These centres should be certified by an independent body and subject to regular review."
"The entire medical team of doctors and nurses should specialise in both benign and malignant breast disease and there should be multidisciplinary case conferences to discuss each case."
"It is particularly important that the surgeons should perform only breast operations, and that the centre should perform a minimum of 150 primary breast cancer operations per year, because expert knowledge comes only through experience."
"These breast centres are extremely important because it has been shown that women who are treated in them have a higher chance of being cured."
"Rates of survival in Sweden, for example, which has both nation-wide screening and breast centres, are 16% higher than in Austria, where neither of these exist."
"In fact, only Sweden, Denmark, Portugal and the United Kingdom have breast centres that cover the entire country."
"It is precisely because of these disparities in the mortality and survival rates that we must develop a common European strategy in the fight against breast cancer."
"We have to get the right information quicker and get better at exchanging experience. We have to introduce a system of benchmarking and be guided by best practice."
"This is the only way to save the lives of more women and, at the same time, help to reduce the cost of health care."
"And I am convinced that it is the only way to exert positive pressure on countries that lag behind."
"The same is also true of national cancer registers, which are a fundamental prerequisite for reliable data, and which exist only in half of the Member States."
"Our request to governments to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU is not unrealistic."
"It can be achieved if the political will exists and if the medical profession supports us."
"The United Kingdom has been exemplary in showing us how."
"In this regard, I would ask the Commission to join us in taking stock of the situation in 2006."
"We know that the Commission is on our side. This was made clear once more with the proposal for a Council recommendation on cancer prevention."
"It is only if the proposals made in this report are rapidly implemented that every woman in Europe - irrespective of place of residence, social status and education - will soon have the same optimum screening for, and treatment of, cancer."
"Mr President, this is not the first time Mrs Jöns has brought as serious a matter as combating breast cancer into the limelight in a very specific and efficient manner and it is important and proves yet again that the commitment and systematic work of one person can set policies in motion."
"Thus, I should like personally to congratulate Mrs Jöns both on the quality of her report and on her continuous commitment to this very important issue."
"The fight against breast cancer is a public health priority."
"A number of figures were quoted. I think it is important to repeat them so that we understand the size of the problem."
"220,000 new cases a year, 75,000 women who die from this disease."
"However, according to estimates and studies, the lives of 25,000 women a year could have been saved if proper screening practices were applied to all women in the European Union."
"Prevention, therefore, proper screening, saves lives and that is also the report's message."
"In her report, Mrs Jöns examines both best practices in connection with cancer screening and best practices and effective experience in connection with treatment for and care of breast cancer."
"It is important to say that many of the elements and proposals formulated emanate from the various actions undertaken by the Commission between the years 1987 and 2002 within the framework of three successive 'Europe Against Cancer' programmes."
"These programmes, together with the new programme in the field of public health illustrate the Commission's commitment to combating this major illness."
"One important element of policies at European level, therefore, is the inventory we have today and the knowledge we have about what is happening in the Member States, so that we can choose the best and most efficient practices and so that the Member States themselves can identify their own weaknesses."
"The second important element of policies and choices is the proposal for a recommendation, which essentially also illustrates the Commission's commitment."
"The proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening issued on 5 May."
"The objective of this proposal is to formulate recommendations for the implementation of mass screening programmes on a proper scientific basis."
"This recommendation has already been submitted to the Council of Ministers for Health, which was held on Monday this week."
"What does it contain?"
"Essentially it contains a proposal for measures which aim to correlate screening practices with the results obtained in the various Member States."
"This means that there must now be quantitative targets from the Member States concerning the rate of reduction in the death rate from cancer."
"The Commission's proposal for a recommendation is a general framework which, of course, cannot have the binding force of legislation, given that we all know that these are issues that come under the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"However, this proposal for a recommendation makes provision for the submission of a report on the implementation of cancer screening programmes on the basis of the statistics provided by the Member States by the end of the third year after the date of their approval, and this report will constitute the basis for evaluating and analysing any further action."
"In addition to the proposal for a recommendation which, as I said, was the second basic element of the European Union's policy after the inventory of the existing situation, the third important element is the action programmes."
"The Commission has undertaken a major action which relates to the public health programme for the years 2000-2008."
"These programmes make use of the results and achievements of previous programmes, including the programme against cancer, and the relevant networks."
"And here I should like to welcome to the gallery the representatives of the networks, the chairmen of the organisations fighting breast cancer, and say that, in our experience also, it is clear that the role of these organisations, the commitment of volunteers, the commitment of civil society, plays a very important role and we see that, in numerous countries, there have been essential improvements and changes to the situation in the field of breast cancer due to the operation of these networks."
"Of course, some of them are also pan-European in range."
"In 2004, the Commission is due to submit a final report to the European Parliament and the Council on the success of this 'Europe Against Cancer' programme."
"This programme, the public health programme, includes exchanges of information and best practices between the Member States."
"Essentially, it is about reinforcing cooperation between states so that each can learn from the other."
"This is in keeping with paragraph 13 of Mrs Jöns' report and, of course, it recognises and supports the need for common strategies and actions in sectors such as research and technical equipment and technological development, which is also in keeping with paragraph 6 of the report."
"The Commission is currently evaluating the numerous proposals for plans submitted for funding in 2003."
"In conjunction with the priorities of the programme of work for 2003, the services will take account in the final choice of the priorities set out in the report and, of course, we shall take serious account of all the recommendations formulated."
"As far as the proposal for a conference on the outcome of the 'Europe Against Cancer' programme is concerned, I think that it should be discussed with the next presidencies."
"I should like to express a slight hesitation as to the possibility of its being organised within the framework of the Italian Presidency, given that there is not much time, but of course we can try and find the best possible time."
"Finally, allow me to inform you that the Commission intends to create a health information portal on the Internet."
"This portal will be a source of information on public health in the European Union; its content will cover a wealth of topics and it will be a single point of access for citizens, patients, doctors, experts, the competent authorities and the networks."
"We believe that this portal will be an important tool in everyone's hands for exchanging experiences and promoting policies."
"Mr President, I should like to close by thanking Mrs Jöns on behalf of Mr Byrne, who was prevented from coming by very important commitments, for her particular contribution to the implementation of our common objective and to congratulate her warmly."
"Mr President, every family, every household in the European Union has at some time or other come into contact with cancer, a terrible disease that you can never get rid of, even though you may recover from it."
"That the European Union is not only active in the field of cancer prevention and the detection of this terrible disease, but also creates the opportunities to cure cancer through the research programme there are EUR 400 million available for this research programme must be heartening for the European citizen."
"That is also the reason why Mrs Jöns and I, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and together with all its members, have worked together consummately to ensure that the report of our rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, now before you can really be seamlessly supported by our group."
"Together we have followed a path that we think is the best for everyone who has to face, will have to face or has had to face the problem."
"There are great differences in Europe."
"I am proud of my own country: our screening programme is perfect, but that does not mean that there is nothing now to be done there."
"There are differences in the sense that the breast cancer problem is greater for women in the Northern European countries, at least it occurs more, and that in other countries - and I am looking at the accession countries here too - it occurs less but the chance of a cure also differs very widely across the European Union."
"That means that what was started in the 1990s with the breast screening programmes now requires further completion, and that is why we stand together."
"I shall be making a further remark about this directly."
"I am asking the Commission for attention to be given to other programmes, other forms of cancer that are also very curable and to which I feel we have really devoted too little attention to date."
"One example is cervical cancer, which you can detect very early using the HPV test and for which we as the European Union should be exerting rather more pressure on the Member States to be rather more active in this regard too, because if it is detected then in most cases it can be cured."
"The same goes for prostate cancer."
"Same problem."
"Let there be rather more attention given to them too in the new programmes."
"What we have done is look to see whether the Commission's guidelines and programmes are adequate, where, in order to arrive at solutions, we can really only advise the Member States."
"A number of points have, I think, been highlighted."
"First of all I would mention screening, apart from which, however, it is also of the utmost importance that women, when the existence of breast cancer is suspected, should be taken care of very quickly."
"I have to say that in my country we make the occasional gaffe in this regard."
"Prompt detection therefore, but prompt treatment also."
"That is of the utmost importance and I ask you too, Commissioner, to devote attention to it."
"Another situation we must avoid is one in which, whenever cancer is detected, any small hospital can then take action."
"Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary tackling of the problem leads to the best chances of cure and I think that every woman in the European Union has a right to this."
"Mr President, we have waited a long time for this debate, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for all her work on this issue."
"It often takes one person to drive an issue forward and to obtain a result and if it were not for Mrs Jöns and all her hard work, we would probably not be sitting here today debating this issue."
"Breast cancer is one of the greatest health problems facing Scotland and the EU as a whole."
"It is the most common form of cancer amongst women in Scotland and the second leading cause of death in all women."
"The disease affects one in nine women and claims 13 000 lives in the UK every year."
"Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 55."
"These are quite chilling statistics, so what can we do to help prevent breast cancer in the first place?"
"And if diagnosed, how can we ensure that women get the best possible treatment?"
"Firstly, as the rapporteur recognises, screening has to be a priority."
"Although treatment in Scotland and the UK is better than in most Member States, with specialist nurses and the promotion of breast care centres, it is still the case that, unlike with smear testing, women only start being screened automatically at the age of 50."
"The Scottish breast-screening programme currently invites eligible women aged 50-64 every three years."
"This is a good start, but we know there is always more that can be done."
"I would like to see more women screened at an early age across the EU and in the applicant states, and although women who have a history of breast cancer in their family are more aware of the risks, and start screening earlier, there is more we can do to push Member States to promote earlier and better diagnosis."
"Recent studies show that, with improved screening of young and middle-aged women, mortality rates could be reduced by about one quarter."
"Secondly, on prevention: interestingly the report mentions that the increase in breast cancer has been worldwide since the end of the Second World War."
"Part of the reason is better diagnosis and also people understanding about genetics and family history, but our environment, lifestyle, habits and general quality of life may be related."
"That is why research is so important, as are other directives promoted by the EU: for example, the new chemicals directive which is about to work its way through the parliamentary process and may be another way to try and minimise the risks that we as EU citizens face in our daily lives; the same applies to our work in dioxins and the eHealth communication."
"Thirdly, we need to make sure that organisations like Europa Donna which have done so much work across Europe on the issue of breast cancer awareness are given the support they deserve."
"Women in the EU diagnosed with breast cancer need to understand the treatment options available to them."
"It is important that patients have access to useful information about breast cancer and support systems."
"Finally, the importance of information and awareness runs through this report; this is our goal and we should all be aiming for this."
"Mr President, I should also like to warmly congratulate Mrs Jöns on this report."
"My group spoke very appreciatively of it, despite the fact that a number of Members feel that some parts go too far in the direction of subsidiarity and for this reason abstained from the vote in committee."
"All the members of my group regard the report, as such, as being of high quality."
"I think that that is very important."
"I also have appreciation for the Commissioner and her vision of how things should proceed with this report."
"She has said that it is important to gather and to record knowledge."
"This view I share entirely."
"Member States will themselves certainly become better acquainted with their own weaknesses if they look across the border at others."
"That is by no means a luxury."
"If we look at the report closely, we see that there is a 60% greater chance of developing breast cancer in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe."
"We really must learn from that."
"Why is this so?"
"If we look at the growth in the number of women with breast cancer, again there are significant differences."
"In the European Union, for example, the number of women with breast cancer is showing the greatest growth in my own country."
"There must be reasons for this that we can find."
"In the report we read for example that women from urban areas are more prone to breast cancer than women from rural areas."
"A lot of research is therefore needed to see what factors really do have an impact on breast cancer."
"Is it actually true that the effect of using oestrogens is to increase the risk of breast cancer rather than to reduce it?"
"The answers to many of these questions remain unsatisfactory and I think that it is excellent that where we can all learn from research we do it collectively at a European level."
"This is after all the most useful way of spending the money."
"I also greatly appreciate the volunteers and the voluntary organisations that have done much to improve the quality of the treatment."
"Personally I am a great advocate of treatment in breast centres."
"Not only because of the greater chance of survival there, but also because of the total approach to the problem that women face."
"For women it is after all in some cases a violation of their body."
"A violation of the way in which they feel they lead their life as a woman."
"For a long time little attention was paid to this and we looked too much at the technical side of the disease."
"Mr President, I think it extremely important that we should continue with what the Commissioner has proposed."
"I also appreciate that she will be bringing forward a plan to provide information about cancer in general on the Internet."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has also made a number of important points."
"I therefore hope that we shall soon see all this in place and that the conference that has been requested will also be organised quickly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on my last visit to the gynaecologist she told me that the risk in Belgium has risen from one woman in 10 to one woman in eight."
"These are frightening statistics and I think that the drama of discovering breast cancer in a woman is still a major trauma for herself and her family, even though this cancer can often be cured if discovered early on."
"One in eight, though, is too high a risk and in Belgium we are in fourth place behind the Netherlands, Denmark and France."
"We must also take into account that there are unacceptably large differences in the chances of survival, depending on whether you live in one country or another."
"Early detection, diagnosis and treatment and aftercare help thousands of women to survive, but these chances of survival vary from 81% in France to 58% in Poland and Slovakia."
"That must make us think."
"The quality of the research must therefore be reliable and in this regard it concerns me that only eight countries are considering doing a general screening test."
"There are discussions about this."
"In Belgium they are baulking at the idea, on the one hand, because of the cost, but on the other I am sure that there is great pressure from the medical world to keep it to individual medical investigations by your own doctor."
"It would be good to examine the results of these different approaches critically in the light of what you, Commissioner, called cooperation in connection with knowledge gathering."
"There is a common European strategy, but there is a need to do more than prevention alone."
"I think that we need to do more research into the causes."
"Various fellow Members, Mrs Boogerd among them, have pointed out that there are still many unresearched areas."
"In particular I should like to bring Mrs Jöns's recommendation in paragraph 11 to your attention and ask you to discuss it with your fellow Commissioner Mr Busquin, because the consequence of the patenting of genes could be that this monopoly unnecessarily stands in the way of breast cancer research."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, on her report, which is rich in content and promises very good results, and I know what I am saying because I am head of a breast centre in Italy."
"I fully endorse all the calls to the Member States to achieve a rate of voluntary participation in breast screening programmes by women of over 70%, a level which no country has yet reached."
"I consider to be important the call to promote and disseminate in the Member States technical and care training initiatives and initiatives to provide patients suffering from breast cancer with psychological support, and to promote at Community level training and specialisation courses which - and this is my addition - are underwritten by university institutions, second level Masters degrees."
"These courses could even be financed out of the training funds."
"I can support the call to create European registers on tumours as soon as possible so that reliable, comparable data is, at last, available throughout the European Union on tumour growth in general."
"It is right to call upon the Member States to use resources from the Structural Funds to fund the creation of infrastructure in the health sector."
"I fully endorse the rapporteur's call for health insurance for, inter alia, aesthetic aids such as bra prostheses, wigs and whatever else a patient needs to restore their appearance as closely as possible to how is was before the illness."
"In many states, reimbursement is not provided for these aids."
"There are, however, a number of points which give cause for concern."
"I would like to point out first of all that a point is missing from the report produced by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities which is essential if that committee is to be able to claim the title 'Equal Opportunities'."
"The rapporteur has made no reference to cancer in men."
"I regret to say that this type of cancer affects men too: basically, one man per 100 000 people between the ages of 58 and 63 develops breast cancer."
"I would add that the prognosis for men is more unfavourable than for women precisely because men are not subject to screening and the cancer is diagnosed late."
"I wonder whether it would not be appropriate for the committee to grant men at least the same right to information as is accorded to women."
"Male cancer accounts for 1% of all breast tumours and I realise that its incidence is not economically significant enough to think about providing specific screening."
"I do, however, believe that an awareness campaign directed at the male population would be appropriate so that men can have the same chance as women of having their lives prolonged and their quality of life increased by early diagnosis."
"Young men are the most likely to develop breast cancer because of the wide use of female hormones and metabolisers, which spark off gynaecomastia which often goes untreated."
"The second point on which I would like to focus concerns item 7(g) of the report in question."
"I feel that informing patients that they can exercise the right to lodge complaints against doctors for malpractice is unnecessary, in that this right is already laid down in the European Charter of Patients' Rights, and that it is dangerous, for it could jeopardise the relationship of trust between doctors and patients on which studies and research have shown that half the success of treatment depends."
"I feel it would make more sense for these kinds of controls on the appropriateness of the quality of treatment to be carried out by dedicated institutions such as, for example, the European board for monitoring centres of excellence - specialist breast units."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in 2000, more than 216 000 women contracted breast cancer in the European Union and more than 79 000 women died because of it."
"Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women between the ages of 35 and 55."
"Cancer rates differ substantially from one country to another in the European Union: they are higher in the northern European countries and lower in the southern countries, such as Greece and Spain."
"Lithuania and Latvia also have low rates."
"In all countries, the rate is rising every year."
"Economic, environmental and even cultural factors have a large impact on these figures and breast cancer primarily affects women in higher social classes."
"The European guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer, which is the most effective means of achieving good results and a high chance of survival, are only recommendations and are not binding from a legal point of view."
"States draw up their own prevention and treatment plans, and these differ significantly from one State to another."
"In some countries, the programmes are regional, and there are still some Member States where early detection programmes do not even reach all women within the high-risk age bracket."
"This report, which is timely and very well written, aims to raise awareness throughout the European Union of this problem, which mainly affects women."
"Its publication has been a wise move on the part of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Every woman should have access to high-quality screening for, treatment of and aftercare in the event of breast cancer."
"As a result, we must do away with the disparities that currently exist among the Member States, whose survival rates vary by up to 16%."
"The most effective means, at this stage, of treating the cancer is still early diagnosis."
"The Community programme 'Europe Against Cancer' has been very effective and an excellent example, and we should therefore follow the same path in the future."
"Early detection, with programmes to ensure regular screening of women aged over 50, must be established in all of the Member States and the accession countries."
"The collaboration and increased awareness of women are of enormous importance: self-examination is an extremely useful tool, although mammography screening is the most effective technique for the early detection of the cancer."
"The fight against breast cancer must be a health policy priority and the Member States must draw up effective health policies and strategies to ensure better early detection, diagnosis and treatment."
"The report is very comprehensive, detailed and precise, and I congratulate Mrs Jöns on her willingness to accept suggestions and amendments that have improved the text."
"Mr President, before my speaking time starts, I would just like to clarify that Mrs Stihler spoke as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and would like to thank the House for the support given to Mrs Jöns's report."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities calls in the report for the fight against breast cancer to become a health policy priority for the EU."
"High-quality screening, diagnosis, treatment and aftercare for breast cancer must form an integrated whole and be provided in Member States."
"With the Commission's support, this can be done by 2008 in accordance with our proposal."
"In Europe, a woman dies of breast cancer every 20 minutes."
"In Germany, every year 46 000 women suffer from this disease and 19 000 die from it."
"Breast cancer affects women at the height of their professional and family responsibilities. In women between the ages of 35 and 55, breast cancer is still the most common cause of death."
"On behalf of my group, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns."
"Her work has a very positive influence, not only because of her own victory over breast cancer, but also because she is fighting for all women in the European Union to receive the best possible treatment."
"Our aims are high-quality national screening and the establishment of breast centres."
"The relevant guidelines have already been developed by the European Society for Mastology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Europa Donna."
"Now it is a question of transposing them quickly."
"The multidisciplinary breast centres shall bring together radiologists, oncologists, pathologists, psychologists and surgeons, who will consult with the patient on the best method of treatment for her."
"In Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands a nation-wide screening programme has led to a 30% reduction in the mortality rate."
"We have now been allocated EUR 400 million in the sixth framework programme of research."
"At the earliest possible opportunity, national cancer registers should be set up so that we may finally have informative data about the possible influence of risk factors like tobacco, diet, life-style and environment on the development of cancer."
"This is particularly important with regard to breast cancer."
"We do of course clash with other interest groups. In my native state of Bavaria, for example, we are taking a different path because X-raying is going to be left to general practitioners."
"It is only in accordance with the EU guidelines, however, that optimal treatment can be attained."
"Only when the attending physician reads at least 5 000 mammograph screenings per year does he acquire enough training and experience to recognise breast cancer when it is between five and seven millimetres."
"Those who do not support this are concerned only with the interests of their professional groups and not with our goal of saving thousands of women's lives."
"Every seventh or eighth woman will be affected. We can count through each row here and see how many of us that will be."
"Mr President, I too should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Jöns on her very important contribution towards raising the awareness of the institutions of the European Union about the burning issue of breast cancer, not only by drafting this excellent report, but also by organising the relevant exhibition at the European Parliament and by organising a public debate at which leading scientists from all over Europe participated, in the presence also of the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne."
"We realised at the public hearing, with sadness, disappointment and surprise, that very little money is available for research into diseases which afflict women particularly frequently, such as osteoporosis, the consequences of the menopause and breast cancer, the subject of today's debate."
"In other words, we found that more funds are available for diseases which mainly afflict men, and I say this for the benefit of my male colleagues, rather than for the benefit of the diseases which hit women; in other words, when it comes to combating diseases and health problems, there is also gender discrimination."
"And I should also like to ask the European Commission to look as this, because, as the data which the Commissioner and other honourable Members referred to show, one in eight women is afflicted by this serious disease, which mainly afflicts women between the ages of 35 and 55."
"We, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, are asking and calling for more research into the causes, for early diagnosis, for preventive measures and for treatment, once the disease has manifested itself."
"Of course, we recognise the efforts being made by the European Commission and I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for all the positive messages you have given us today about the promotion of measures and programmes with specific targets and, most importantly, for the fact that there will be an evaluation of the results and you will take account of the proposals formulated in Mrs Jöns' report in the recommendation which you are planning for the Member States and, finally, for the fact that you will take advantage of the opportunities afforded us by new technologies, especially the Internet."
"Thank you very much for these positive measures you have announced."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by thanking the Commissioner for her words, which demonstrate the Commission's commitment to addressing this serious public health problem together with the Member States, which have competence in the field of health."
"The number of breast cancer cases has increased at a terrifying rate in the European Union."
"By way of example, I wish to draw attention to the fact that in Portugal, breast cancer is the main cause of death amongst women over 45 years of age."
"3 500 new cases are diagnosed every year in my country, and every day five women die from this disease."
"Both a real political will and practical measures to improve this situation do exist, however."
"I therefore thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on her excellent report, which alerts us to the many worrying aspects of this specific type of cancer, both in Europe and throughout the world and urges us all to act urgently and make the fight against cancer one of the fundamental priorities of health policy in the European Union."
"The challenge we face is drastically to reduce breast cancer mortality rates in Europe, but also to eliminate disparities between Member States where the quality of health care is concerned and, consequently, women's chances of survival."
"We must therefore act at different levels:"
"firstly, prevention and screening. Awareness-raising campaigns must be promoted, to show that early diagnosis of the disease increases the probability that it can be cured."
"Member States must offer screenings at two-year intervals for women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, as recommended, in fact, in the European Guidelines for Mammography Screening;"
"secondly: diagnosis."
"thirdly: treatment and follow-up."
"To help patients to get through the treatment phase as painlessly as possible, they must be given access to psychological support, physiotherapy and social services."
"After treatment, the stage of medical and emotional aftercare is crucial."
"Lastly, I wish to end on a hopeful note and say that we will one day be able to defeat and eradicate this disease."
"Let us therefore make the best use not only of the EUR 400 million provided for cancer research by the sixth framework programme of research, but also of the new action programme in the field of public health (2003-2008), to develop innovative initiatives and projects."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the own-initiative report on breast cancer by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is a balanced, well-considered one."
"For that my special thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Karin Jöns."
"The report gives key importance to quality standards and best practice, which Community health policy can help evaluate and which can be extended throughout all the Member States."
"At present there are enormous disparities in the quality of treatment for breast cancer patients between Member States and regions."
"Regrettably, this is directly reflected in the chances of survival of women with breast cancer, which is directly affected by the disparity in access to screening, diagnosis and treatment."
"According to recent statistics from the World Health Organisation, approximately 80 000 women die from breast cancer in the Union every year."
"It is the most frequent cancer in women and the most frequent cause of death in middle-aged women in the EU."
"We could predict that the rise in the standard of living for women in the new Member States and the candidate countries and changes in lifestyle there will make the figures look even worse."
"There is an urgent need to create a network of national cancer registers to cover the entire enlarged Europe so as to obtain conclusive and comparable data as a basis for research."
"At present such a register only exists in seven Member States of the Union, in addition to my own country, and so not even half the citizens of the Union are covered."
"It is to be hoped that the Commission will target Community resources in particular at more effective research into the causes of breast cancer and forms of treatment as well as methods for assessing the effectiveness of treatment."
"In addition to the socio-economic and lifestyle factors the genotype is an important risk factor in breast cancer."
"To date, two defective genes have been identified as causing breast cancer."
"The European Patent Office is at present deliberating over an application to patent these breast cancer genes."
"Granting such a patent would be very harmful as far as research and improvements in treatment are concerned."
"The decision by the European Patent Office will be tremendously important."
"It is in the interests of all the European actors, and their duty too, to ensure that the human genetic code is not patented but is freely available for research and the development of medical treatments."
"Finally I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for the kind way in which you received the group of Finnish schoolchildren in April and took the trouble to come and meet them personally in Parliament."
"Your friendly and very warm attitude overwhelmed us all and gave these young people the inspiration and encouragement to face their problems."
"Mr President, Mrs Jöns has written an excellent report."
"The point has frequently been made in this debate that breast cancer is the most common cause of death in the European Union in women between 35 and 55."
"For this reason alone it is a subject deserving all our attention."
"It might also be worth mentioning, though, that the age group above this one is badly affected as well."
"One of the key points is that in the Member States there are currently still too many differences in the diagnosis, the quality of the treatment and the care of breast cancer and therefore in the chances of survival."
"But should it make any difference which country or which area or which hospital you are treated in?"
"The same is true of diseases affecting men and I refer here in particular to prostate cancer."
"It is therefore time for the European Union to adopt a more active approach in the combating of breast cancer in all countries, including the candidate Member States, in order to lift care to a higher level."
"The recommendations in the present report give all the relevant starting points."
"I am also very pleased with what the Commissioner has said, which demonstrates her positive commitment."
"There are already universal screening programmes in operation in a number of Member States."
"In the Netherlands there is one such programme for women between 50 and 75."
"I recently took part in it myself and I have to say that I find it very reassuring to know that early detection increases the chance of cure."
"Another positive element in the combating of breast cancer is that treatment by multidisciplinary teams leads to substantially better results and it seems to me that more attention here to the psychosocial side of the matter is by no means an excessive luxury."
"Breast cancer in women is not just a technico-medical matter."
"Thirdly, the recording of comparable European data concerning the development of breast cancer is needed."
"Such data may be an extra stimulus for more European research, especially into the causes of breast cancer."
"Let us be honest: we still know little about the causal factors."
"In short, a splendid and very specific report deserving of implementation and the sort of report that merits further discussion in this House."
"Mr President, the fact that the European Parliament is addressing today this major, sensitive issue concerning the health of millions of people, millions of women in our continent and throughout the world is due, as we all acknowledge, to the determination and sensitivity of Mrs Jöns, whom I too would like to thank from the bottom of my heart."
"Considering that breast cancer can be cured in 90% of cases if diagnosed early on and properly treated, as is shown, not least, by the figures provided by Mrs Jöns and by current research; considering that high quality breast screening within the framework of a regional or national programme can reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by as much as 35% for women between the ages of 50 and 69, and that, according to scientific studies recorded, the mortality rate can be reduced by 20% for women between 40 and 49 too, every woman should have access to screening, to treatment and to high quality aftercare, irrespective of where they live, their social position, profession or level of education."
"The main important points of Mrs Jöns' report are precisely an excellent prevention strategy, rapid treatment and appropriate post-operative care."
"Thus, the call to the Member States and the Commission - I would like to thank the Commissioner for her words this morning, which were reassuring - to make combating breast cancer a priority in health policy and to develop and implement effective strategies for increasing prevention, with the goal of reducing the average breast cancer mortality rate in the Union by 25% by 2008, is a key point of this report, as is the right for women suffering from breast cancer to be treated by a multidisciplinary team."
"It is therefore important for the Member States to develop a wide network of certified multidisciplinary breast units which meet specific quality criteria."
"One last point which I want to stress is the importance of research."
"The Sixth Framework Programme allocates funds to research: that is all well and good, but we need to insist that these funds for research increase, thanks, not least, to increased commitment from the Member States."
"Mr President, first of all, like all of the other speakers, I want to congratulate Mrs Jöns on her undertaking, on her work and on her excellent report."
"Breast cancer, Mr President, is the most common cancer in the European Union."
"The report by Mrs Jöns highlights some very important information and several approaches the Member States would do well to consider."
"Both the Public Health Programme 2000-2008 and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research are very appropriate arenas for proceeding with this task of reducing the effects of breast cancer."
"Research and gene therapy will also help us."
"We must also congratulate and thank the national and international cancer networks for their work, without which it would probably be impossible to make any headway."
"However, we must agree on certain things, such as the age at which early detection programmes should begin."
"Perhaps we are starting quite late in the day and we need to harmonise this therapy."
"It is also important to harmonise the collection of data and to align the situation on the ground and the treatments used."
"The disparities as regards the effect of breast cancer among the countries of the European Union and between these countries and the candidate countries are enormous."
"It is vital that we work together to harmonise this situation."
"Probably the most important aspects are health education, prevention, early detection, self-examination and, of course, mammography screening."
"Rapid treatment is essential; there are many women who have few resources at hand in this respect, to teach them how to examine themselves and at what stage in their lives they need to seek treatment."
"I therefore believe that it is vital for Mrs Jöns' work to follow this same path, because each and every one of us will benefit from it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0156/2003) by Mr Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (COM(2002) 377 - C5-0340/2002 - 2002/0141(COD))."
"As there are problems with the airlines today, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that I will have to be very strict with time."
"In order to facilitate the presidency's work, I would therefore ask you to discipline yourselves and to stick strictly to the speaking time you have been allocated."
"Mr President, I should like to apologise on behalf of Mr Byrne, who is unable to attend this important debate on healthy food due to previous commitments."
"The question of healthy food has given rise to a great deal of interest and that is not unwarranted if we think about the crises that have hit the food industry over recent years."
"The specific dossier we are debating today concerns official controls on food of animal origin."
"The proposal contains special rules for controls on meat, shellfish, fisheries products and milk and dairy products, but of course the debate focuses on the problem of meat inspections."
"The proposed system of official controls which are carried out at the fresh meat production stage has the following characteristics:"
"First, it is based on scientific data."
"The official veterinarian has a central role in the overall supervision and inspection system."
"It consists of official controls of the systems applied by the business itself and official inspection activities."
"In other words, it concerns both the business and the public authorities."
"It has espoused the 'from farm to fork' approach, it addresses both matters relating to health and the treatment of animals and it concerns the frequency and the intensity of official controls, which are dependent on the risks."
"I know here that certain Members of the European Parliament will express concern about possible trends towards privatising official controls."
"I should like to be absolutely categorical about this; there is no such danger."
"The basic responsibility always lies with the public authorities and the objective is for there to be better allocation of the human resources of the public authorities, depending on the risk presented by the businesses, by which we mean their record of compliance with the rules."
"Similarly, this system to which I refer, by which I mean official controls, is aligned with the authorities responsible for food legislation in general, especially as regards the question of responsibility, and provision is made for flexibility for small businesses as and where it is needed."
"Similarly, I should like at this point to refer to the discussions and concerns of Members of the European Parliament about the required flexibility which small businesses need to have in comparison with large businesses, and to say that provision really is being made here for flexibility in relation to traditional methods of food production, businesses in remote areas and the need for structural changes within the businesses."
"To leave the meat area, to which the basic comments I made earlier apply, let us say that the rules relating to shellfish have also been revised on the basis of scientific opinions."
"These new rules mainly aim to protect consumers from risks associated with the consumption of these products."
"I shall refer to the proposed amendments in my second intervention at the end of the debate, following the Members' comments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking those who did such an excellent job of helping me with this report - Members in the political groups, the Commission and the Council."
"I was pleased to hear the remarks of the Commissioner as well, because they seem to go in the same direction that we wish to take."
"The proposal for a regulation is an integral and important part of the overall endeavour to improve food safety within the EU, product quality in third countries exporting to the EU and to establish European food legislation."
"Its primary aim is to achieve better protection for consumers in relation to food products of animal origin for human consumption, and, as the Commissioner mentioned, the official veterinarian is at the heart of the system of official controls."
"I think that he has the right technical qualifications and this approach is therefore to be welcomed."
"The very detailed demands made on official veterinarians will have to lead to changes in study courses in the Member States. They are also necessary to ensure that scientific knowledge can be transposed into practice."
"We should however be careful that official veterinarians, who have been carrying out their responsibilities conscientiously for many years, do not have to take more exams as a result of this proposal for a regulation."
"The veterinarians are assisted by official auxiliaries in carrying out their inspections."
"For this to work successfully, it is important that both groups of people can work independently."
"Monitoring bodies that are in some way dependent on the business that is being monitored cannot, with the best will in the world, take an independent decision."
"This is why I am firmly rejecting the idea that the establishment's own staff can be used or deployed in inspecting the slaughter of pigs and bovine animals in place of official monitors."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, you have plainly been guided by financial constraints on this point."
"We have set out to increase food safety in the EU and with these measures you are going to achieve exactly the opposite, which is why we have to reject them."
"We should remember that only precise independent findings through official controls focus more on the new concept of national, and ultimately European, risk analysis and are a key element in risk management."
"This is also the basis upon which the effectiveness of the European Food Safety Authority depends."
"The situation is different with the mandatory application of food business operators' own controls as an element of strengthening their individual responsibility for the wholesomeness and high quality of their products."
"It should therefore be possible, where there is a reduced risk and own controls are taking place, to restrict official controls to checks on the findings of these own controls."
"This should be a free decision for the competent authority to take and not compulsory. A risk-based flexible approach in official controls, based on the wholesomeness of the business's products, should always be the most important factor."
"This is much better than an approach based on the intensity of production and also serves to strengthen the position of the competent authority."
"Things are again different when traditional production methods are used on farms with lower production and in outlying geographical areas."
"Here, the possibility of implementing the regulation is often restricted."
"Exceptions to the rules should, however, be limited to flexibility in the attendance of an official inspector and the forwarding of information."
"A reduction in hygiene levels cannot be accepted under any circumstances."
"The concept of 'from stable to table' is an important basis for a high level of food safety."
"The effectiveness of the system is dependent upon the quality of information going from the farmer to the shop, but - and I would like particularly to draw your attention to this - also back to the farmer."
"This is essentially a new approach, one that requires constant emphasis."
"The information should, however, be limited to criteria that are important for inspection of the slaughter and food safety."
"Information about medical treatment which does not have food safety implications, for example the administering of iron tablets to piglets, does not have to be provided, reducing the amount of information involved."
"I think that the greater inclusion of scientific competence in the food production process guarantees that the necessary information is submitted, which may well turn out to be different in each case."
"A contentious issue in the EU until now has always been the number of staff for inspections, particularly in slaughterhouses."
"I think that we should ask the Commission to make an objective proposal here along the lines of regions and farms."
"I know that it is very difficult, but it cannot be avoided."
"I am convinced that the new approach will, in any case, lead to an improvement in food safety in the EU."
"I am grateful for the cooperation I have enjoyed, and I thank all of you for your attention."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the general rapporteur and the lead committee for their work on this important proposal."
"It is essential for the sake of consumers and, indeed, producers and suppliers that we have a sensible regime for the protection of public health."
"In relation to fisheries and aquaculture products, there are some very particular challenges."
"It may not always be appropriate simply to transpose controls which are designed for farmed animals to fishing and aquaculture products."
"For example, some of the issues and challenges relating to fish diseases, dioxin levels and so forth are very specific and require regularly updated and verifiable scientific advice on which to base controls and toxin levels."
"Bivalve molluscs by their nature pose particular challenges and perhaps the testing regime for scallops, for example, ought not to be identical to that for mussels or other species."
"We have to look to species-specific controls in relation to bivalve molluscs."
"The current proposal in relation to toxin levels was based on studies carried out in Canada and Japan on mussels, and the effects on the scallop industry of the type of controls which have been envisaged could be very significant."
"We need to look very carefully at ensuring - for the sake of consumers but also those who depend on these industries for their livelihood - that risk-based measures are imposed which are reasonable in relation to the problems involved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by warmly congratulating the German veterinarians."
"They have proved outstandingly capable of defending their professional interests."
"Let me also thank Mr Schnellhardt."
"In a number of respects I do not agree with his approach, but he has worked openly and conducted consultation in a very pleasant manner."
"Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of all German veterinarians."
"There is some misinformation about the content of the proposals in circulation."
"The question therefore is whether the outcome of the vote today reflects Parliament's views."
"To be perfectly clear: I am not speaking now on behalf of my group."
"Mr Staes has already described it aptly: the flesh is weak."
"To put it in even stronger terms, part of the meat sector is especially weak when it comes to dealing summarily with abuses itself."
"Hormones, foreign proteins, water injections, impurities and harmful bacteria - they will all sound familiar to you."
"We have collectively made food safety one of the cornerstones of our mandate."
"We have succeeded in laying down the general principles of European food safety policy."
"We have all decided that the producer has primary responsibility for his products."
"That is a clear and good principle."
"Today we are taking a decision about the way in which we in Europe organise our system for controlling products of animal origin."
"In other words, where are we controlling, what are we controlling, and who is doing the controlling?"
"In the light of the general food legislation this question seems easy to answer."
"The producer ensures that his beef steak, his pork steak and his fillet of chicken are in order and the government takes care of final control."
"The Commission also wants to offer meat producers, and in particular the pig and calf farms, the scope under strict conditions to accept their responsibility themselves."
"Part of the meat sector is indeed keen to accept responsibility and itself bring abuses to an end."
"It is a pity that the rapporteur intends to nullify the opportunity that the Commission's proposal is presenting."
"It is of course strange that we first decide to place general responsibility with the producers and that we are now, today, going to reverse it again."
"For that reason alone I argue against Amendment No 135."
"I understand that the German veterinarians and the British meat inspectors have still to accustom themselves to the idea that the meat sector can take responsibility for itself."
"They think that staff of meat farms have no capability or are not in the position to monitor quality."
"To be honest we think that we must in any event move away from authoritarian farms unwilling to tolerate any criticism of the quality of their products from their employees."
"But separately from that, I ask everyone to think carefully."
"The meat sector is a highly regulated and well-controlled sector, but there is no sector that is talked about so often on account of scandals."
"The BBC recently showed a documentary about abuses in the Dutch poultry sector."
"More government control will unfortunately not help to purge the sector of malpractice."
"On the contrary, it will be counterproductive, because it removes responsibility from farms."
"I think that we must place the responsibility with the producer in a way that is recognisable for consumers."
"I therefore ask you to consider Amendment No 127."
"We must remove meat from anonymity, for that is the most effective way of improving safety and quality."
"If pork steak or fillet of chicken are placed on the market under a clear brand name, it is of the greatest importance for the producer to handle meat very carefully."
"Currently farms that fiddle can carry on regardless, because the consumer has absolutely no idea where his fillet of chicken comes from."
"Which means that we keep having complaints and incidents."
"Naming and shaming is an extremely effective way of improving food safety and quality."
"To be perfectly clear, the individual responsibility of farms does not of course replace public responsibility and public control."
"Finally, I should like the meat sector to take a critical look at itself."
"We must of course take a critical look at ourselves as well."
"Our way of working is not very transparent."
"The quantity of amendments is too great and too many of them are simply technical in nature. It is absurd that today we are voting on the position of the health stamp on the rabbit leg, on the testing of meat from hermaphrodite pigs and on the suitability of the udder for human consumption in the event of brucellosis infection."
"If we fail to concentrate on the political outlines, our work can only be judged by the meat sector and the veterinarians themselves."
"It is therefore very easy to spread misinformation, but, as this is of no help to the consumer, this is where policy itself comes into play."
"Mr President, we have a very good report here, thanks in large part to the rapporteur, who leaves us in no doubt that he understands this matter in practice as well as theory."
"It has just been said that we have to distinguish between businesses on the basis of size."
"I would be cautious about this though, as it is a question of transparency rather than size. We talk about creating transparency through the 'from stable to table' concept."
"Well, small businesses are transparent precisely because consumers understand them and have direct contact with them. If something is wrong, they report it."
"Mr Schnellhardt, you write that 'confidence is good, control is better'. I would agree with this, but nevertheless, confidence has to be discerning."
"We have to know in whom we can put our trust."
"The big problem is that meat is marketed anonymously and no one actually understands how."
"This anonymity is a cover for business deals that are criminal and practices that only just border on legality and of which the consumer would certainly not approve."
"We have just heard about water with protein being added to chicken in order to sell something cheap at an expensive price, and protein so subverted that it is not possible to detect the DNA or determine from which species of animal it comes. These examples show how the ethics in food consumption - if I may use this expression - are being abused as a result of this anonymity and at the cost of the consumer's health."
"And that is why it is a question of increasing not just confidence, but legitimate confidence."
"This has to do with making consumers more discerning."
"Of course, producers do have responsibility, and we have talked here about their individual responsibility, but so do consumers, who have to take responsibility for their health by informing themselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, who has drawn upon his professional background to produce a very technically sound report."
"Adequate food controls are important in order to guarantee the greatest possible protection of consumers."
"They ensure the safety, for example, of raw meat, game, molluscs, milk and dairy products."
"In future, therefore, food producers and processors will have to reveal all the different steps involved in their work."
"Details will have to be noted about the feedingstuffs used and the state of health of the animals."
"It will then be possible to trace food and its component parts back to the place of origin, in accordance with the transparent production chain."
"This is the only way for food authorities to react faster when there is a problem or to detect shortcomings in quality as soon as possible and to remove them."
"In the Commission's proposal, it is emphasised that small- and medium-sized enterprises are most affected, and, for them, the new hygiene rules represent a huge burden."
"The increase in expenditure will, however, result in a significant increase in food safety for the consumer, provided that the demands on businesses are bearable and affordable."
"Against this background, the rapporteur and I have jointly tabled some amendments, which take into consideration the flexibility that is essential for artisanal small businesses without, however, reducing the hygiene requirements."
"I think it is important that these artisanal small businesses should be recognised in the definition of the Regulation."
"We do have large slaughterhouses in Europe, but we also have a host of small butcher's shops."
"That is why there has to be some flexibility to adapt official controls to the size of the business."
"Inspecting a large slaughterhouse, in which thousands of animals are slaughtered and processed on a daily basis, is in nature and intensity different to inspecting an artisanal small business, in which fewer animals are processed."
"There also has to be flexibility with regard to the frequency of controls on smaller businesses."
"We need a rule stipulating when a business is to be inspected and by whom."
"An inspection plan from the competent authorities, which has been preceded by a risk analysis, should be sufficient."
"Health-based requirements should only be involved if they are actually relevant for people's health."
"What I expect from this Regulation is greater individual responsibility for producers and processors."
"European consumers will benefit directly from this."
"However, I am also very concerned that we, as legislators, should give consideration to the traditional small-business structure in Europe, in order to guarantee that both the production and supply of food is sustainable, adequate and safe, even in the less-populated areas of Europe."
"Mr President, this report has been somewhat controversial and the many amendments show that it remains so today."
"Food safety is a key priority for consumers and this regulation will lay down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption."
"Food scares are only too familiar to European Union consumers."
"Just a few weeks ago the BBC TV programme Panorama exposed a scandal connected with poultry."
"It found that chickens for human consumption have been injected with beef and pork protein."
"The programme revealed how processors were pumping chickens full of water in an effort to make them look bigger."
"There is still much to be done to protect consumer safety throughout the European Union and in the enlargement countries."
"If we want proper European Union rules for the organisation of controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, we need a directive which will promote consumer confidence and prevent scandals from happening."
"However, it is widely recognised that these controls are carried out differently in the different Member States."
"In some they are carried out by a veterinarian, in others by highly-skilled and qualified meat inspectors."
"There is growing concern, of which the rapporteur is very much aware, that the independence of meat inspectors in the UK could be put on the line with this report."
"As their representatives have said, at the moment their independence gives them powers which they would not have if they were employed by the firm where they are working."
"For example, one meat inspector told me that she would stop a production line if a chicken head had not been cut off properly - something which should be welcomed given the importance of this House places on animal welfare."
"Similarly, if there is a problem with the quality of meat, the inspector has the power to stop that piece of meat moving from the production line to the supermarket."
"If the inspectors lost their independence and were employed by the firms in which they worked, food safety would go out of the window to increase profit."
"This report should be welcomed; but we must recognise the difference between Member States in terms of controls and the importance in the UK of retaining the independence of the meat inspectorate."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his report - one aspect of which has a particular significance for my constituency in Wales - and, as other Members have covered most aspects of the report, I would like to focus on that particular issue."
"The report covers animal products other than meat, including aquaculture."
"As we have had particular problems in Wales concerning the testing of cockles, this is very important for us at this time."
"The harvesting of cockles is a long-standing and much-valued industry in coastal areas of Wales, such as the Burry Inlet and the Welsh Dee."
"About 3 000 people are employed directly, mainly small businesses and self-employed people."
"However, for two years the major cockle fisheries in these areas have been closed, causing significant hardship and even bankruptcy."
"The cause of the closure was the discovery of unidentified toxins during testing, even though not a single case of illness has been reported."
"Directive 2002/225/EC allows for either of two different test methods to be used to detect toxins, and the method used in the UK has been seriously questioned in recent months."
"As an earlier speaker mentioned, public and producer confidence is essential."
"The main issue here, and the one relevant to this report, is that to date there is no standard toxicity test for bivalve safety within the EU."
"This has meant that during the period when the cockle beds have been closed in Wales, cockles from other EU countries, which have not been subject to the same tests, could be, and have been, imported into Wales and sold."
"The purpose of this report is to improve controls under the food hygiene package, and our first priority is the health of the public."
"To do that we need very clear and detailed rules, but there must be a level playing field across Europe, and in this case that means a harmonised and more effective method of testing."
"This report will take us in that direction and it is very welcome."
"Mr President, I wish to begin with a point of order."
"I understand that there is now to be no debate on the Malliori report."
"Mrs Malliori's report has been parodied and attacked in some countries, including my own, and we are owed a small debate on it."
"I am sorry that is not possible, and I know Mrs Malliori will want to speak about this."
"I salute Mr Schnellhardt for his report and diligence."
"I agree with almost everything he says."
"On the margin, there are some areas - for example the attendance of veterinarians, fallen stock, etc. where there might be too much regulation."
"However, when it comes to the inspection of the premises where foodstuffs are being prepared, there must be independent examination."
"In my own country audits conducted by our Food Safety Authority have shown frequent evasions and omissions in terms of the way in which food is prepared, specific risk materials are dealt with and other matters are looked at."
"We are told that nowadays we can relate everything to safety within the plant, the employees and so on. Who would dare to question the right and power of the employees to report on devious practices within their own plant?"
"The fact is, as has been referred to in this debate, the preparation of some foodstuffs - as shown, for example, in the Panorama programme - has been quite disgraceful."
"I do not believe that employees in those plants would be courageous enough and willing to report these practices to authority."
"Therefore, we need independent inspectors; we do not need to remove them from the meat and veal sector."
"If we are wise in this regard, we will stick to the principle that beyond the HACCP system there always needs to be independent inspection of last resort."
"The consumer demands it, public safety requires it."
"Mr President, I should like to compliment the Commission on its proposal and I hope that Parliament will not depart from it too much."
"The Commission is demonstrating progressive insight, that is, you can increase the control of food and certainly of meat by placing greater responsibility with the people who have to carry out the control."
"On this point I should like to echo the words of our group spokesperson, Mrs Grossetête."
"On the basis of Christian Democratic principles you could say that you want to place more individual responsibility where it belongs."
"This means that farms that are well organised, that have a good branding system, can do more themselves and that at the same time there must be scope for small enterprises to continue their work."
"It also means that the present way of working in poultry meat will have to be extended to veal and pork."
"It further means that responsibility as regards the from-the-land-to-the-plate guarantee must be made good and at the same time that no deviations can be tolerated in the so-called INR system."
"I do not entirely agree with the rapporteur's position that a veterinarian should have the final decision as to whether or not an animal is safe for the food chain in cases where there is no question of airtight administrative processing."
"After all, you cannot see everything on the outside."
"I am against Amendment No 135 and in favour of Amendment No 127, and I anticipate the vote with confidence."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, is of course part of a far larger project."
"Mr Schnellhardt's education makes him an expert, which is why his reports are extremely sound and often, perhaps, even a little too technical for the layman."
"But that probably says more about him than about us!"
"I would like, therefore, to start by congratulating him on the document we have before us."
"We need food safety."
"This is something that we are all aware of, and that we support."
"This report is even more significant, though, because meat, milk and fish are basic foodstuffs."
"Professional controls are of crucial importance here."
"To adopt highly comprehensive standards is not enough if, at the same time, we either ignore controls and sanctions or take insufficient notice of them."
"Official controls are in the safe hands of veterinarians here and I hope they are duly appreciated, even by the consumer."
"Mr President, of course I completely understand that fellow Members coming in to the room might not give much attention to the subject under discussion. I am frequently in the same boat as them."
"But if you could at least see to it that the noise level improves, I might even be able to hear myself speak above this terrible din."
"I had hoped that you might at least listen to me, Mr President, as Mrs Diamantopoulou is doing."
"(The President cut off the speaker and called for quiet in the Chamber)"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"The problem of the size and transparency of businesses has been touched upon many times."
"Commissioner, I think that we simply need more flexibility for smaller businesses."
"We cannot treat large slaughterhouses like artisanal small businesses."
"I would ask you, therefore, to give appropriate consideration to creating the conditions for small- and medium-sized businesses to survive, whilst, at the same time, taking into account the vital matter of consumer protection."
"Mr President, I shall try to be very brief and to the point, by omitting any reference to amendments on which we agree and concentrating on the amendments on which there are certain reservations."
"Let us start with the question of flexibility for small businesses raised by the last speaker and by numerous other Members of the European Parliament."
"We totally agree on the need to safeguard the flexibility of small businesses, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the first and second package of health rules."
"I referred in my first intervention to special cases in which flexibility is addressed with particular sensitivity."
"Thus, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3, 11, 12 and 138, provided that certain changes are made to their wording."
"A new definition of artisanal small businesses, however, as proposed in the amendment, is not considered necessary."
"A second basic element to which numerous speakers referred concerns the role of the official veterinarian in abattoirs."
"The Commission can support the introduction of flexibility in risk analysis."
"I referred to this in my first intervention and this will apply to both large and small businesses."
"The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 134, 141 and 142."
"Amendments Nos 85 and 86 are not accepted, because we believe that they will restrict flexibility without any justification."
"As far as the use of the business's staff to carry out certain control duties is concerned, the Commission expresses its satisfaction because there is agreement with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Point 6 of Amendment No 21 on poultry meat and rabbit meat is not in keeping with the approach which has been adopted for fresh meat, as provided for in Annex I to the proposal."
"The proposal in Amendment No 87 to separate production and control responsibilities within the business is considered particularly constructive."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 127, 135, 136, 139 and 140 because they are not in keeping with the line taken by the Committee on the Environment or the line taken by the Commission and the authorities responsible for European feedingstuffs legislation."
"I would therefore ask you to re-analyse the content of these amendments and not to proceed to vote for them."
"As regards the information which must be provided when animals are slaughtered, the Commission can also agree to allow flexibility."
"However, the relevant arrangements must not undermine the system as a whole."
"Consequently, Amendments Nos 71, 72, 73, 101, 102, 103 and 107 are not accepted."
"Now to the question of marine biotoxins in shellfish. The Commission text is based on scientific proof."
"This applies to the serious risks affecting food safety."
"The introduction of excessive flexibility at this point is of no benefit to consumers; consequently, the Commission does not accept Amendment No 6, the first part of Amendment No 122 or Amendment No 123."
"Amendments Nos 4, 25 and 70 repeat the requirements already provided for in our proposal for official controls to be carried out on feedingstuffs and food which the Commission submitted last March."
"Finally, as regards the recurring question of comitology, the Commission considers that one major issue is its having the possibility to take measures to implement or adjust annexes, so that they can take account of current scientific developments."
"I would say that the Commission does, in fact, have a problem with the proposal by the Committee on the Environment proposing that this order be abolished. Consequently, we do not agree with Amendment No 38 but we do agree with Amendment No 130."
"The Commission's position on all the amendments may be obtained from the secretariat."
"Mr President, the recommendations on health are some of the most important action points in the White Paper on food safety."
"My thanks to Mr Schnellhardt and all the members of this committee who helped with this dossier, which is especially important to producers and consumers."
"Mr President, I am sorry that, because of the time, we have a change to the agenda and my report will have to be postponed until 3 in the afternoon."
"I would ask, citing Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure and on behalf of my political group, for my report, which is outside the compromise package and concerns labelling, to be voted without debate and would merely ask the Commission to make the relevant statement."
"Thank you, Mrs Malliori."
"Mr President, I have been approached by several colleagues who are concerned at the level of lobbying outside the entrance to Parliament."
"I would like to respectfully request colleagues and those who are lobbying for the signing of the register to allow Members the leeway and the freedom to sign these resolutions without having to go through 'a wall of fire' to get into the Chamber."
"I am sorry to have to raise this issue, but it is becoming a bit of a problem for us, and I notice that quite a number of colleagues are concerned about it."
"I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say this."
"Thank you, Mrs Banotti, you are completely right, as always."
"Mr President, I would like to come back to Mrs Malliori's request."
"I spoke on this subject about a week ago, to be exact on the last day of the part-session."
"The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday, but not adhered to by Thursday."
"I believe it is inaccurate for Mrs Malliori to say that her report is being postponed until this afternoon."
"Today's agenda states that the time allocated to all reports - from Mrs Jöns's through to Mrs Fourtou's - is 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., which gives us until 4.30 p.m. to discuss this report."
"If it becomes the accepted thing to request that reports are dealt with without debate in order to be finished by 12 noon on Thursday, then people should say on Monday that a debate is not required when we are adopting the agenda."
"Last time, I said that this was a dangerous precedent, and indeed it is one."
"We have had two hours for the topical and urgent debate on the reform of the Rules of Procedure taken away from us for nothing, on the grounds that this time was needed for other work, and leaving us with just one hour."
"This time should then either be used or given back for the topical and urgent debate."
"Mr Posselt spoke against the proposal by Mrs Malliori."
"Do you wish to speak on the same issue, Mrs McKenna?"
"Do you wish to speak in favour of the proposal?"
"Mr President, on this point I do not mind what we do."
"Mrs Malliori would like this to be passed through Parliament today and she has to leave this afternoon."
"She is anxious that it should get through under the Greek presidency."
"I do not want to be difficult in saying that we would vote against it, but, as Mr Posselt has said, we have to be careful about setting precedents."
"As Mrs Malliori has said, the key thing is that we would like from the Commission a clear statement on the labelling."
"The Commission has made commitments concerning labelling in other legislation."
"We would like a statement from the Commission on this now, regardless of what this Chamber decides on and whether or not we have a debate."
". Mr President, the rapporteur has today tabled a package of amendments to which both the Council and the Commission can agree."
"The Commission would like to thank Mrs Malliori and would ask the honourable Members to support her efforts."
"On the question of labelling, the Commission cannot support Amendment No 12, for the following reason: The Commission is of the opinion that if a food has a smoky taste, the consumer should be informed whether the product contains smoke flavourings or has been smoked conventionally."
"However, in order to maintain the consistency of our legislative framework, this should be addressed in the Labelling Directive and not in the current proposal."
"The Commission is currently developing a proposal for legislation including an amendment to the Labelling Directive so that the term 'smoke flavourings' would have to appear in the list of ingredients if the smoky taste of the food was due to the addition of smoke flavourings."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"As there was a speech against the proposal by Mrs Malliori and one in favour, we shall proceed directly to the vote on her proposal in the sense that her report is to be voted on without a debate."
"The proposal by Mrs Malliori is approved and her report will be put to the vote without a debate."
"Mr President, I have just two points, which are however important because they are questions of principle."
"Firstly, in future we should decide on Monday whether a matter is important enough to require debate or not."
"On Monday, we scheduled this matter for Thursday afternoon, so why are we cancelling it now?"
"If it is important, it makes no difference whether it is discussed in the morning or in the afternoon."
"Secondly - and this is a crucial point which I last brought up during another debate on a Thursday afternoon - you have, or your predecessor has, just taken a vote which is not permissible."
"According to our Rules of Procedure, only the President of Parliament can decide whether to cancel a debate."
"It is his decision alone, and there are extremely important reasons for this."
"We voted to establish the agenda on Monday and I have to clarify whether or not this decision to change it is the President's."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, this decision is his alone, but in this case he has not taken on that responsibility."
"(Applause)"
"We will not debate this any further, Mr Posselt."
"In my opinion you have misread the Rules."
"The term 'President' applies to the individual who is in the Chair at that time, so it is 'President' or 'Vice-President'."
"Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca rightly applied Rule 145."
"As to the point about being flexible or rigid, we need to keep some flexibility in our agenda"
"Mr President, I do apologise, but I would like to stress that the vote was illegal, because minorities are guaranteed the right to freedom of expression."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I have it on excellent authority that overnight an updated text has been published by the Commission on this most important and key horizontal regulation."
"It deals with changes in set-aside, WTO proofing, changes in leasing of land and a whole range of other issues."
"We have yet to see this document."
"I would like Commissioner Fischler to tell us whether it will affect the outcome of what we are about to vote on today As our Permanent Representatives and agricultural attachés have just received this document this morning, we have had no chance to consider it."
"I can explain this very quickly."
"There is no new Commission proposal."
"What has been sent out is just a record of what has been discussed so far in the Council's working group, and it does not have any bearing upon the text that we are voting on here."
"Mr President, the next vote is on Amendment No 33."
"Part 3 of the preamble to this amendment concerns an external source of protection."
"The German version of the text reads 'suitable external source of protection' and the original text reads 'qualified external source of protection'."
"The two things are not the same, and therefore I should like the German version to be corrected so that it is in line with the original, even though it may not read like good German."
"I should also like this point to be recorded in the minutes."
"Mr President, we have tried to work closely with Mr Cunha and the other rapporteurs to ensure that when we take the final vote on this we comply with Rule 63a of our Rules of Procedure."
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets state that the figures do comply with the financial perspectives up to 2006."
"However, during this vote several amendments have been adopted which have not been assessed."
"The assessments are carried out in conjunction with the Commission to ensure that the figures are within the financial perspective."
"In the light of the votes on these amendments, could the Commission inform us whether those figures remain within the financial perspective?"
"If they do, that is fine; if they do not, then the wording needs to be changed from 'do comply' to 'do not comply', for factual reasons if nothing else."
"If Commissioner Fischler does not know the answer now, I suggest, if the House agrees with Mr Cunha, that when the assessment is finalised we make sure that the correct wording goes in the final text for the Official Journal."
"That seems perfectly reasonable."
"Unless there are strong objections, it makes sense to ensure that the text corresponds with what we have decided on."
"Mr President, I think that the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets is right."
"The purpose of the amendments that we adopted is clearly that ultimately everything should remain within the budget."
"I would therefore say that there will be sufficient room for manoeuvre in this matter to amend, shall we say, the wording, should this be necessary, to ensure that this is the case."
"Mr President, it is exactly the same point."
"Four amendments have been voted which are in addition to what the committee voted."
"Our amendments say they are compatible."
"Unless we can get an assurance right now that they are, then we need to change the wording to 'not'."
"Can I ask you to follow the same procedure?"
"This will apply to all the other reports on this item and will save me from constantly getting up."
"- I am always in favour of preventing you having to jump up and down, so your point has been noted, Mr Wynn."

"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, during the debate on the Oostlander report yesterday the rapporteur asked me whether I wanted to submit Amendment No 11 - which was intended as a replacement for paragraph 52 - as an addition to paragraph 52."
"I said at the time that I was willing to do so."
"Afterwards uncertainty arose about how the text of paragraph 52 would then read once Amendment No 11, again as an addition, had been adopted."
"To avoid any misunderstanding therefore, I should like to read out the text of paragraph 52 in English as it would read following adoption of Amendment No 11 as an addition to paragraph 52."
"Mr President, I would like to make it clear that, if this is an addition, my group will agree to it."
"Mr President, I initially assented to an addition, but since the word 'conditions' has been added here to the added texts, I do not think that this is the proposal that we discussed yesterday."
"I am therefore against the submission of this oral amendment."
"There seems to be some confusion as to whether this is an oral amendment."
"Mr President, it is not an oral amendment!"
"We shall thus vote on Amendment No 11 as an addition."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, I therefore propose removing the obligatory aspect of my proposal and at the same time clarifying the content in the following format: 'calls on the Member States to introduce the gender dimension into the broadcasting of sporting competitions'."
"Mr President, I apologise for coming back to the same problem."
"I certainly do not wish to be difficult."
"However, the right to freedom of expression is highly protected."
"Even if, for example, the Conference of Presidents decides to deal with a report without debate, this decision can be overturned by 32 Members."
"Now though, a new procedure is creeping in."
"On Monday, we decide to debate a matter on Thursday afternoon and Members assume that this debate is going to take place."
"But on Thursday afternoon, a Member says that they do not wish to have the debate because they have to leave. That is what happened last time, and it happened this week too."
"The agenda stipulates that, if this happens, just one speaker should be called upon to speak for each group."
"But this procedure is not being followed either, and instead, we are referred to a rule which says that the agenda can also be changed on a proposal from the President."
"But firstly this was not a proposal from the President, secondly it must remain an exception, thirdly the President gave no reason, and fourthly I have to say that there was no important reason."
"When I asked you about it, your answer was simply that we needed 'to keep some flexibility in our agenda'."
"This is about the right of freedom of expression, a right guaranteed to minorities."
"I would very much like the Bureau to clarify under what conditions the President can propose that a point be taken off an agenda that has been jointly decided by us on Monday, and whether or not he has to give his reasons for doing so. Otherwise this minority right will be regularly set aside on Thursday afternoons if there happens to be a majority vote in favour of it."
"Then we might as well forget all the articles protecting this minority right in the Rules of Procedure, particularly Article 111."
"We are not going to agree, Mr Posselt, because I stand by my original interpretation of Rule 145."
"However, I am happy to send this to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for its interpretation."
"Rule 145 makes it very clear, however, that at any time during a debate the list of speakers may be closed."
"We had a proposal from the floor that the President then adopted in his own name and put before the House."
"The House then voted in accordance with Rule 145."
"I am not going to debate this with you, Mr Posselt, because I want to go for lunch, and I am not going to agree with you."
"As I said, I shall refer the matter to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Mr President, regarding the question that Mr Posselt has raised, I would just like to say that I think you acted correctly."
"I would, however, prefer to give my opinion on this matter later in view of the votes that still have to be taken."
"In the new Rules of Procedure, there is a provision allowing the Council and Commission speaking time to comment on the report after we have heard from the rapporteur."
"There seem to be more and more cases now where the rapporteur speaks for five minutes, and then the Council for fifteen minutes and the Commission for ten to fifteen minutes, and often not even really on the subject of the report."
"This means that Members themselves are receiving less and less time to discuss it."
"I would therefore ask that the speechwriters of the Commission and Council Presidency be told to comply as far as possible with the speaking time of five minutes, with a maximum time of ten minutes."
"Otherwise a good provision in our new Rules of Procedure is misused to give lengthy explanations, which often have nothing to do with the report."
"I would ask the President, if he agrees with me, to notify both institutions of this."
"Mr President, the three times that Mr Posselt stood up I did not respond, but on the fourth occasion I should very much like to do so, because we all know that this is not really a question of how long the debates here last."
"Mr Posselt is concerned about whether Strasbourg will remain the meeting place of the European Parliament."
"In the first place it seems important to me that the democratically taken decisions of this assembly are respected."
"It also seems important to me that those who find it so terribly important that we continue to meet in Strasbourg actually turn up."
"As you know, most of the French and German Members are the greatest advocates of this assembly in Strasbourg, but they are not present at the moment."
"This is in contrast to those who would like to meet in Brussels."
"Mr President, in my opinion, Mr van Hulten's approach is not the right one."
"This does not have to do with those who were in favour of Fridays, but who were never here then."
"It has to do with those who were not in favour of Fridays but who now treat Thursday in the same way they used to treat Friday, that is, by being absent."
"Today, some of the leading players who were not in favour of Fridays have been gone since midday."
"We need to finally get through to these people!"
". (PT) This report on the financial participation of employees makes a significant contribution to overcoming the capital versus labour split."
"Employees who participate in both the profits and the capital of companies will be more motivated and more productive and consequently the company will be more competitive and profitable."
"Furthermore, financial participation contributes to achieving two aims: completing the European social model and increasing employment."
"This is a sound report and I have therefore voted in favour of it."
"I share the principles stated for funding financial participation models, specifically: participation must be voluntary, schemes must be clear, transparent and simple, unreasonable risks for employees and a pro-cyclical impact linked to fluctuations in the economic climate should be avoided, and schemes must be compatible with worker mobility."
"I regret, however, that the European Commission has proposed few solutions for SMEs, since studies need to be carried out on the various forms of participation in SMEs and because alternatives must be considered."
". (PT) Following recent reports that have called into question the reliability of the controls organised in various Member States, updating the rules on official controls of products of animal origin is crucial, particularly in the case of fresh meat, bivalve molluscs and milk."
"I welcome the proposal for a regulation and, of the new rules, I would highlight the role given to veterinarians, the increased intensity and frequency of controls, the sound scientific basis of controls and greater flexibility for small companies."
". (PT) This proposal for a directive forms part of the process of updating Community legislation on general food hygiene rules, on health policy issues related to the marketing of products of animal origin and on official controls of products of animal origin."
"Simplifying bureaucracy and, at the same time, maintaining high standards in this field are of particular importance, since we now have incontrovertible proof that the standards of hygiene presented to the consuming public have not always been uniform or reliable."
"The measures recommended in the proposal will consequently enable us to hold all those involved at any stage of the food chain more accountable, allowing for higher levels of consumer confidence, which has been dealt severe blows by recent crises."
"We will, therefore, have to promote coherence and transparency when implementing this new legal framework, not forgetting the specific needs of small producers, who tend to be further removed from the places where information is disseminated and changes to legislation are made."
"I believe that the European Commission must consider the proposal for an amendment put forward by the rapporteur, focusing on the need to allow States to adapt to the new rules."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
". (PT) Authorisation for smoke flavourings in food is at the moment totally deregulated in the European Union - some Member States have restrictions in place and others have no legislation at all in this area."
"A definition of legislation was therefore needed, so that the authorisation procedure could be harmonised."
"I also welcome the definition of a positive list produced by the European Food Safety Authority and based on the latest scientific knowledge."
"It is therefore to be hoped that the precautionary principle - the basis for every European food policy - will also apply whenever a new application for a smoke flavouring is made."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which highlights the importance of clarifying rules in the field of human health."
"I therefore agree, in addition to the technical issues, with the rapporteur's suggestion that medical devices should be reclassified. She proposes a legal framework and that a distinction should be made between medical devices having a pharmacological effect, and others."
"Similarly, I agree with the idea that Member States should adopt the measures necessary to ensure that single-use devices are not reused."
"Lastly, I decided also to support the report when it states that it is crucial to include explicit provisions on public access to documents."
"Distributing and promoting information to the citizens, especially in this field, must be pursued as a priority, in order to ensure both citizen participation and the high level of consumer protection we wish to see."
"We are critical of the aforementioned reports on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"In our view, the reports represent an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not match the conditions and needs of modern global society."
"As an example, mention might be made of the protectionist demand for 'an overall area-based compensatory payment for rice producers and ? a fixed import duty', together with the emphasis upon the system of import duties and export subsidies as a way of stabilising the internal market in relation to the price fluctuations on the world market."
"In comparison, the Commission's proposal appears as a step in the right direction."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against these reports in their entirety."
"Mr President, the proposals for the reform of the CAP made by Mr Fischler are being driven by the World Trade Organisation, and farmers need to realise that should be their real target."
"I am disturbed that the Commissioner shows more concern for trade liberalisation than good farming practice."
"EU environmental and food safety laws can form a safety net between farming and the World Trade Organisation."
"Farmers need to wake up and stop opposing environmental legislation, such as the nitrates directive, and realise that these laws could protect them against the WTO."
"The principle of cross-compliance, which means compliance with environmental and safety laws, is an important part of Parliament's proposals."
"The Commission is right to propose making compliance with relevant food safety rules a must for receiving subsidies."
"However, it is vital that the same standards apply to imported foodstuffs, otherwise the antibiotics only just banned in the EU could make their way back onto our plates."
"Parliament's compromise shows the way forward and contains a substantial shift of money towards rural development."
"It accepts modulation while differentiating between advantaged and disadvantaged regions and, therefore, will give better compensation for poorer regions - and this is welcome."
"However, we also need to prevent the dumping of CAP-supported goods outside the European Union, which drives down world prices at great cost to the developing world and effectively prevents the most needy farmers from accessing European markets."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Cunha for their hard work."
"We in the British Conservative delegation reluctantly took the decision that we were unable to support the recommendations in the Cunha report."
"We see the need for reform, and the need for reform for our farmers."
"Therefore we cannot support horizontal or partial decoupling and as that was an integral part of Mr Cunha's report, we are unable to support that."
"However, we support the Commission in its legislative resolution and want the Council to come to an agreement as soon as it possibly can."
"We believe that the Commission's proposals are along the right lines."
"I would add that Mr Cunha is an esteemed Member of this House; he is also a personal friend."
"However, we believe, and I personally believe, that farmers need security."
"Mr Cunha's report would probably mean a second reform and we could not accept it."
"We wish to see the progressive deregulation of agriculture, together with a reduction in the size of the agricultural subsidies, and we are therefore voting against this proposal."
"The Commission's draft mid-term review was a step in the right direction towards deregulated agriculture benefiting agricultural production."
"There are serious defects in the Commission's proposal."
"We are opposed to all forms of modulation because they fail to promote rational agriculture."
"We also believe that compensation should be linked to the area utilised."
"The compromise proposal on which we have now voted would produce locking effects that would be damaging to European agriculture and a retrograde step in the reform process."
"Fifty per cent of European farmers are over 55 years old."
"The Commission's proposal might be seen more as a good pension proposal for farmers than as a plan for phasing out the policy of subsidies."
"No clear ground rules are provided, however, for the eight per cent of European farmers who are under 35 years of age and who are the future of agriculture."
". (PT) We have voted in favour of rejecting this report because it accepts, albeit in a somewhat watered-down form, the principle of decoupling aid from production, because it does not contain any real proposal for reducing and setting a limit for CAP aid and because, in certain aspects, it makes the original proposal worse."
"Furthermore, what it proposes is not a partial decoupling; it is actually a total decoupling of aid for arable crops and for male bovines."
"It reiterates the need for obligatory national co-financing for rural development measures and makes what is known as modulation optional, which calls into question not only the principle but also the Community redistribution of savings, and this would damage Portugal."
"This proposal for modulation differentiates between cuts to be made for the less-favoured regions and raises the exemption threshold by EUR 2 500, but ignores differences between producers, and mainly penalises the medium-sized rather than the largest producers."
"We regret the fact that our proposals have not been adopted, specifically those concerning modulation; doubling the additional amount of aid for farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 and exempting farmers who receive less than EUR 10 000 from cuts, which would be funded to a limit of EUR 100 000 per farmer."
"- (FR) Will Parliament be heard?"
"That is the question that we should ask ourselves today, the day before the Agriculture Summit in Luxembourg."
"Having achieved unanimity on agriculture, which should be welcomed, the most important question is whether the Council will be able to grasp the opportunity and incorporate Parliament's position into its plans for the future organisation of the common agricultural policy."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regret that codecision does not apply to agriculture."
"If it did, European farmers and consumers would have benefited so much more from the way that mentalities have rapidly changed for the better: towards moving on from costly, wasteful agriculture that destroys the countryside, towards agriculture that respects men and women, their work, the land and the environment."
"In short, ecologically responsible agriculture, which the Group of the Greens has always advocated."
"This reform of the CAP over 10 years is a commitment to a new type of modern agriculture, which takes into account all of the social, economic and environmental realities of the agricultural profession."
"That is the type of agriculture which is the aim of the agreement reached in this House and that can only be welcomed, although it is surprising how different positions were not long ago."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) Since industrialisation, food prices have been kept artificially low, which has also enabled industrial wages to remain low."
"Since then, farmers have been forced to produce more and more for ever decreasing rewards."
"The EU subsidy system was a means of achieving greater economies of scale and increasing production per hectare."
"Revenues from taxes go some way towards compensating farmers for their lack of income."
"The survival of small-scale farmers and villages in southern Europe has become highly dependent on this subsidy policy."
"They therefore regard the current common agricultural policy as the best the EU can offer, even if they would like to see funds allocated more fairly."
"They regard every change as a brutal, neoliberal attack."
"They are afraid that a new system will only serve as a subsidy on land ownership and land speculation and will not be able to stop the depopulation of the countryside."
"In northern Europe, on the other hand, most of the small farmers have already been 'cleared away', and public opinion regards the agricultural funds as a kind of bureaucracy, a waste of money and environmental pollution which must be brought to an end as soon as possible."
"I did and do agree with the demand to switch from production subsidies to income guarantees and the protection of the landscape."
"The current proposal, however, seems to be primarily aimed at winning over the Americans in the WTO with a view to exporting other EU products."
"."
"The vast majority of reports we have just voted upon I can support and agree with."
"Jeggle and Souchet often cause me little problems but Mr Cunha's report is different."
"The current CAP, which has been reformed on many different occasions down the years, has become top-heavy with red tape and bureaucracy, and I rather feel that what we are proposing is to heap more misery on top of what already exists."
"What do we have now?"
"De-coupling, modulation, degressivity and cross-compliance in place of good farming practice and an honest return for honest endeavours."
"I sincerely believe that partial de-coupling will prove to be the worst of all worlds and provide no encouragement for the industry in the future, or do anything to streamline the industry or encourage young people to make a career in agriculture."
"This will immediately mean more controls and inspections and less time for the farmer to tend his stock."
"I will vote against to ensure that in the longer term the Northern Ireland agriculture industry is not destroyed in the name of efficiency."
"The British Conservatives voted against the Commission proposal as amended, but in favour of the legislative resolution. We did this, not because we support the contents of Parliament's report, but because it is imperative that Parliament gives an opinion so that Council may proceed to a decision."
"Europe's farmers must be given a clear direction for the future."
"We support Commissioners Fischler's proposals to reform the CAP and believe it is long overdue."
"We are completely behind the plans to decouple payments away from production, and welcome the freeing up of agriculture."
"We also believe that the Fischler proposals will ensure the future of European agriculture in an enlarged Europe of 25 Member States."
"The proposals as they are in Parliament's text would only confuse and complicate an already over-bureaucratic system, and force agriculture into even further decline."
"The Commission reforms will put us in a strong position when we sit around the table at the WTO talks in Cancun."
"We hope that Commissioner Fischler sticks to his guns, and pushes ahead with his plans in Luxembourg next week."
"We, and European farmers, wish him every success!"
"There is no doubt that the EU's agricultural aid must be reformed with a view to creating a healthy world market."
"Unfortunately, the proposal for reform does not address the issue of export subsidies which, in our opinion, are what it is most important to change and which have the most thoroughly distorting effect upon world markets and upon poor countries' ability to exploit their comparative advantages."
"The Commission's proposal does, however, acknowledge the multifunctionality of agriculture and would make increased modulation possible, that is to say increased flexibility when it comes to supporting tasks other than actual food production, such as the conservation of biodiversity and the cultivated landscape, or to taking other types of environmental measure."
"It would also make it easier for other reforms to be implemented further down the line."
"At the same time, decoupling presents obvious risks of disengagement and resistance to change which would, for example, obstruct the badly needed transition from one generation to the next within the agricultural community."
"From these two perspectives, the European Parliament's proposal is therefore a compromise, providing scope for further necessary changes in the future."
"Overall, we have therefore chosen, despite many objections, to support the report in the final vote."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."
"The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another."
"The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
". We fully support the Commission's original proposal for CAP reform as set out and unamended by the European Parliament, with the exception of Amendments 38 and 99, referring to health and safety."
"The CAP must be reformed."
"Payments must be subject to mandatory cross-compliance with the environment, rural economy, and animal welfare Directives."
"The position adopted by the European Parliament will perpetuate a system which is damaging to the environment, the rural economy and animal welfare, and prejudices high levels of health and safety and harms produce in the developing world."
"(PT) Rural development might appear to be a panacea for all the problems and imbalances affecting the various types of agriculture in the EU, but it is also one strand of the strategy to contain CAP spending and to liberalise agricultural markets, in conjunction with enlargement and negotiations at the World Trade Organisation."
"The aim of market mechanisms, however, is to bolster prices, and, primarily, income, ignoring the need to resolve existing deep-seated injustices."
"Rural development cannot exist without farmers and agricultural production."
"The Commission proposal does not increase appropriations for rural development. Instead, it transfers some of the appropriations from the 'markets' pillar, which will mean some of the CAP's costs being renationalised."
"The proposals contained in this report are broadly to be welcomed, although they uphold the original framework."
"Our vote reflects the improvements the report makes, particularly: the support it provides for less-favoured areas, for young farmers, for women in rural areas, for promoting agricultural production and for increasing the amounts of aid under the various instruments, including our proposal for a EUR 100 increase for compensatory allowances for the less-favoured regions."
"(PT) I congratulate Mr Olsson on the excellent report he has produced on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000. I fully support this report, especially with regard to the need to help establish conditions for developing farming in the EU regions that are the weakest and which face the greatest problems."
"This will enable us to prevent the exodus of these communities from the countryside, and support the preservation of the landscape and consequently of the environment, whilst attempting to improve the standard of living of the communities in those regions."
"I also wish to emphasise that the European Parliament must always support the development of a farming policy that respects the environment, making support a priority only for farmers who comply with Community rules, and for young people wishing to become farmers."
"It should be emphasised that this is also a means of promoting employment in Europe."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."
"The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another."
"The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
". (PT) This proposal for a regulation for the cereals sector highlights the strategy of the latest CAP reforms: lower prices and the gradual deregulation of the markets."
"Compensation for income is only partial, with direct aid covering 50% of the fall in prices."
"This strategy promotes the concentration and intensification of production and greater farm size, increasing the desertification of the rural world."
"Furthermore, a 45% reduction in cereal prices has led to an increased cost to the budget of EUR 630 million."
"We have supported some of the rapporteur's proposals, specifically the inclusion of rye on the list of cereals eligible for intervention and the references made to protecting the Community preference, but we do not accept the principle of decoupling aid from production for the cereals sector."
"We also reject the idea of aid for the potato starch sector, which supports huge food corporations from only a few Member States, when what is really needed is regulation and support for potatoes for consumption."
"A wide-ranging reform of the CAP has become necessary, guaranteeing similar levels of support and market regulation for Mediterranean produce."
"Unless this happens, we will not be able to remedy the profound injustices in the distribution of aid and we will be sending the wrong message to producers in regions and countries with climatic conditions that are more suited to other types of production."
"The Commission's proposal follows on from the 1992 revision and abides by the philosophy of reducing intervention prices by 5.9% and partly compensating for these reductions with direct per-hectare aid."
"This proposal serves the interests of the wheat trading and processing industries by ensuring they have cheap raw materials."
"At the same time, wheat producers' incomes are being reduced, because there is 50% rather than full compensation, prices and compensation remain constant and are not adjusted on the basis of average Community inflation and, finally, with the proposal to abolish monthly increases in the intervention price, the average intervention price is being reduced."
"The amendments proposed by the rapporteur of the European Parliament move in a more positive direction than the Commission's proposals, with the exception of the reference to durum wheat which is, however, regulated under another regulation."
"In essence, however, they move in the same direction as the Commission's proposal and only differ on quantitative elements, without contesting or proposing measures which reverse the Commission's basic philosophy, and this, despite the correct findings, ultimately renders the report ineffective, the gilding on a policy which favours the interests of the multinationals at the expense of small and medium-sized farmers."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."
"The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another."
"The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
". (PT) This proposal for a regulation seeks to phase out the common organisation of the market in the dried fodder sector from the 2008/2009 marketing year onwards."
"The Commission's reasoning turns on environmental issues, specifically the use of fossil fuel for dehydrating and even the use of irrigation."
"Environmental issues can be resolved by other means, however, such as plans to reduce fossil energy, natural predrying in the sun or the use of renewable energies."
"Nevertheless, we must view this sector as yet another source of vegetable protein production, in which the European Union has a growing shortage that already stands at 35 million tonnes of soya equivalent."
"In other words, the EU is meeting only 23% of its vegetable protein needs. This situation will be exacerbated after enlargement."
"The consequence of losing this form of production is that we have to import, mainly from the USA, two million tonnes of soya meal equivalent, with all the risks of GMO contamination that this entails."
"Accordingly, whilst acknowledging the importance of the environmental factor, we agreed with the rapporteur on the need to continue with the present CMO, to strengthen market instruments and to increase total aid to EUR 68 per tonne from the marketing year 2004/2005 onwards."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."

". (PT) The rice sector is currently experiencing difficulties as a result of the imbalances triggered by the simultaneous increase in internal production and the rise in imports, due to the preferences and customs reductions of recent years."
"This situation is likely to get worse with the fall in customs tariffs resulting from implementation of the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, with the forthcoming WTO round and with the possibilities of 'triangulation' and abuses of inward processing arrangements."
"There is, furthermore, a conflict of interest between the producer Member States of the South and the consumer Member States of northern Europe, whose consumers tend to prefer the Indian variety of rice, of which the EU is in short supply."
"This proposal for a regulation is unacceptable."
"The Commission is proposing a 50% reduction in the basic intervention price to a basic price of EUR 150 per tonne, compensation at a level of 88% of that applied to cereals under previous reforms and a limit on quantity, overlooking the specific characteristics of this monoculture, which is concentrated in areas that have specific characteristics, with no opportunity for alternative production."
"The proposal also overlooks the fact that this crop entails some of the highest costs in the farming sector in terms of investment in machinery, equipment and installations, which are mostly custom-made. This means that forcing rice-growers to change crops would cause them serious financial difficulties."
"We have therefore sided with the rapporteur."
". (EL) The objective of the Commission proposal is to diminish Community production and increase imports from third countries."
"Rice is cultivated on pathogenic soils in the ?U and Greece for which it is difficult to find an alternative solution."
"Thus, we consider unacceptable the quota of 203,000 hectares proposed for Greece, which is less than the previous quota, which we more than covered."
"The proposed measures reduce the income of rice producers by increasing the profits of the trading industries, which will buy raw materials at derisory prices, given that the intervention prices will have a proportionate knock-on effect on commercial prices, without compensating for this reduction, despite the Commission's allegations to the contrary, allegations which are groundless, given that the rate of compensation is calculated on the basis of the difference between the intervention price before the revision and the private storage price after the revision."
"The rapporteur's amendments, although more positive, are ultimately out of kilter with his objective findings about the state of this sector."
"He disagrees with the abolition of intervention, but accepts the drastic 50% reduction in intervention prices, which in essence cancels it out."
"He confirms the problem of abundant imports, but does not differentiate from the Commission's quotas."
"That is why, and because his proposals exacerbate rather than radically improve the situation, we shall not be voting in favour of the report."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."

"In this proposal for a regulation, the Commission proposes to prolong a reformed dairy quota system until the 2014/15 marketing year, and says nothing about the future."
"Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income."
"The end of the quota system, which is what the large countries producing a surplus would like to see, would mean the liberalisation of the sector, greater concentration of production and a considerable reduction in prices, which would harm in particular small and medium-sized producers from the least productive and less-favoured regions."
"Across-the-board quota increases must, therefore, be considered for all countries and practical measures must be adopted to combat the concentration of production, both at regional level and in the hands of a few producers."
"Account must be taken, however, of specific situations such the current state of affairs in Portugal, particularly in the outermost region of the Azores, where a quota increase must be guaranteed in order not to penalise a sector that has significant socio-economic ramifications, in a region that faces major structural disadvantages."
". (DE) I am to a large extent in agreement with the reports on the organisation of the milk market, because the quota arrangements are being retained until 2014 as an instrument to regulate production and guarantee prices, which will give the reliability that is so essential for the continued existence of the family farm and will give farmers the security to enable them to plan accordingly."
"However, I am in favour of those proposals on the reports concerning the milk sector that quite rightly point out that it is in the disadvantaged areas in particular that milk production plays a vitally important role, and that for this reason, when deciding on the basis for calculating the milk subsidy, the special situation of individual Member States should be taken into consideration by the differentiated lowering of the intervention price for butter and skimmed milk powder."
"In the areas in question an extra EUR 5 per tonne should be paid in subsidies."
"I should also like to say, about the agricultural reports overall, that I am not entirely convinced that the compulsion to take action is so great that we should have to shoot all our bolts now, in one go, before the next round of negotiations in Cancun, thereby running the risk of having to make even greater concessions which would lead to the demolition of the common agricultural policy and with it the demise of the small farmer in large parts of Europe."
"Finally, the farm budget has been set up until 2013, which is why the budget-policy constraints that we are always hearing about are not present to the extent that is repeatedly asserted by the Commission and even here in Parliament."
". (EL) The proposals for the milk sector perpetuate the unequal treatment of countries such as Greece by keeping quotas at unacceptably low levels, exacerbating their dependency in dairy products and ruining producers with huge coresponsibility levies, due to the unacceptably low quotas allocated to them."
"The ?U prefers to strengthen intervention, by withdrawing excess dairy products from oversaturated markets, mainly in the northern countries, than to direct the sums which will be spent on intervention to covering the needs of countries, such as Greece, which cannot meet even half their domestic demand."
"It is infuriating that the quota granted in compensation for the reduction in target prices is increased by a larger percentage in the developed and a smaller percentage in the less developed countries."
"For example, the proposals make provision for Greece for an increase in the quota of 6 000 - 14 000 tonnes and for 335 000 - 110 000 for Holland."
"The country's livestock farming is being condemned to stagnation and the Greeks are obliged to consume imported pasteurised products because fresh milk does not reach the country in time, despite the fact that there is the potential to increase production and meet its requirements."
"We call for a fair redistribution of quotas, on the basis of population criteria, consumption requirements and production potential, which is why we shall vote against the reports, which move in a diametrically opposed direction."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."
"The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another."
"The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
". (PT) Milk production is of fundamental importance in the less favoured regions."
"It is therefore crucial that minimum prices cover labour and production costs and that family farming and land-based undertakings are protected."
"The transfer of production rights without land and lower prices, together with the absence of practical measures for regions with specific difficulties (such as the closure of joint milking parlours, the lack of support for the costs of transporting milk in inland or mountainous areas, etc.), have all led to the concentration of production and to thousands of farmers abandoning their land, specifically in Portugal."
"We reject the Commission's proposal to reduce target prices by 28% over the next five marketing years."
"The lack of measures for combating the concentration of production and speculation on the economic value of milk quotas is unacceptable, as is the fact that no provision is made for updating the level of fat content in order to adjust it to the real average."
"We agree with the rapporteur's proposals for intervention prices to be increased with regard to the Commission proposal, for total compensation for price reductions by means of direct payments and especially with the supplementary subsidy of EUR 5 per tonne for the less favoured regions."
"We disagree, however, with the proposal to eliminate indicative prices."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."

"The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
". (PT) More has been said today than ever before about multifunctionality in agriculture, particularly in the context of the current CAP reform."
"It even appears that many people have only now discovered agriculture's multifunctional nature. Farm production has always entailed positive externalities for the development of the rural world, contributing to job creation, to the development of other upstream economic activities, to regional planning, the preservation of the environment, the landscape and the cultural heritage."
"There must therefore be policies that promote an extensive and tightly-knit network of small and medium-sized family farms and the development of local and regional markets."
"This CAP, even with its reforms, clearly bears the greatest responsibility for destroying multifunctionality in agriculture, through the gradual liberalisation of farm markets."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur, who states that rather than 'declarations of intent' what are needed are concrete measures relating to the CAP, which the Commission's proposals for reforming the CAP fail to provide."
"We support the rapporteur's proposals but regret the fact that she was not more ambitious."
"(PT) I congratulate Mrs Rodriguez Ramos on her excellent report on multifunctionality in farming and the reform of the CAP. I fully support this report, in particular with regard to calling for a European agricultural policy that also takes account of the multiple functions of farming, specifically maintaining the rural population, regional planning and the preservation of the environment, the landscape and the cultural heritage, also introducing the concept of territorial cohesion."
"I also wish to underline that the European Parliament prides itself on its action to ensure respect for Europe's diversity, which means that where farming is concerned, we have a duty also to consider the non-commercial aspects in order to achieve the harmonious development of the European Union."
"My initial comment on the new agricultural policy announced by Commissioner Fischler on 10 July 2002 was: 'An appropriate break with the past, but not a solution for the victims by a long chalk'."
"The reform was announced as a reward for quality and food safety, aimed at better protection of the consumer and the environment."
"Maintaining and improving the countryside would be less dependent on chasing after ever more intensive production."
"My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, has always striven to achieve just such a reversal."
"Agricultural organisations and farmers' representatives in the European Parliament were furious."
"This is understandable, as there is unfortunately a major risk of more large groups of farmers going out of business."
"Not only the small farmers in France, Spain and Greece, but even the bigger farmers in the Netherlands, who are currently highly dependent on the money they have borrowed from the banks."
"Compared with the amount of work and money they have invested, their income is disappointing, and that income may drop even further for some."
"Farmers can only get socio-economic security if we have the courage to break away from the logic of the free market and instead are rewarded for countryside management, environmental protection and healthy food."
"Otherwise there will still be pressure to supply food even more cheaply than the Americans and other competitors outside the EU by further intensification, further exploitation of the soil and export subsidies."
". (PT) I believe that multifunctionality in farming must have a place in the process of reforming the CAP, and I think that the Council and the Commission must accept this idea."
"The social, environmental and territorial effects of farming have not, in fact, been given the attention they deserve by the Community institutions, whose farming policies have largely focused on qualitative and economic issues."
"It would only be fair to emphasise that the hard-to-measure public goods and positive externalities that result from conventional farming far exceed its direct economic benefits."
"It is therefore right that particular attention should be paid to the rural population, that practical measures falling outside the sphere of rural development should be adopted and that the preservation of farming should be encouraged and supported, given the importance at local level of farms. Production must also be geared towards sustainable and high-quality development."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's view that the need to deal with the unpredictable swings of competition in a market in the process of being liberalised must be compatible with the crucial presence of a sufficient number of farmers to ensure proper countryside management."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests."
"The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods."
"Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens."
"The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another."
"The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I should like to make the following comments about the Oostlander report."
"We have agreed to this report, because it would be a way of bringing Turkey closer to European standards."
"However, we attach importance to the conclusion that this report should not automatically be the start of anything."
"With regard to Turkey's possible accession to the European Union, many members of our group do not share the view that it should join the European Union, although naturally we would like to have close and friendly relations with it as a partner."
"To that extent we believe it is important to state, having given our agreement to the Oostlander report, that, if and when it comes to a decision on Turkey's membership of the European Union, it will be up to individuals to decide freely, that any such decision lies in the future, and that our agreement to the Oostlander report in no way forms a preliminary decision anticipating any such decision that may be taken in the future."
"We chose to vote in favour of the report, despite the rejection of our proposal to delete the wording to the effect that 'the political values of the European Union are chiefly based on the Judaeo-Christian and humanist culture of Europe'."
"We do not like the wording, but because the rest of the report is constructive, we chose to vote in favour of it."
". (PT) We do not endorse the content of various points or phrases contained in the resolution including, amongst other aspects, its reference to what it calls the 'Judaeo-Christian and humanist culture of Europe' or to Turkey's commitments to NATO."
"The resolution details a set of extremely important issues, such as the ban on the activities of various political organisations, the issue of the amnesty granted to political prisoners, the practice of torture and other forms of violence and repression, the army's control of political life in the country and the military occupation of northern Cyprus and Turkey's failure to apply the UN resolutions there."
"Only the day before yesterday, my parliamentary group drew up an initiative on the situation in Turkey, in which various human rights organisations were involved."
"One of the main ideas expressed in the initiative is that - despite the individual changes to the constitution and to legislation that these organisations have welcomed, although in practice some have not really been applied - we must not soften our condemnation of the violence and arbitrary behaviour by the Turkish authorities, and we must step up our solidarity with all those who resist and fight."
"For our part, we shall continue to support all initiatives of this type."
". British Labour Euro MPs have supported this resolution because we believe it is essential to recognise the reforms achieved by the Turkish Government, and to give a positive signal of encouragement for further change on their path towards accession in to the European Union."
"However, we condemn the reference to one particular religious tradition within the resolution, because we believe this is inconsistent with the multi-ethnic, multi-faith society which is the reality for all of our countries."
"In addition, we want to put on record what we believe are misrepresentations in some of the text."
"First, in relation to recital D and paragraph 24, we should recognise that there are a range of electoral systems used in the different European countries, and in fact around one-quarter of current MPs in Turkey are from Kurdish origin. Second, in relation to paragraph 3, whilst reiterating our strong desire on progress in relation to Cyprus, we point out that this has never been made a direct precondition for Turkish EU accession - and it is wrong to change that in this resolution."
"On paragraph 19, our understanding is that the Loizidou case has now been resolved - and this should be welcomed."
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (EL) The members of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report on the accession of Turkey to the ?U because we believe that it will not benefit the workers and the people of Turkey in general; it will only benefit the Turkish plutocracy and the EU."
"Many believe that the accession of Turkey will contribute towards its democratisation."
"That belief led to customs union, to its being proclaimed a candidate country, but not to democratisation."
"The repression of its people continued, with the gaols full of political detainees in inhumane conditions."
"Arrests, torture and murder continue."
"The muzzling of political opposition extends to banning parties such as the Turkish Communist Party and HADEP."
"DEHAP is about to be banned."
"The army continues to play a sovereign role and there is the daily threat of a coup d'état."
"Its militia continue to occupy 37% of Cyprus."
"The rapporteur does indeed recognise much of the above, but he welcomes the government for its good intentions and proposes speeding up the financing of Turkey with EU taxpayers' money, which will most probably be used to reinforce the repressive mechanisms."
"We condemn the hypocritical policy of the ?U, which is based above all on serving big interests and we stand by those fighting, under harsh conditions, for democracy, peace and social progress in Turkey, certain that radical change will come as their fight develops."
"A new party surprisingly came to power in Turkey last year."
"Thanks to the 10 percent threshold for obtaining representation in Parliament, this party immediately won a majority, and only one other party remained, that of the more or less social democratic followers of Atatürk."
"The new premier, Erdogan, has been depicted as an extremist in the past and has been disenfranchised."
"He is now regarded as the leader of the Muslim Democrats, which is supposed to be roughly the same as Christian Democrats in other countries."
"You would expect a new governing party like this to take a critical view of the fact that Turkey has a considerable number of political prisoners, that parties are banned, that the army retains much power and that the very large Kurdish population group still does not have normal rights to government, education, the administration of justice, employment and media in their own language."
"Up to now this government has also refused to acknowledge these problems and seems not to be doing very much about them."
"It is therefore good that Turkey cannot enter into preliminary negotiations about EU membership without conditions, on the basis of the illusion that everything will automatically be better then."
"The report could have been clearer and stronger, but I support the idea that Turkey will be able to join once it has become a democracy."
". (PT) According to the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, the aim of the open method of coordination is 'to disseminate best practice and ensure greater convergence towards the main EU goals'."
"The way in which OMC has been applied, however, reveals certain weaknesses."
"Hence the need for clarification, specifically in defining the matters to which it should apply; in mobilising all national players to ensure that participation in the process is not wholly confined to a small elite; in coordinating it with other Community instruments, making this method a complement to legislation and not 'alternative legislation in disguise'."
"This is why we should give our support to the recommendation to include in the future Constitutional Treaty an article specifically relating to OMC, defining its form and procedures."
"I also welcome the call for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to be consulted on issues that fall within its sphere of competence and I recognise the merit of the European Commission's drawing up a study on the effectiveness of the method."
"The proposed measures will certainly help to improve OMC and I have therefore voted in favour of this excellent report."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of the report, and welcome the initiative by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I agree with the rapporteur when (in response to the views put forward by the Convention's four working groups) she calls for the open method of coordination to be defined more clearly and to be included in the Treaty."
"Each national report must indicate how representatives of civil society, including the social partners, and local, regional and national authorities, including the Parliament, have been consulted."
"I have always stood up for and emphasised the importance of the irreplaceable role at local level of national parliaments and communities (specifically those that are involved or targeted) in forming and expressing the 'Community will', because this does not correspond to a federalist vision of a supposed 'European will'. It is instead the result of a 'desire to understand', a composition of disparate interests, a convergence of values and aims."
"Sharing best practices, which forms part of the open method of coordination, is, therefore, an approach that needs to be improved, developed and extended to other areas, because of the useful effect it has had on employment policies."
"This approach could lead to genuine convergence and could benefit everyone, without entailing the more or less imposed nature of legislation."
"Lastly, I have also supported the suggestion to ask the Commission to draw up a study on the method's effectiveness."
"Mr President, we have just approved the Fraisse report on women in top-level sport."
"I am, however, somewhat concerned about what we voted on in paragraph 10, in which we call on the European Union to provide financial support for the operation of the European Women and Sport network, as I was under the impression that this was a private organisation of which a nephew of Mrs Fraisse is the chairman or at least plays a major role."
"In my opinion it is not right that Mrs Fraisse does not disclose these interests."
"Before something like this is done by the Commission, I would like us to establish whether any of this is true, because we do not believe that this is a particularly important organisation."
"Although the text does not state clearly whether it is a private organisation or not, we looked into this, and this is apparently indeed the case."
"I actually think this is unfair."
"Various Members of this Parliament had questions on this, but we did not place this on the agenda in the plenary session for reasons of discretion."
"I would nevertheless like all this to be investigated."
". (PT) Sport is a sector in which major inequalities between men and women still exist."
"I therefore agree with this report and support the initiatives intended to reduce unequal treatment in terms of the income, financial resources and vocational retraining of top-level athletes."
"Women's participation must be promoted in positions of leadership, in technical and medical teams and on refereeing and adjudication boards."
"Particular attention must be paid to the effects of sport on athletes' health, to preventing and combating sexual abuse and harassment and to increasing media coverage of women's sport."
"Sport in schools is clearly in decline."
"The role of physical and sports education must be emphasised and included in suitable training for teachers and measures must be adopted to enable women to practise sports in their spare time and develop opportunities for practising at their workplace."
"Lastly, women's participation in sport must be promoted in Community programmes and actions, and the appropriate human and financial resources must be provided, as well as the necessary mechanisms for monitoring and following up these actions."
"This week the European Parliament is voting on two reports by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Seldom have I seen such a big difference in quality between reports from one committee."
"The report on breast cancer in the European Union is excellent, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has therefore voted in favour of this."
"The report on women in sport states that sport is an expression of the right to equality and the freedom of all women."
"The European Commission is being asked to set up a 'women and sport' unit; television stations would have to undertake to broadcast more women's sports, and they are even calling for sport in the workplace to be regulated in collective labour agreements!"
"Women's sport is very good, but that does not make it a fundamental right."
"Sport seems to me to be something that people simply have to do and not something that should be imposed by the European Parliament."
"The ELDR Group has therefore voted against this report."
"."
"(PT) Sport is an activity that has many virtues, such as developing team spirit and learning to help one another in team sports, a good way to use leisure time, clear health benefits, and the opportunities it provides for learning the importance of obeying rules and for developing a sense of ethics, for example."
"All initiatives to promote sport are, therefore, always welcome."
"In line with the old adage 'a healthy mind in a healthy body', sport must start at school and it is extremely important that everyone, both men and women, enjoys identical conditions, which are also appropriate to their level of involvement."
"The under-representation of women in decision-making on sporting matters in sports federations and associations is not a problem specific to sport, but is an issue that needs to be duly addressed in this area too."
"The Union must encourage women's participation, although we believe that some of the proposals constitute excessive interference, both in the competence of the Member States and in sports associations' ability to manage their own affairs - in other words, a dual breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
". (FR) I have to admit that this report already has one merit: it amused me."
"The title, 'Women and Sport', might itself have been confusing, but the content is entirely beyond comprehension!"
"I have read and reread this crazy report and I have still not grasped the ins and outs of it."
"I did pick out some classic passages, on access to sport as a fundamental right, on sport as a highly sexual and stereotyped area where the dominant models of virility and femininity are reproduced but also broken, and on socially discriminatory and sexually stereotyped treatment by the media, which leave us speechless."
"But no, I can definitely find no justification for this report other than enabling an MEP to indulge in a style exercise that is worthy of the greatest humorists, So after 'Women and Sport' roll on a report on 'Sport and sexual minorities'!"
"Who was it who said that 'in politics, talking without saying anything and not saying anything for the sake of talking are the two major principles of those who would be better to keep their mouths closed'?"
". (PT) The incidence of breast cancer has been steadily increasing."
"The report that has just been adopted argues that the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of the disease must be improved."
"According to the WHO, 216 000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the European Union in 2000, and in that year 79 000 women died of the disease."
"This is the most common cancer in women, affecting one in nine and is the most common cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 55."
"The risk of developing breast cancer is 60% higher in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe, hence the proposal to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the average breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU."
"The Member States are invited to offer all women aged between the ages of 50 and at least 69 a mammography every two years, as laid down in the European Directives on Guaranteeing the Quality of Mammographic Screening, since only eight of the fifteen Member States currently have national screening programmes."
"All women suffering from this form of cancer must have the right to be treated by multidisciplinary teams."
"Hence our vote in favour of the report."
". (PT) I congratulate the rapporteur on this report, which is so important and timely."
"Its importance and timeliness are confirmed by data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which states that in 2000 more than 79 000 women died from breast cancer."
"The broad majority achieved in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities also confirms the aptness of the report's content, since there were only two abstentions and no votes against it."
"Amongst the rapporteur's suggestions, I would highlight making the fight against breast cancer a priority for health policy, implementing a two-yearly screening model for all women between the ages of 50 and 69 and the regular attendance of doctors and paramedical staff on further training courses."
"Something else that will be crucial is a clear commitment to cure this and other types of cancer."
"I, like many others, believe that cancer remains the real 'disease of the century', which must be given priority."
"Mr President, I am in something of a crisis as far as the Rules of Procedure are concerned."
"We are dealing here with explanations of vote."
"We now have written explanations of vote."
"They are used to ensure that Parliament does not have to deal with everything."
"We now come to Explanation 5/2003."
"In the English version, there is a reference to 'crimes', while the German version has 'Verbrechen'."
"In the German text a Verbrechen is an offence (Straftat) carrying a penalty of at least one year's imprisonment."
"I believe this to be too strong a term, and therefore when I signed I added, 'I sign this subject to the reservation that the correct translation would be Straftat'."
"The same problem occurs in Danish: Forbrydelser also means Verbrechen."
"I would ask you to pass on the question to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure as to how we should proceed in such a case."
"The interpreter was in despair and said that 260 people had already signed and he could not now replace the German and Danish language versions."
"In any case I should like to make it quite clear for the Minutes that my signature was not given for Verbrechen, but for the correct translation of the English word 'crime', which is Straftat, a term that includes both Verbrechen and Vergehen."
"I do not know what the original language version was, but the normal procedure is to ensure that all versions correspond to the original language."
"We have noted the point you have made."
"Mr President, I am entitled to make both a personal statement and a statement concerning the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr van Hulten has invited me to respect democratic decisions."
"It was a democratic decision of this House that this report should be dealt with this afternoon."
"Therefore it is not I who have gone against a democratic decision."
"Secondly, you have taken Rule 145 as your basis, and I should like to draw your attention to Rule 145(2), which states quite clearly, 'If the proposal or request is carried, only one member may speak from each political group which has not yet provided a speaker in that debate'."
"That means that, if Rule 145 had really been applied, an opportunity to speak would have had to be given to one Member from each group!"
"I am therefore really asking that these things should be clarified."
"The clarification is simple."
"Every single speaker in the debate had withdrawn, so there was no debate anyway."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.51 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The Minutes have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"I will also be able to confirm that you were present."
"The next item is the report (A5-0157/2003) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman on relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law [COM(2002) 141 - C5-0288/2002 - 2002/2148(COS)]."
"Mr President, respect for Community law is a fundamental part of the future of Europe."
"The European Commission, which has to ensure that Community law is applied, has to maintain special relations with citizens who are witnesses to, or the actual or alleged victims of, violations of Community law and who lodge complaints with its services."
"The communication that inspired this report demonstrates the Commission's desire for transparency and efficiency."
"As it committed to doing, it publishes in consolidated form its internal rules of procedure governing its relations with the complainant."
"It also ensures that it keeps in contact with the complainant throughout the investigation of his complaint according to a strict schedule."
"It was following an own initiative report and criticisms made against the European Ombudsman when a complaint was closed, and also repeated requests from the European Parliament, that the European Commission has reconsidered its administrative methods for dealing with relations with the complainant."
"It should be noted that the Commission enjoys discretionary powers with regard to assessing complaints and deciding whether or not to commence infringement proceedings and to refer a case to the Court of Justice."
"This is not, therefore, about reconsidering the way in which complaints are handled but about enabling citizens to be informed, in particular about the progress of the examination of their complaints."
"We note with satisfaction that the Commission's proposal is entirely a step in the right direction."
"We consider that the administrative measures taken by the Commission as regards the consideration of complaints are particularly welcome and that they allow complainants to be regularly informed of the stage reached in the proceedings."
"Moreover, we regard the maximum one-year period that the Commission has undertaken to comply with in order to respond to each case as entirely reasonable, given the number of complaints lodged and their complexity."
"The only point that seems to me to be missing from this communication, however, is the situation when a complaint and a petition are lodged at the same time."
"As you know, the Commission is not the only institution to respond to citizen's questions regarding the proper functioning of the institutions and the correct application of Community law."
"The European Ombudsman and the European Parliament, through its Committee on Petitions, also receive an increasing number of complaints."
"A complaint lodged by a citizen may therefore also be the subject of a petition to Parliament lodged by the same citizen."
"This is when two complaints are lodged at the same time, each of them being treated differently according to the institution with which it was lodged, according to a different timetable, which, you will understand, is a source of confusion for both citizens and the institutions themselves."
"It seems both desirable and logical for decisions made by Community institutions regarding complaints, appeals or petitions to be coordinated between the institutions concerned in order to provide an effective service for citizens."
"This is why we are urging the Commission to revise the interinstitutional agreement, which dates from 1989."
"It should also be considered that this was when the position of Ombudsman was introduced and the right of petition was recognised in many Member States, which considerably increased the number of appeal cases."
"Despite all of the Commission's competence in processing complaints, citizens should still use the Committee on Petitions, which considers and responds to the problems raised in a more political way, but the Commission and Parliament obviously complement each other in order to ensure the effective service required."
"Moreover, the need for information is going to increase in the years to come, with the arrival of ten new Member States in the Community."
"Allow me to finish by mentioning something very promising that the Commission has done: creating Solvit."
"The purpose of Solvit is to settle, very quickly - and when I say very quickly I mean within ten weeks, with four additional weeks in the event of additional problems- recurrent cross-border problems concerning the internal market, and to prevent legal actions."
"What is different about Solvit is that it involves Member States in a partnership with the Commission for investigating the case."
"This is evidence of integration, which is enjoying growing success, and the Commission is to be congratulated on this progress, the ultimate aim of which is to make life simpler for citizens in terms of respect for Community law."
". Mr President, the Commission is pleased to note that Mrs Fourtou's draft report welcomes the communication on relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law."
"This communication serves two purposes."
"The first is to raise public awareness of the procedural rules which apply to complaints handled by the Commission."
"The second is to tighten internal discipline as regards notification given to complainants at the main stages of proceedings, including, where appropriate, when cases are closed."
"The Commission is ready to work with Parliament to examine ways of improving coordination of the two bodies' response to state measures which are incompatible with Community law, such measures being brought to the institution's attention either via petitions or complaints."
"Mr President, it is well known, and those of us who are members of the Committee on Petitions have been well aware of it for some time now, that this Parliament and the institution of European Ombudsman are not overly happy about the way in which the Commission has been handling complaints by European citizens."
"There have frequently been many criticisms in this respect."
"Therefore, the Ombudsman, in relation to a complaint concerning the Macedonian Joint Venture, stated at the time that the Commission would have to reconsider its operating methods in respect of complaints by citizens, in other words in respect of the intercommunication between the Commission and European citizens."
"So now we have this communication from the Commission, which recognises that the handling of this intercommunication requires a better framework, mainly from an administrative point of view, in the area of permanent personal contact with the citizens who have submitted the complaint or petition, and in the area of the classification of complaints, treating them properly and reasonably."
"The report by Mrs Fortou has arrived in this context, and I would like to congratulate her on her work."
"The agreement must be maintained up to the end."
"We call on the Commission to welcome the proposals in this report, which make a great deal of sense."
"I reiterate, therefore, that we give our full backing to this report, and to the Commission we say that we are at a particularly opportune and interesting moment, coinciding as it does with the accession of 10 further Member States, to pursue this action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on her report and to thank her."
"My group is of the opinion that the Commission communication is a step in the right direction, since it recognises how important the role of complainant is in the exposure of infringements of Community law."
"The Commission must welcome the citizen as the provider of a service, and must look after citizens' interests."
"Only in this way is trust created, and the feeling conveyed that the EU is a Union for its citizens."
"The citizen must always be shown ways in which he can assert his rights as a citizen of the Union."
"This must also apply to the Commission even if it turns out that the Commission is for once not the right body to which to turn with a complaint."
"The citizen must have the feeling that this is what Europe is, and I say Europe because we must remember that many citizens do not make any distinction between the institutions."
"The citizen must therefore be given an answer. Therefore I particularly welcome the fact that this communication includes this aspect."
"I would have liked the wording to be more clear, however, in particular by stating that the Commission must in all cases show the complainant an alternative means of recourse to law."
"Citizens must be dealt with and informed individually and personally."
"The Commission must inform the complainant immediately and consistently."
"Here it is also important that the complainant really does have the opportunity to present his complaint to the Commission in person and to explain it in more detail."
"The good intentions of the communication must now be put into practice and must not be allowed to remain merely a theory on paper."
"Like the rapporteur, I too am basically of the opinion that the one-year time limit for processing complaints is sufficient."
"That means, however, that the one-year time limit must be the rule and that the citizen is able to rely on really obtaining an answer within one year."
"I do not believe the excuse that the Commission does not have enough staff in order to do this to be a valid one."
"Like Mrs Fourtou, I regret the fact that the communication did not make any connection with the petition procedure."
"For years the Committee on Petitions has been demanding intensified inter-institutional cooperation."
"This has already been referred to in the Perry-Keßler report."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating not only the rapporteur on the report but also the Commission on the communication."
"For us it represents an important step in recognition of the role and legitimate rights of citizens who file a complaint with the Commission."
"It is also the first time the Commission has adopted public rules on how to deal with infringements of Community law by Member States."
"Those public rules are often a marked improvement on the practice in a number of our Member States."
"Secondly, I recall that when the previous Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, asked the Commission to adopt rules on how to treat complainants, his recommendation was to recognise that the complainant was a party to an administrative procedure."
"While my group considers that this should be the final objective, it also considers that the adopted code is a genuine improvement."
"Perhaps there will be an opportunity to advance further through the adoption of an administrative law for the Union's institutions and agencies."
"Thirdly, I want to mention an area on which my colleague, Mr Wyn, and I tabled an amendment which was rejected by the committee - which is unusual because our committee normally shows very good sense."
"The report at the moment states that the Commission enjoys a discretionary power in relation to its consideration of complaints."
"While we recognise that the Commission needs a certain discretion as to if and when it opens an infringement procedure, the discretion has to be used in compliance with the Commission's obligations to ensure that Community law is implemented and applied."
"Article 211, which makes the Commission the guardian of the Treaties, and Article 226, which gives the Commission the right to open infringement procedures, constitute the essential safeguard in the Treaties for the application of the acquis."
"Therefore, we are concerned about this view of the Commission's powers of discretion being extremely wide and would prefer to have them described as providing a certain margin of appreciation."
"Finally, I want to stress, as the Convention is coming to a conclusion, the importance of maintaining the Commission's role in monitoring the implementation of Community law."
"The number of complaints received by the Commission and the number of petitions to Parliament clearly show that citizens need that opportunity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her very short and succinct report."
"It is very much to the point, and that point is that we need more transparency and commitment on the part of the Commission in its administration and towards the citizens of the Union - something that has already been mentioned."
"I believe that a time-limit of one year is not only appropriate, but is even very generous."
"We have Member States where commitment to schedules is the order of the day."
"We should try, together, to get rid of double-tracking when it comes to dealing with complaints."
"That has already been mentioned too."
"That is one of the objectives of this House, and especially of its Committee on Petitions."
"The Commission still has difficulties with administration that is transparent and people-friendly."
"It has happened to every one of us that at some time we have had to defend the relatively small number of officials - some seventeen or eighteen thousand - that the Commission employs, because most of the time they behave towards the public as if they had about a hundred thousand."
"I do not need to remind you of the game of hide-and-seek that the Commission is currently playing in connection with the EUROSTAT scandal, where one has the feeling that the Commission has not yet learned that modern administration has something to do with transparency."
"We only have to look at last year's report by the Ombudsman, which shows that in the year 2002, Commissioner, 75% of complaints were about your institution."
"Of those complaints, there were many that could have been settled relatively easily and at little cost."
"In fact, 27% of the complaints by EU citizens were concerned with lack of transparency and refusal to provide information."
"Once again it boils down to transparency."
"Mr Prodi publicly promised something quite different when he took office three years ago."
"A further 15% of complaints were concerned with avoidable administrative delays."
"The issue of late payments has now become legendary in the Union."
"I believe that there is great potential here for improvement at little cost."
"We just need goodwill, and I think it would be a good idea if we could agree, Commissioner, that, in relation to the commitments that you have entered into, whereby everything will be dealt with within a year, Parliament could receive regular reports from you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates on cases of breaches of human rights."
"The next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0293/2003 by Mr Hartmut Nassauer and Mr Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Indonesia, in particular on Aceh;"
"B5-0298/2003 by Mr Luigi Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Indonesia, most particularly in Papua and Aceh;"
"B5-0301/2003 by Mr Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Indonesia, in particular on Aceh;"
"B5-0302/2003 by Mr Proinsias De Rossa, Mr Martin Schulz, Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath and Mr Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;"
"B5-0307/2003 by Mr Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Indonesia, most particularly in Papua and Aceh;"
"B5-0311/2003 by Mrs Matti Wuori, Mrs Patricia McKenna and Mrs Nelly Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in the provinces of Aceh and Papua, Indonesia."
"Mr President, today we are looking at one of the most difficult foci of crisis in Asia, one that threatens to become ever more dangerous, and we cannot grasp this subject if we merely fall back on the usual clichés."
"Indonesia is a world of many peoples, and, in geographical terms alone, it far exceeds any of our European dimensions."
"In that part of the world one cannot measure everything by the same yardstick."
"We have the problem that Aceh is an ancient historic Sultanate, which has had a significant cultural influence on the region."
"Aceh was a great seafaring nation. Aceh has also had a religious influence on the area."
"It was from there that Islam spread so extensively throughout Asia, and the island has developed a very strong and healthy sense of identity."
"In the colonial period, Aceh, like many other nations in this region, was simply brought into line with all the others and then, after decolonialisation, it became a part of the new artificial State of Indonesia."
"Now we certainly do not want to call into question the integrity of this State of Indonesia, which, on economic and strategic grounds alone, is one of our most important and valuable partners."
"On the other hand, we have to look at the reality of the situation, and the reality is that in Indonesia they have made the mistake of trying to solve the problem of the over-populated islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra by coming up with what is known as the Transmigration Policy, in other words they have tried to resettle people from these islands on other islands with a different cultural and historical make-up, and to outvote other population groups, which has led to a whole range of ethnic and religious conflicts."
"These conflicts are not, as in the Moluccas, simply conflicts between Muslims and Christians, but in Aceh they are also between Muslims and Muslims, or between different ethnic groups."
"For that reason we must approach this subject with great caution."
"On the one hand we must demand, very clearly, an end to the use of force in Aceh and an end to the terrorist activities taking place in the region."
"On the other hand, however, we must also demand that the Government of Indonesia, which is our partner, meets its obligations, and that means fully implementing the autonomy arrangements for Aceh and ensuring that democracy and the rule of law prevail there, and that, above all, humanitarian organisations, international observers and the international media have access to the region."
"Indonesia should have nothing to hide; it is our partner."
"However, the way in which Indonesia deals with the self-aware Aceh province and its freedom is also an important criterion."
"Mr President, the borders of the developing world are largely a product of European colonial administration."
"People who wanted to stay together were split up because the areas they lived in were divided up between colonial occupiers."
"Conversely, people who would have liked to have had an independent state were allotted to large, powerful neighbours who wanted to conquer the areas they lived in."
"It is becoming difficult to change the way countries are divided up in a peaceful manner, particularly if oil or metals have been found in the ground in such areas."
"Indonesia is a product of more than three centuries of Dutch colonialism."
"Five large islands and innumerable small ones were brought together under one administration in order to supply what the nineteenth century author Multatuli called a North Sea robber state with cheap raw materials and commodities."
"The two areas in which the Indonesian army is now trying to destroy separatist movements, Aceh on Northern Sumatra and West Papua, were the last to be added to the Dutch colonial empire."
"They were occupied by the Dutch colonial army as late as 1900, and this was preceded by a bloody war in Aceh."
"The Netherlands had very little interest in the island of New Guinea, which was initially divided between the Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain and which was inhabited by Papuans whose way of life had not changed since ancient times, until Indonesia broke away from the Netherlands in the War of Independence."
"This was the last colonial foothold in Asia at the time."
"The Netherlands had to cede this territory 40 years ago under pressure from America, which was looking to establish good relations with Indonesia."
"The promised referendum for the residents about whether or not to join Indonesia never materialised."
"In 1945 the Netherlands once again tried to divide Indonesia into an independent, densely-populated Java and a number of satellite states in the region linked to the Netherlands."
"Many Indonesians, and certainly their rulers and their military, still regard the fact that they made this split impossible as a great success."
"The powerful role of the Indonesian army, which has been guarding minerals and suppressing ethnic minorities for many years, can be explained by this, as can the long-standing occupation of the former Portuguese Timor and an earlier attempt to annex the former British Malaysia."
"Indonesia's current problems were caused by Europe and America."
"It is therefore a good thing that the European Parliament is concerning itself with these wrongs."
"Unlike in the past, this must not be done through military intervention from outside but through diplomatic, and, if necessary, economic pressure."
"In order to enable the Indonesian peoples to achieve democracy and self-determination, we must always take these causes and sensitivities on board."
"Mr President, the political fragility of the Indonesian confederation is evident."
"The proverbial Emerald Belt is threatening to crumble in its easternmost region, Papua, and in the west in Aceh."
"The countermeasures coming from Jakarta, particularly the military ones, are still producing a reverse effect."
"They are undermining the central authority's promises of autonomy, both in Papua and in Aceh."
"This is encouraging dangerous radicalisation."
"Any escalation of the long-standing conflict between Jakarta and GAM rebels could create a new hotbed of international Islamic terrorism, particularly in Aceh, which has always been very passionate about its independence, as the Dutch know to their cost."
"This terrifying prospect should encourage Jakarta to act tactfully."
"The involvement of the outside world, the Commission and Council, is an absolute must."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, peace and the rule of law in Indonesia have taken a major step backwards, with the breakdown of the ceasefire and renewed hostilities in the province of Aceh on the one hand and with the fresh outbreak of tensions in Irian Jaya, also known as West Papua, on the other."
"Indonesia is one of the world's largest countries, and has the unique feature of suffering not only from the problems arising from its geography and history and, in particular, from the process of decolonisation - to which Mr Meijer referred, and in which lies the root of the problems of the former sultanate of Aceh - but also from the problems posed by Indonesia's brutal repression and dictatorship and by its expansionist approach, which led to the annexation of Irian Jaya and the military takeover of East Timor."
"These two latter facts help us to understand the gravity and complexity of the situation facing that country today."
"The decolonisation of East Timor, which followed the fall of the Suharto dictatorship, represented an historic step in reversing both this internal expansionist intent, which was typical of Indonesia, and the attitude of the western world which had, by commission and by omission, supported the takeover of this small South-East Asian nation, which had only recently come into being."
"As we know, this was not a peaceful action and could only succeed because external military force was used, after the United Nations proved unable to deal with Indonesia's armed response on its own."
"Having said this, and whilst acknowledging that we should not always declare ourselves against any armed action, all the evidence suggests, as indicated in our joint resolution, that we must do everything possible to bring this armed conflict to an end and to ensure that dialogue reopens between the Indonesian Government and the separatist movements in Aceh, as well as the representatives of Irian Jaya."
"Over and above accepting responsibility for all measures necessary to re-establishing the ceasefire in Aceh and dialogue in Irian Jaya, we must also establish an external policy for Indonesia, based on respect for human rights, for minorities and for inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue."
"These principles must furthermore take precedence over geopolitical or economic considerations, which are always poor counsellors in these situations and which have provided such poor results in the past. These principles must also take precedence over determinist considerations such as territorial integrity or the right to self-determination, which are sometimes difficult to define at the outset."
"Aceh never wanted to belong."
"That was the case under Dutch colonial rule, and that has actually never changed."
"For geographic, ethnic, religious and in particular economic reasons."
"Revenues from natural gas are an ongoing source of tension."
"Should this go to the Indonesian Government or to the military, the rebels or the inhabitants themselves?"
"The population has been terrorised, both by the Indonesian military and by the GAM rebels, since 1976."
"From my own experience I know how dangerous it is just to travel from one place to another in this territory."
"Over the years, negotiations between the GAM and the Indonesian military have never delivered anything significant."
"The actual reason for this could well be that both parties have an interest in allowing this anarchistic situation to continue because they both earn well from it."
"After the last negotiations failed, the Indonesian Government proceeded to launch a large-scale military offensive which could easily degenerate into terrible excesses on both sides."
"The Jakarta Government has sworn that it would respect human rights, but who is able to observe that in this mountainous jungle terrain?"
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that international observers go to the area that is adequately protected by the military."
"The European Union must exert all possible pressure on both the Indonesian Government and on the GAM and urge them to arrive at a peaceful settlement with fair arrangements concerning the distribution of minerals."
"Military solutions have never lasted in Aceh."
"It is particularly regrettable that Papua's Special Autonomy Act has been withdrawn and has been replaced by a new law that divides the territory into three provinces."
"It finally seemed as if a solution had been reached which would make everybody happy and would guarantee stability."
"But Mrs Megawati has paid too much attention to the military and does not have the political courage to implement her own will."
"The Papuans no longer want to belong either as a result of this policy, and that cannot have been the intention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the historic circumstances show that we as the European Community cannot remain disinterested with regard to what is happening in Indonesia, Aceh and Papua New Guinea."
"The war which is still continuing and which has been going on for the past 27 years in Aceh shows that the consequences of the colonial era are still having an impact today."
"We must convince the Indonesians that political solutions are the only way to settle these political conflicts."
"A concrete and clear weapons embargo on the Indonesian Government would be an initial step, but we must also be able to convince the Indonesian Government that a country with 150 million inhabitants and so many thousands of islands should not be governed as a unitary entity."
"If there is a will for self-determination and autonomy, both in Aceh and amongst the Papuans, this must be taken into consideration."
"12 000 victims in Aceh, cruelty on a daily basis, infringements of citizens' rights, rapes, attacks on villages; this must be stopped and a political solution must be found."
"In Papua too, they must return to the solution that offers the prospect of autonomy."
"We are not in favour of separate states coming into being everywhere, but we cannot allow a disastrous centralism imposed against the will of the people and by military means to be the ultimate solution."
"This political issue must be resolved in a fair way, so that peace can prevail and so that the natural wealth that is present in such massive quantities can be extracted for the benefit of the entire population and with the participation of those who have been living there for centuries."
"The West must not make itself an accessory to Indonesia's military solutions, but must continue to press consistently for a political solution that offers the prospect of autonomy, even if it is within the framework of an Indonesian state."
"Mr President, Indonesia is currently engaging in its largest military operation since the invasion of East Timor in 1975, against the GAM rebels in Aceh following the breakdown of a five-month-old cease-fire, and already there are reports of widespread suffering and human rights abuses."
"The conflict has its origin in the fact that although the Sultanate of Aceh was never technically incorporated into the Dutch East Indies it was one of the territories handed over by Holland to Indonesia in 1949, following the UN-sponsored talks between Indonesia and the former colonial power."
"The Acehnese, although fellow Muslims, almost immediately began fighting for independence, and the province was given special status."
"The unrest is exacerbated by the Indonesian Government's exploitation of the province's gas and petroleum resources as well as the policy of transmigration which has seen many Javanese come to live and work in the province's coastal and industrial belts."
"The earlier cease-fire, which was aimed in part, from the EU's point of view, at ensuring Indonesian support for the worldwide fight against terrorism, whilst protecting the human rights of the Acehnese, is clearly now defunct."
"President Megawati understandably wishes to prevent Indonesia falling apart."
"The army appears to have persuaded her, unwisely, that a military solution is possible."
"It is highly unlikely that the military option is the only one that will work in the long term."
"A political solution now needs to be found quickly."
"Mr President, the Indonesian Government must formally put on record its opposition to human rights violations such as unlawful killings, including extra-judicial executions, disappearances and torture."
"It must make clear to the security forces that any violations will not be tolerated and that perpetrators will be brought to justice."
"Both sides have to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law - and be seen to adhere to them."
"There must also be a proper chain of command for security personnel."
"They must be made aware that they will be held criminally accountable for carrying out atrocities - not only the people who carry them out, but also those who give the orders."
"Crimes against women and children should not be tolerated under any circumstances."
"Unfortunately these continue at present."
"The Indonesian Government must take measures to protect the human rights defenders and members of the press who speak out about these atrocities."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0297/2003 by Mrs Marianne Eriksson, Mr Fausto Bertinotti, Mrs Yasmine Boudjenah and Mrs Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma;"
"B5-0303/2003 by Mr Walter Veltroni, Mrs Glenys Kinnock, Mr Margrietus J. van den Berg and Mr Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi (Burma);"
"B5-0305/2003 by Mr Geoffrey Van Orden, Mr Nirj Deva, Mr Thomas Mann, Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen and Mr Lennart Sacrédeus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Burma;"
"B5-0306/2003 by Mr Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Burma;"
"B5-0310/2003 by Mrs Patricia McKenna and Mrs Marie Anne Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Burma."
"Mr President, a never-ending drama seems to be unfolding in Burma."
"For years, a brutal junta has been terrorising the people of Burma, who live in extreme poverty."
"The regime bullies thousands of forced labourers, thousands of political detainees languish in the country's prisons, and the President, once democratically elected with an overwhelming majority, the holder of the Nobel Prize - and also the holder of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize - was imprisoned for years and then, after a short period in which the hope of a thin silver lining of democracy could be seen on the horizon, was arrested again on 31 May this year together with nine other members of the country's parliament."
"As you have no doubt learned from the media, it is not clear how many human lives the enforced military takeover has actually cost, or what fate the Deputy Chairman of the persecuted party, the National League for Democracy, has suffered."
"It is possible that the President herself was injured in this latest attack."
"This is a really serious reversal, given that exactly a year ago the release of Aung San Suu Kyi raised hopes that the regime was ready to carry out reforms."
"In this spirit of hope, a political dialogue was begun, under the supervision of the UN Special Envoy Razali Ismail, but it is to be feared that on his visit, planned for tomorrow, he will be prevented from meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, and that this will result in a further hardening of attitudes."
"Military might, political persecution and taking away the freedom of people who, in defiance of all repressive measures, continue to fight for democracy - all these must not be tolerated."
"The Council has therefore been invited to reintroduce, with immediate effect, the sanctions against the regime which had been temporarily suspended."
"However, it must also be clear that the Council, the Commission and in particular Parliament, in the interests of the people of Burma, do not want to close all doors in Burma."
"In other words, we are still ready to help to encourage a process of national reconciliation, but there must also be signs that such a reconciliation process is desired and pursued by all sides."
"As long as terror and military might prevail, however, no one can hope for tolerance from the European Parliament and from the other European institutions."
"Mr President, the arrest at the weekend of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy, is deplorable and shows that the military regime in Burma has no intention of democratic reform."
"Reports of personal injuries are all the more alarming."
"This turn of events also calls into question the effectiveness of EU action against the military dictatorship."
"We demand the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as the release of all political prisoners and the lifting of restrictions against the NLD, universities and other institutions."
"The very worrying deterioration in the political situation in the last few days is just the latest twist in a story of consistent human rights abuses."
"Anyone who expresses opposition to the regime is subject to harassment and arrest and goes in fear of their life."
"Ethnic minorities such as the Karin and the Shan continue to suffer violent oppression, and there are over 130 000 refugees in camps on the Thai-Burma border."
"Regrettably we witness yet another example where the efforts of the European Union and the wider international community to encourage change have brought few tangible results."
"Clearly we have not yet hit the regime where it hurts."
"The EU's extension of its travel ban against the regime, and assets freeze, were agreed in April but suspended until October in the hope of some improvement in the situation."
"The situation has clearly deteriorated, and the Council should take action immediately to implement the measures that it agreed in its common position."
"This situation could best be resolved if the Burmese regime were to respect the results of the 1990 elections, as the international community has consistently demanded."
"The Burmese generals are really doing everything they can to remain in power."
"Opponents are being silenced."
"The opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has spent half of the past 14 years under house arrest."
"She has now been arrested again, allegedly for her own safety."
"The junta is completely paranoid and controls the administration, justice, the economy and the private lives of the Burmese people."
"There is absolutely no democracy whatsoever, and the people are being kept ignorant."
"Anyone who has had an education is distrusted."
"Every time there is a student demonstration the government closes the university."
"The country has been in crisis for the past 14 years, and there is a shortage of everything except corruption, which is flourishing."
"The regime practices systematic discrimination against the Rohingya people."
"There is absolutely no sign of any rapprochement between the government and the opposition."
"In order to pull the wool over the eyes of the West, cosmetic steps are taken every now and again, such as the visit of the UN envoy Razali."
"Burma has one of the most corrupt regimes in the world."
"The international community has tolerated this for much too long."
"The more than 1 000 political prisoners must be released immediately, and all repressive measures must be rescinded."
"The European Union must make Burma an important point on the agenda of the ASEAN conference in Bali."
"As long as pressure from neighbouring countries remains minimal, the generals will be in no hurry to pack their bags."
"The European Union must also further intensify its sanctions policy."
"We must put a complete stop to business contact, which also means no investment."
"There is a risk that the resoluteness of the generals will result in a feeling that there is actually nothing we can do, but we owe it to the patient and extremely tenacious Aung San Suu Kyi and the poor population of Burma to do everything we can to drive the generals from power."
"Mr President, I agree with and support most of what has been said, but I wish to raise two points."
"The first concerns the whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"She has not been seen for many days, in fact since the end of May, when it was reported that up to 70 people were killed by the junta army and that she suffered a head injury."
"The fact that she has not been seen and that her whereabouts is unknown raises serious concerns about whether she is alive and what kind of condition she is in."
"This Parliament and the institutions have to send a very strong message to the Burmese authorities that international bodies must immediately have access to her."
"It is of crucial importance."
"We need to know immediately what kind of situation she is in."
"My second point concerns the resolution itself, which contained a call for new elections."
"I understand now that all the political groups have agreed to this being removed."
"I am glad, because it would send a very dangerous signal at this time."
"In other words, it would mean giving in to the logic of the generals, not accepting the decision of the people and basically undermining the National League for Democracy."
"I am glad that the parties who wanted this in have agreed to take it out, because it would be a really dangerous and very bad signal to send at this time to the military regime in Burma."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in Burma twenty leading opposition members have been arrested, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the holder of Parliament's Sakharov Prize, and the President of the League for Democracy."
"Over one hundred offices of the League have been closed down, its supporters have been persecuted and arrested, and according to our information just recently seventy sympathisers were killed in the North of the country by armed troops of the military junta."
"In the past few years, after the European Union had quite rightly suspended trade-facilitation measures and blocked foreign capital, the first positive effects were felt."
"In 2002 Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest, and there were justified hopes of reform, and so the EU decided to withdraw certain sanctions until the end of the year."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is asking that the Government of Burma should now release from arrest the Nobel Prize winner, her fellow-campaigners and the political prisoners."
"Persecution and murders must be brought to an immediate end."
"Universities, schools and the offices of the League for Democracy must finally be reopened."
"We are also asking for free elections under independent international observation."
"If the military junta continues to refuse to introduce a course of reforms which is so badly needed, then the visa ban must be extended and capital must remain frozen, without any possibility of licences being granted."
"The ASEAN States, the United Nations and the international community must be made to discharge their obligations, so that pressure from Europe receives wide support."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by saying that I fully support the calls made in the motion for a resolution."
"It must be beyond doubt that there is a need to tighten up the EU's sanctions against Burma."
"With the arrest of Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and 19 other members of her party, the military junta has of course again shown that it does not wish to improve conditions of democracy in the country."
"The junta's statement that Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for the sake of her own safety is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking person, and I entirely agree with Mrs McKenna that we must immediately demand to know where she is, and obtain access to her."
"It can therefore only be hoped that more stringent international sanctions will cause the military junta to mend its ideas."
"I think it important that the Council should intensify its demands in terms of human rights and continue to support the UN's special envoy."
"It should demand that all prisoners be released unconditionally and that a genuine dialogue with the opposition be resumed, for it is of course only through dialogue involving all the relevant political actors that a solid and legitimate democracy might be re-established."
"Mr President, the Commission agrees totally with what has been said here in Parliament."
"We are very concerned about the recent events, the harassment and the political violence experienced by Aung San Suu Kyi and the supporters of the National League for Democracy during their movements in northern Burma."
"The confirmation by the Burmese authorities that Aung San Suu Kyi and leading members of her party would be detained for their own protection is of great concern and the Commission fully supports all of the calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party leaders."
"The decisions by the Burmese Government to detain Aung San Suu Kyi and her collaborators, to close the offices of the National League for Democracy and to close the universities are significant steps backwards for the international reconciliation process and they must be suspended as soon as possible."
"It is now high time for the Burmese Government to show that it is committed to the national reconciliation process by working with Aung San Suu Kyi, the NLD and the other democratic forces in the country to restore democracy and to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"In this respect, and in light of the imminent visit to Burma of the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Razali Ismail, on 6 June, the Commission calls on the Burmese authorities to cooperate fully and constructively with Mr Razali and to allow him to meet freely with Aung San Suu Kyi and the other democratic leaders."
"As regards the application of the sanctions mentioned in the Union's common position on Burma of 28 April 2003, I can assure the Members of Parliament that the Commission is monitoring the situation very closely and is ready to support the implementation of these sanctions as soon as possible if the situation does not improve."
"Allow me to say, from a personal point of view, how much I respect and admire this great politician, Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of our Parliament's Sakharov prize, the Nobel Prize for Peace, and a torch of democracy and freedom."
"I truly hope that she is well and that with the help of all of the democratic forces she will be able to come through this for her own sake and that of her people."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on six motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe:"
"B5-0287/2003 by Mr Geoffrey Van Orden, Mr John Alexander Corrie, Mr Nirj Deva, Mrs Jacqueline Foster, Mr Neil Parish, Mr Charles Tannock, Mrs Mary Elizabeth Banotti, Mr Michael Gahler, Mrs Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola, Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen and Mr Lennart Sacrédeus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0299/2003 by Mr Luigi Vinci, Mr Joaquim Miranda and Mrs Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0300/2003 by Mr Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0304/2003 by Mrs Glenys Kinnock and Mr Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0308/2003 by Mr Bob van den Bos and Mr Jan Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0309/2003 by Mrs Nelly Maes, Mr Didier Rod, Mr Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye, Mrs Inger Schörling and Mrs Marie Anne Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, on numerous occasions the European Parliament has called for a widening of sanctions against the Mugabe regime and their rigorous enforcement."
"Yet there has been effectively no response from the Council."
"At the moment when the whole question of democratic accountability in the EU is under discussion, it is time the Council took more notice of European Parliament resolutions."
"The Council did renew, but in a weakened form, the sanctions against the regime."
"The travel ban against Mugabe and senior members of his regime has not been effectively enforced."
"Indeed, only last month the Trade and Industry Minister attended an EU meeting in the EU capital, Brussels, organised by the ACP, an institution created by the EU."
"We cannot even manage to enforce a travel ban in respect of our own institutions."
"In November last year it was left to the European Parliament to enforce the sanctions by denying the Zimbabwean representatives access to the European Parliament."
"That, of course, led to the postponement of that meeting, but we have to face this down."
"If African countries are willing to wreck the ACP for the sake of defending Mugabe, let them do it, but let us stop making exceptions all the time with respect to this travel ban."
"The situation is very much more serious at the moment."
"There are daily troubles in Zimbabwe, food and fuel are increasingly in short supply, inflation is running at 50% a month, and consumer prices will rise by 300% at least in the next few months."
"Zimbabweans are starving, 12.6 million are in need of food aid, and the strikes and demonstrations which have been taking place are evidence of the failure of the international community to act effectively against Mugabe."
"This resolution calls for us to renew our efforts."
"Mr President, intimidation, rape, land theft, murder, fraud, electoral fraud, deprivation of liberty, starvation: these are the instruments that Mugabe's reign of terror uses to throw the once prosperous Zimbabwe ever deeper into ruin in a staggering spiral of violence."
"Cries of distress from individual victims are still reaching us today from this humanitarian disaster."
"What are we to think, for example, of a secretary of the MDC, the opposition party, who was attacked in her house one night by one of Mugabe's teams of gangsters?"
"The accusation: being a prostitute of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai."
"The punishment: having the barrel of a gun inserted into her vagina, with death threats and other demands I do not wish to mention here."
"It is in this horrifying context that Tsvangirai called on the stricken population to stage a week of peaceful protest."
"The dictator, who will stop at nothing, attempted to suppress this cry for help with the now routine arrest of the opposition leader."
"Like the present resolution, I also find it incomprehensible and extremely unbelievable that the Council, circumventing the prohibition on travel which it imposed itself, is in consultation with this criminal regime in Brussels."
"This is an affront to the Zimbabwean people in need, as is the willingness of other African regimes to maintain contact with the regime."
"With the greatest possible emphasis I call on the Commission and the Council to reject this regime without compromise."
"In accordance with paragraph 5, I would also ask the Council to set an example to the international community and actually follow a general strategy of restoring democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Zimbabwe too the situation seems to be developing into a never-ending story."
"I myself was able to experience the escalation in violence when I visited the country on the occasion of the parliamentary elections as an election observer, albeit under the wrong label, because I was not recognised as representing the European Union."
"Over thirty opposition politicians lost their lives in these disputes, and we are now seeing a renewed escalation in violence."
"We must now face the fact that not only is Mr Mugabe using live weapons against peaceful demonstrators, but he is also using hunger as a weapon against his people."
"It has already been mentioned here today that over half of the population is dependent on food aid."
"We too, therefore, find ourselves in a quandary: if we do not want to let the people starve, we have to help them, but in so doing we are also unintentionally helping to keep Mugabe in power."
"Prices for essential goods are soaring in Zimbabwe."
"The rate of inflation is exploding, and is currently the highest in the world."
"The economy is in ruins; exports and tourism, once flourishing sources of income, have collapsed."
"The rule of law, once so dependable, has been set aside, and the most recent outrages have shown that the Council was right to agree to the sanctions against the Mugabe regime."
"However, those sanctions are not being consistently applied."
"This must be demanded as a matter of urgency!"
"If we expect these measures to make any impression on the regime, then they must also be consistently applied."
"We had this problem with an ACP meeting, which broke up as a result."
"We shall continue to come up against this problem, and if the Commission grants a travel permit for ACP talks or other meetings, then the regime will be strengthened still further, and our position, namely that we are in favour of the restoration of the rule of law and democracy and in favour of the protection of human rights, will be weakened."
"This in turn weakens our position within the ACP meetings too, where we are, after all, trying to get our African partner countries on our side, and that is certainly no easy task."
"We have experienced many disappointments."
"We have even experienced the situation in which we have not received support for our position in favour of the rule of law, for the protection of human rights and finally for a life fit for human beings in that country, complete with full democratic rights."
"I would like to emphasise, however, that, in a secret ballot, a good quarter of those present at the ACP meeting agreed with us, and some delegates even dared to say so openly, and to condemn, very forcefully, what is happening in Zimbabwe."
"However, we must remind all those who sit around the table with Mugabe in Africa that to support such a regime cannot be to follow the path of legality."
"We need to make our position absolutely clear here, and so, too, must the Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy with the tone set by Mrs Junker, and I would like to ask the British Conservatives to show a little more subtlety each time they put Zimbabwe on the agenda."
"We have done this often here, with precious little result."
"There has been no other country about which we have accepted so many resolutions with so little effect."
"Let us keep things in perspective."
"Zimbabwe is not the country with the largest number of victims of war or violence in Africa, but that does not detract from the fact that the situation is deteriorating dramatically."
"The economic situation in the country has never been so bad and is worsening every day."
"7.2 million of the 12.4 million people are starving, there are violations of human rights, and so on. Torture is the order of the day, and the arrest of journalists is making a mockery of freedom of the press."
"The people of Zimbabwe, however, have the will to bring about a peaceful transition."
"The MDC is exerting pressure through strikes and political actions, and we must support this pressure."
"We must support Mr Tsvangirai, who was the moral victor in the elections."
"If the elections had not been falsified, he would now most likely be the head of state."
"The opposition is exerting this pressure, but - and we noticed this during the ACP conferences - more and more African countries are willing to exert pressure."
"This has not always produced results, but it was important that Mr Mbeki of South Africa and the president of Nigeria both exerted pressure on 5 May, even if this does not seem to be producing immediate results."
"But who are we to think that everything can change in an instant."
"How does Europe handle this pressure?"
"Parliament is continually asking for all dialogue to be brought to an end."
"Is that the right method?"
"The Council is obviously pursuing a different method and wants to impose sanctions as long as these do not stand in the way of normal dialogue within the international organisations."
"We must know what we want once and for all."
"I call on Parliament to exercise pressure and to continue to do so and not to continually remain divided as to the way in which we do this."
"I support any healthy measure that will place the Mugabe government against the wall, but I also understand that the people of Zimbabwe, who have already suffered so much for the sake of democracy, also want to avoid a bloody war."
"We must know what we want, the Council must know what it wants and must not add a sentence about Zimbabwe in some back room somewhere, like in the G8."
"This will not help us at all."
"We share the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe, but we are also dreaming that democracy will ultimately prevail."
"Mr President, I wish to address the person who ought to have been in the public gallery today, namely Mr Mugabe."
"Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe freedom, democracy and the rule of law."
"Instead, you have given the people of Zimbabwe oppression, terror, ill-treatment, torture and killing."
"Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe a new future and a new equality, including equality of rights."
"It was emphatically not to create an inverted racism or to degrade and oppress people because of the colour of their skin, their political views or their party allegiances."
"Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe food and a future."
"It was not to give them hunger, famine, despair and death."
"Your task was, moreover, to become a part of Zimbabwe's history, of its bright and positive history."
"It was not to enter the history books as a notorious, cruel, narrow-minded and malicious dictator."
"Mr Mugabe, I have had the privilege of meeting many worthy campaigners for human rights and democracy in your splendid country, Zimbabwe."
"The violence committed against them by your troops and soldiers will not prevail."
"In a year's time, you will no longer be the leader of Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, I wonder how often we want to continue going through the Zimbabwe ritual here in the topical and urgent debate process."
"We have passed so many resolutions that we refer to them only en bloc, and hardly even bother to count them anymore."
"I could really just play back a recording of my last speech, because fundamentally nothing has changed there, unfortunately."
"If anything things have just become worse for the people in Zimbabwe."
"Even those who have written for our esteemed Commissioner the words that she is just about to say to us could probably, in the main, have substituted what they wrote last time, because the situation has not changed."
"The real political problem facing the EU is not so much what it does as what it does not do."
"I would like to say to the Council, which as usual is not present, that one can do wrong even by doing nothing."
"Must it come to a situation like the one in the Congo?"
"What Mrs Maes said was right: there are worse situations in Africa than the one in Zimbabwe."
"Do conditions have to become like those in the Congo?"
"How many deaths will it take before the Council at least stops making the Zimbabwe Minister for Industry and Trade welcome in the EU, or even takes effective action against Mugabe?"
"We are sending an intervention force to the Congo."
"Obviously the requisite number of people must have been killed there."
"In the case of Zimbabwe, however, we did not even refuse entry to a minister."
"I am very much in favour of our attempting, jointly, under French leadership, to restore peace in the Congo, but I would also like to say clearly that we cannot accept it when France, on the subject of Zimbabwe, has for years prevented or delayed effective measures or has actively blocked them."
"The Council must obviously face up to its responsibilities here and, if necessary, we must invite the relevant individual governments to come and explain themselves to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Motions for resolutions on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law:"
"Joint motion, tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE, PSE, ELDR, Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL and EDD Groups, on the situation in Indonesia, in particular in the provinces of Aceh and Papua (B5-0293/2003, B5-0298/2003, B5-0301/2003, B5-0302/2003, B5-0307/2003, B5-0311/2003)"
"(Before the vote)"
"Mr President, could you accept, by way of a verbal amendment, that I am left with only the most famous names among human rights activists."
"There are untold numbers of them, but the first two, Nazar and Kautsar, must stay."
"The others must go, because we do not want to name any more names."
"The human rights organisation we want to mention here is Amnesty International."
"We urge immediate acquittal instead of release."
"Mr President, according to the voting list at this point there was supposed to be an oral amendment presented by a member of the GUE/NGL Group who unfortunately is not here."
"I would like to take that oral amendment over, and it was signalled in the debate."
"It concerns paragraph 7, and it removes the words 'and that elections be held under international supervision without delay'."
"The text would then read: 'Demands that the SPDC relinquish its grip on power and that the results of these elections be fully respected'."
"Is anyone opposed to Mrs Lambert tabling this oral amendment?"
"Mr van den Bos has the floor."
"Mr President, it does not seem to me to be a good idea to stop elections from being held."
"That would naturally make a very odd impression."
"I understand the Greens' argument, though."
"The opposition parties are of course currently not yet ready for the elections and could be manipulated."
"My group would only be in favour of them if the words 'without delay' could be scrapped."
"We would then vote in favour of them."
"If matters proceed as formulated by the spokesman, we will vote against them."
"Mrs Lambert, are you in agreement with the arguments put forward by Mr van den Bos?"
"Mr President, the substance of our oral amendment would mean that what we were asking for effectively is that the results of the earlier elections stand and be implemented."
"'Without delay' changes the meaning of what we are attempting."
"We could not accept that, so I presume we will just have to vote."
"Mr President, I should like to ask that in future the votes should be held at the time indicated in the order of business, because then it would be possible for Members to be here."
"Mr Rübig, it was anticipated that we would proceed to the vote following the debates and that is what we have done."
"I should like to thank my colleagues, particularly Mrs Fourtou, Mr Oreja, Mr Manders and Mrs Echerer, for supporting this initiative for a written declaration."
"I want to thank all Members who signed it, even if at times they felt overwhelmed by our enthusiasm and over-zealous attempts at persuasion."
"It is clear that piracy has now reached epidemic proportions in Europe and poses severe risks to consumer health and safety, with fake toys, medicines and spare parts coming into the EU."
"In 2002 alone seizure of such goods doubled in the European Union."
"I believe that this declaration sends a strong signal from this House to Member States and to accession countries to act to crack down on piracy."
"Parliament has now called for action, with this majority support."
"The Italian presidency should now take up this issue and put it to the top of their agenda."
"We hope that Member States will not ignore or dismiss this House's wish for action."
"That was the last item on the agenda."
"The Minutes of this session will be submitted to Parliament for its approval at the beginning of the next part-session."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)"
"Mr President, this debate on Strasbourg is not scheduled."
"Can we move on to the explanation of votes please?"
"The deep grievances of Portuguese farmers against this profoundly unfair common agricultural policy are longstanding."
"It is always being said that Portugal and its agriculture benefit less than any other European Union Member State from the CAP."
"I voted for the amendments advocating the complete rejection of the European Commission's proposals because I wanted to register politically the fact that the Portuguese people were unhappy and disappointed with the Commission's original proposals. These did not even begin to constitute a satisfactory response to our legitimate expectations."
"Nevertheless, I do acknowledge the excellent work carried out by Mr Cunha, as well as the need for CAP reform. The latter is indispensable both for financial reasons - that is to say, reasons linked to negotiations with the World Trade Organisation - and because of consumers' demands and the need to respond to a new type of demand, oriented less towards production and more towards the rural world."
"I believe that the European Parliament's position has the merit of directing the reform towards more reasonable, balanced and fair positions, principally because of the gradualism and prudence it introduces."
"I would still like to give Commissioner Fischler the benefit of the doubt, as he guaranteed at the end of the debate that the Commission would now support Mediterranean produce as strongly as it has supported other production."
"For these reasons, I supported most of Parliament's proposals but abstained from the final vote."
"This resolution is a shameless confession of what the ?U means by 'cooperation' with the Balkan countries."
"At the same time, it reveals to the most disbelieving why Yugoslavia was bombed and what the purpose of breaking it up was."
"Within the framework of a clearly neo-colonialist policy, the European Parliament is calling on the Balkan countries to come into line with euro-unification and euro-Atlantic standards, to set integration into the EU as their sole prospect, to change their political structure and their internal legislation and to condemn their past."
"It is also calling on them to ensure they create a reliable system of prosecution, personal records and information, train their police in accordance with Europol standards, cooperate fully with the 'court' on Yugoslavia and reform their education systems in line with EU standards."
"These are the foundations on which the Greek Government and the ?U are building their policy in the Balkans: subjugation, abolition of any concept of national independence, in order to facilitate the penetration of the monopolies and the plundering of peoples and countries."
"In voting against this disgraceful text, we the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are emphasising that there is an increasingly urgent need to step up the peoples' fight against the imperialist expansionism of the ?U, against monopoly interests."
"A democratic Turkey is welcome in the EU - provided that conflicts with neighbours and minorities are solved."
"Turkey constitutes a test of principle for the EU."
"Is the EU to remain a closed-off Judaeo-Christian fortress with its claws out or to become a broad organisation of cooperation between all European peoples, nations, regions and linguistic and cultural groups?"
"For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the answer is clear: we hope that Turkey will continue on the path of reform so that formal negotiations concerning EU membership can be begun next year."
"I am in favour of Turkish membership provided that the country, for example, reduces the role of the army in political life and, if need be, completely abolishes the National Assembly; that the country's minorities - the Kurds, Armenians and Syrians - are given the same rights as other citizens; and that freedom of expression is guaranteed."
"The report also repeats an old desire from previous EP resolutions in 1987 and 2002 to the effect that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide that took place in Armenia in 1915."
"A reconciliation between Turks and Armenians must not fall through because of an historic argument of interpretation, but it is rather odd that contemporary Turkish politicians have such difficulty in acknowledging an historical fact without reservation - that, in desperation, the Fascist Young Turkish regime ordered the mass murder of Armenians, something for which the Young Turkish leaders were punished by Turkish courts after the war."
"In paragraph 4, the report calls upon the Convention 'to provide a legal basis for sport in the future Treaty of the Union, recognising its cultural, educational and social functions and including a reference to equal access for women and men to participation in sports and related responsibilities'."
"I am able to concur with everything that is being said in this House about sport - but not that the EU should be given the right to legislate in respect of this area too."
"That is why I have voted against the report."
"A Swedish proverb says that 'if you are too greedy, you easily lose the lot'."
"The EU neither can nor should take upon itself the right to legislate in respect of sport."
"That would be extending the EU's jurisdiction too far, and without the EU having the ability to comply with this responsibility."
"The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are unambiguous in indicating that centralised legislation at European level far away from the sports associations, clubs and practitioners would not add any value to sport but, on the contrary, afford it significant disadvantages."
". In the year 2000 around 216 000 women in the European Union fell victim to breast cancer and of these, 79 000 died."
"Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women aged between 35 and 55."
"We must reduce the breast cancer mortality rate in the European Union."
"Only eight out of fifteen Member States in the E.U. have nation-wide breast cancer screening programmes."
"Each E.U. Member State must guarantee that women aged between 50 and 70 receive a mammography every two years based on European guidelines."
"These programmes should be required to meet certain quality standards."
"Each mammograph must be read independently by two radiologists."
"The image quality and radiation doses of the equipment must be monitored regularly."
"I welcome the allocation of EUR 400 million for cancer research under the Sixth E.U. Framework Research Programme."
"Further research must take place into the relationship between breast cancer and potential risk factors such as tobacco use."
"I would urge the European Commission to bring forward a proposal for a recommendation on mammography and to do so at the earliest opportunity."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 June 2003."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would point out that, yesterday, 17 June, was the twentieth anniversary of the arrest of Enzo Tortora."
"I expect that this name will not mean much to many of the Members, but it will certainly have great significance for the Italians."
"He was a very famous television personality, elected as a Member of the European Parliament to the ranks of the Radicals of Mr Pannella."
"He was fully acquitted, after many years of legal proceedings: he was the victim of judicial error and media persecution, of an abuse of media power."
"This is something which, I regret to say, still happens today in many countries."
"I would just like to pay tribute here to his civil campaigns and to Mr Tortora himself, so that his memory is not lost in this House too."
"Mr President, I have asked to speak on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on a point of order in order to draw your attention to the situation of Vincent Reynaud, originally from Strasbourg in France, and Thierry Falise from Belgium."
"These two journalists and their interpreter have been secretly detained since 5 June in Vientiane in Laos."
"They have been accused by the Laotian police of cooperating with bandits in a professional capacity in relation to the murder of a Laotian security officer, while in actual fact they were preparing a report on a minority group living in the mountains."
"They are currently facing capital punishment."
"On behalf of my group, I call on you, Mr President, to take immediate action to ensure that the Laotian authorities free the journalists, Vincent Reynaud and Thierry Falise, and that justice and truth prevail as we are very much concerned and emotions are running high."
"I am happy to do that."
"Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament, I would like to ask you to speak to the Moroccan Government, and in particular the King of Morocco, to call for the release of a Moroccan journalist, Mr Lmrabet, who yesterday was sentenced to three years in prison, simply for having written articles criticising the situation in Morocco."
"Mr Lmrabet is on hunger strike; he therefore risks dying if there is no outside intervention."
"I would therefore ask the President - and we are ready to forward the file to him - to speak to the Moroccan Government in order to try to save this journalist's life."
"Please supply the relevant material and I will follow the matter up as you request."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take the floor to protest against the abuse levelled at the European Union by the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro during a rally a very short time ago. The terms he used in the course of his three-hour speech constitute accusations against the European Union - not only against the Commission, which has imposed a few token diplomatic sanctions, but also, by extension, against Parliament, which approved a vote of protest here."
"Fidel Castro's insults, his absurd accusations, show that the Cuban dictatorship is disintegrating and that the Cuban dictator has become no different from so many other Latin American dictators."
"Moreover, we must make no concessions to Fidel Castro."
"The wave of repression which has crashed down upon Cuba and swept writers, intellectuals and free men into prison must be energetically repelled by this House. The issue of human rights in Cuba is a pressing one."
"Furthermore, the myth of Fidel Castro and his aura must not deceive us: Mr Castro is now a dictator, and the situation in Cuba is unbearable for the world's democratic conscience."
"We must persevere in this struggle and not permit ourselves to be dismayed by the abuse at which he has become so adept."
"Colleagues, it is my sad duty today to mark the deaths of four German soldiers, part of the international security assistance force in Kabul, on 7 June 2003."
"These deaths occurred during a terrorist attack on the Kabul military airport where the soldiers were waiting for their flight home after several months of service in Afghanistan."
"29 of their comrades were seriously injured."
"These German soldiers are the first casualties by enemy action since Germany decided to take an active part in out-of-area military missions."
"I wish, on behalf of the European Parliament, to communicate our condolences for these victims and to their families, and to express our sympathy with the German Government and the armed forces."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"The next item is the extraordinary debate on the European Convention."
"Iñigo Méndez de Vigo and Klaus Hänsch, let me congratulate you and the 30 colleagues from this House, along with President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, his vice-presidents and the other members of the Convention for a truly remarkable achievement."
"You have produced a draft Constitutional Treaty which is clear, which is balanced, which is based on a single option and which could work."
"The ultimate vindication, if one was needed, of Parliament's total belief in the Convention method an open, inclusive, participatory and democratic preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The results of the Convention are also innovative."
"It was an operation which was originally conceived to address some of the business left over at Nice, and then broadened to answer a catalogue of questions from Laeken."
"The Convention has now produced a constitutional blueprint with a broad institutional balance."
"The proposal represents a radical improvement on our existing Treaties - way beyond what many may have expected."
"The first reactions, as I have followed them in this House, have broadly endorsed the result of the Convention."
"I am aware that nobody in an exercise like this can be 100% satisfied."
"But no politics anywhere can please all the people all the time."
"I am sure everybody can think of various improvements to different Articles, but to draw up a balanced project for tomorrow's Europe to which have contributed 28 national parliaments, 28 governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament and to get, at the end, a coherent result is something which should not be minimised."
"It should not be lightly discarded or unbundled."
"Those who would seek to unravel the broad consensus which has been created would bear a political responsibility and risk a result that would tend towards the lowest common denominator, precisely the result which the Convention wished to avoid - and it ably managed to do so."
"Some further work is required, and the Convention has expressed a wish to complete its work on parts 3 and 4 of the Constitutional Treaty in the first two weeks of July."
"I hope the Convention will be authorised to proceed in this way, in particular as regards the part 3 of the Treaty on the policies of the Union."
"We hope that the Convention will find the means to avoid gridlock on European Union decision-making, through excessive reliance on the veto mechanism."
"In this way it will achieve coherence with the rest of the text which responds to the double challenge of enhanced democracy and greater efficiency."
"The European Council is expected to convene an IGC later this year."
"I support the approach that the conference should be as short as possible and should conclude its work in good time for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections."
"I also strongly recommend that the Accession States should play a full and equal role in the IGC."
"I intend to ask the European Council in Thessaloniki to consider how best to associate the European Parliament with the working of the IGC."
"There is widespread recognition that in previous IGCs European Parliamentary participation played an important and constructive role."
"It is in the logic of the progress, the participation and the shared ownership that has emerged from this Convention that the role of the Parliament should be enhanced in the dispositions that would be made for the next IGC."
"Having the Treaty agreed well before the next European elections is essential."
"Our voters, the citizens, have the right to know what they are voting for, and what role the Parliament they elect is destined to play in the wider Europe of tomorrow."
"I also hope the new Treaty will contribute to making the next elections, along with the historic enlargement - although our sixth direct elections - our first real European elections."
"I conclude, as I began, by congratulating our colleagues who contributed so effectively to the deliberations of the Convention; by acknowledging, on behalf of the European Parliament, our debt of gratitude to all the conventionnels and to the leadership of President Giscard d'Estaing."
"A sound basis is now available to the governments."
"The Convention has given its lead. We call now on the governments to give theirs."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your words and I would like to congratulate you on having called this plenary session just a few days after the closing session of the Convention and just a few days before the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"This Parliament will be the first to debate the draft Constitution."
"And it is with emotion that I would like to point out that, in 1997, it was this Parliament, in a report for which Mr Dimitris Tsasos and myself were rapporteurs, that approved the replacement of the intergovernmental method with what we then called the Community method for the reform of the Treaties."
"That Community method, enshrined in the Resolution of 19 November 1997, is the Convention."
"The European Parliament's option has therefore been a successful one, because I would like to say quite seriously that, in the 16 months of the Convention's work, we have done more than in ten years of Intergovernmental Conferences."
"Firstly, Mr President, we have a Constitution."
"I remember how this Parliament was also a pioneer, through the report by Mr Olivier Duhamel, in calling for the constitutionalisation of the Union."
"This constitutionalisation is going to increase efficiency and is going to produce a Union of results."
"Many of our requests are in the text: the pillars disappear, the Union has a legal personality, we are going to reinforce the Community method, we have guaranteed the Commission's monopoly on initiative, a legislative procedure in which the Council and Parliament are on an equal footing will become the normal procedure."
"We have also achieved a move from unanimity to qualified majority in many areas, and this Parliament will be involved in 70 of them, when at the moment it is involved in 34."
"We also have a great simplification of methods, Mr President: we have ended up with five decision-making procedures and we have managed to use a language which was far-removed from the Community jargon."
"But we have also democratised the Union, starting with the first article of the Constitution, which speaks of the Union's double legitimacy, something which this Parliament has always advocated as a Union of states and citizens."
"When I entered this Parliament in 1992 it was a consultative assembly."
"After the Constitution this Parliament will be a Parliament worthy of its name."
"And this democratising effect also impacts on national parliaments."
"I would like to pay tribute to Mr Napolitano and his report, for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because we have created a means for involving national Parliaments in the Community procedure by means of the early warning system."
"I would also like to say to all of those people who have always noted a degree of rivalry between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament that our main allies in this Convention have been the national Parliaments. And I would like to pay tribute to them for that."
"I also believe, Mr President, that we have done something enormously important, something we have fought for in this Parliament, which is to integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution."
"We called for this before Nice and we did not achieve it, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now going to become the document which will give Europeans their identity."
"And not only have we reinforced the representative institutions, but also the participatory ones."
"The Constitution has recognised the role of non-governmental organisations and associations, and we have incorporated popular initiative as an instrument for semi-direct democracy."
"Mr President, when Mr Giscard d'Estaing was asked last week who had won, he said that in terms of this Constitution the European Parliament had won."
"I believe the citizen has won."
"I believe this is a triumph for the European citizens, who are going to have a Union capable of producing better results, a more transparent Union and, above all, a more efficient Union."
"And allow me to say that, as Chairman, I have been very honoured to carry out this task."
"Very honoured because the 32 members of the delegation - we have not distinguished between members and substitutes - have done exceptional work in defending the positions of Parliament and in providing technical and political support at all times for myself, for Klaus Hänsch and for Andrew Duff."
"Please let me say one more thing, Mr President: go to Thessaloniki."
"I believe that this Parliament's political message is a very clear one."
"You have said that this Constitution represents radical progress."
"I believe this is the most important advance the European Union has made since the Treaties of Rome, and I am therefore convinced that the Intergovernmental Conference is not going to improve it."
"I believe that we should defend this text, which has been presented without options, as the European Parliament wanted, to the end."
"At the end of this process, moreover, Mr President, I believe we must put it to a referendum."
"Certain governments, such as the Spanish Government, have asked that such a referendum take place on the same day as the European Parliament elections; and I believe this would represent the culmination of this democratising element contained in the European Constitution."
"Thank you very much to everybody for your help."
"Without your help, without everybody's help, this would have been impossible."
"Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the consensus on the draft Constitution which we reached in the Convention last Friday has been described as historic, and indeed it is - for look at what has been achieved."
"We have drafted a Constitution for over 25 sovereign states and peoples who, for centuries, were pitched head-to-head in plunder, war and devastation."
"That is without parallel in history."
"We have drafted a Constitution for a multitude of peoples and states who all have long histories of their own, who speak different languages, who maintain their own identity and yet who want to shape their destinies together."
"That is without precedent in the history of Europe and the world."
"What is new about it?"
"I would like to mention just six points which I think are especially important."
"Firstly, the Constitution sets forth the rights and duties of citizens."
"We have made the Charter of Fundamental Rights an integral and legally binding element of the European Constitution."
"Secondly, the famous 'four freedoms' of the Treaty of Rome were also promises for the future."
"Today, these promises have been fulfilled."
"The new Constitution contains a new pledge in Article 2 and Article 3, namely sustainable development, justice, security and solidarity for Europe's citizens."
"Thirdly, the most important contribution to democracy and to the 'ownership' of European policies is clarity."
"Citizens must be able to identify which areas can be regulated by the European Union and which cannot."
"They must also be able to identify who bears responsibility for political decisions and who does not."
"In this respect, the Constitution makes significant progress."
"We have created a division of competences which, for the first time, defines the competences between the Member States and the European Union more clearly than before, and I would remind the older Members of this House that Parliament has failed twice in the past to achieve this goal."
"We have greatly simplified and reduced the number of decision-making procedures."
"Fourthly, the European Parliament: codecision on matters of legislation will be the rule in future."
"Today it is the exception, but in future, it will be the rule, and that is a quantum leap compared with the current situation."
"After all, the President of the Commission will be elected by this Parliament."
"This enhances his political legitimacy and will increase the importance of the European elections."
"Fifthly, we have tackled the issue of institutional balance."
"We have strengthened all three institutions: the European Parliament, of course, but also the Commission, especially the Commission President, whose role is considerably enhanced, and we have also strengthened the Council, in the person of the President of the European Council."
"Sixthly, the European Union is not a global power, but it has a global power's responsibility."
"At present, it cannot do justice to this responsibility, but we have tried to ensure that it can do so in future."
"We have created the position of a European Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"However, we realise that simply creating this position certainly does not achieve commonality on foreign, security and defence policy issues."
"That cannot be regulated by a decision; it is a process, and the position of Foreign Minister will have to ensure that this process towards commonality is initiated and kept on track."
"Finally, I would like to point out that there were no models for what we have drafted."
"This constitution cannot be a copy of any nation-state's constitution."
"The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century."
"We had to reinvent ourselves in the Convention, not only in substantive terms: we also had to reinvent our working methods."
"We have not always achieved what we set out to achieve, but no Intergovernmental Conference since the Treaty of Rome has produced such significant changes, with such a far-reaching impact, as those now envisaged by the Constitution."
"With this Constitution, we can put the European Union, the 50-year-old organisation of European states, on a new footing."
"Treaties are based on mistrust born of past experience."
"Constitutions are based on confidence in the future, and with this Constitution, the citizens of Europe are linking their destinies to create a better future."
"Let us, here in the European Parliament, clear the way for this process and make sure that the governments face up to their European responsibility."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch."
"I would also like to say right away that our group can support the draft Constitution."
"Not all the dreams have come to fruition."
"If we consider the challenges facing us, especially the enlargement to twenty-five Member States, Europe's role in matters of war and peace, and worldwide developments, I would have liked to see something a little more courageous."
"I would have liked to see majority voting in foreign policy - but this is something which I hope we can still discuss during the negotiations on Part III."
"With twenty-five Member States, how can we make any progress on certain aspects of tax policy if we do not have majority voting, and if we fail to make further improvements here in Part III?"
"In other words, measured against the challenges, we cannot be satisfied, but what has been achieved is better than what we had before, and that is the essential point."
"It is better than what we have at present, for Europe has never been developed in a single step."
"Even with twenty-five countries, we still cannot enshrine 'finality', because no agreement can be reached on this."
"Walter Hallstein was right, as always, when he said that European union is a creatio continua - an ongoing process of creation."
"The progress which can be made at a specific moment in history is written down and enshrined in treaty form - and now in the form of a constitution - and is the basis for further development and progress within the European Union."
"This is the perspective from which we should view this outcome."
"I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch when they say that this is a truly magnificent achievement."
"If we look at our own nation-states and see how often it takes years of dispute to amend a tax law or perhaps revise a provision of the constitution, and how lengthy and difficult a process achieving a decision or an agreement can be, I think it is a miracle that so many nations, represented by their governments and parliamentarians, have been able to reach agreement on a common constitution."
"That is almost unprecedented in constitutional history."
"In all our countries, our constitutions were created as a result of new beginnings, crises, disasters and war, when there was social and political consensus in the country, but not in normal times."
"The fact that this has nonetheless been achieved has a great deal to do with the fact that the majority of this Convention was composed of parliamentarians, who - unlike the diplomats at the Intergovernmental Conferences - think in terms of solutions, not competences."
"For this reason, on behalf of my group, I would like to send one message to Thessaloniki."
"What the parliamentarians have drafted must not be reopened by the diplomats, for nothing legitimates their doing so."
"(Applause)"
"This is why we must defend what has been achieved, especially through the parliamentarians' work."
"Even if every one of us has an issue where he or she is not entirely satisfied, we must put it to one side and refrain, for the next six months, from making fresh demands."
"Instead, we must defend what has been achieved and postpone other desirable things for the time being."
"After that, we will have a chance of achieving them."
"I am also quite optimistic that every one of the governments that are now moaning wants a different thing changed."
"However, one would cancel out the other, and that is probably the safest guarantee that at the end of the day, the text will go through more or less as it stands."
"I believe that a Europe of citizens has also been created."
"What has been founded is a Europe of states and of citizens, safeguarded by fundamental rights."
"At the elections, the citizens will vote on the head of the executive because linkage has been established between the elections to the European Parliament and the election of the executive."
"We see that this has occurred on the basis of a value-oriented constitution."
"My group battled hard to include a reference to Christianity; we were not successful, but what has been achieved is a value-based constitution, with religious life being enshrined as an element of significance for the future, and values are, in any case, set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We have more scope for action."
"We have clarity between the institutions."
"We have found an equilibrium - despite the President of the European Council - which seems to me to be reasonably well-balanced."
"For this reason, we should vote for the draft Constitution and then have further discussions next week during the negotiations on Part III, if at all possible."
"In particular, we should ensure that we are more effective on the key foreign policy issue, but we should also remember that through closer cooperation, we have made much more progress than has been discussed in public so far, including the option of an obligation to provide support."
"I think that for this reason, it is good work and this House should endorse it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, almost 20 years after the European Parliament, elected by universal suffrage, produced a draft Constitution, the 'Spinelli draft', we are achieving a text for a Constitution for a European Union made up of 25 States and 480 million citizens."
"I believe we must welcome this historic success of the Convention, which has produced a democratic draft whose contents largely correspond to the hopes we had placed in this enterprise."
"I would first of all like to express my gratitude for the work done by the European Parliament's Delegation led very competently by the two Members who have represented it in the Presidium: Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch, who have acted as a coherent team fighting from the front but also protecting their rear."
"I believe that this has added coherence and seriousness to our representation and has helped our political families from throughout the enlarged Union to be able to work and mature in this House - which is the home of democracy in Europe - and to be able to create a common doctrine which has been specifically reflected in the text."
"Without making a very detailed analysis and assessment - this is a job we will have to do during the summer and which will have to be carried out by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - and in passing, Mr President, I would like to complain on behalf of my group because Mr Napolitano has not been given speaking time as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"He will speak within the speaking time allotted to the Socialist Group, but I do not believe that this is a correct way of proceeding."
"I would like to say on behalf of my group that we must celebrate the fact that we have a single text without options, without red cards; a text which opens doors and does not close them, and also one which is of a manageable size."
"I believe these are important elements on the basis of which we must work and make progress."
"We must defend what we have fought for tooth and nail and we must continue working; our two representatives have given a brief summary of what has been achieved."
"I would like to point out, in relation to the evolutionary clauses and the new date of 2009, that we must continue to work, drawing conclusions, creating doctrine and strengthening the European institutions."
"I would like to mention certain points which the Socialist Group sees as absolute priorities: to strengthen the social Europe and to defend Europe in terms of its economic governance, making progress in the field of taxation with regard to the internal market and majority decision-making in the field of foreign, security and defence policy; and we believe that this must also contribute to finding a better balance within the interinstitutional triangle."
"Our job must therefore now be to try to consolidate this Constitution as a basis for subsequent work, but we must work on the basis of what we have agreed, what has been achieved, which is an indication that we are able to act, and this is tremendously important at a time when the European Union was being portrayed as moribund and incapable of taking action."
"Furthermore, I believe we must welcome something which is also very positive, at a time when we have observers from the future member countries, and that is that they have participated fully in the work of the Convention before actually joining the Union."
"They are working shoulder to shoulder with us and playing a significant role, and this is being demonstrated in popular referendums."
"Over the last week we have had two significant successes in Poland and in the Czech Republic demonstrating that this is not just a market, but a shared project of coexistence, and we believe we should welcome it when so often distrust has been called for."
"Finally, Mr President, please allow me to comment on an important aspect, because we always talk about architecture and we must also talk about personalities, we must also support - and I would ask that this be done in Thessaloniki - the Council's Agreement returned this week on the Statute on European Political Parties. I believe that Parliament has done significant work."
"We must thank the rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen, for the great work he has done. It is clear that having protagonists who genuinely demonstrate that we are capable of organising ourselves is a fundamental element of European construction."
"And finally, Mr President, I would like to ask you on behalf of my group, when you go to the Thessaloniki Summit, to express the clear will of the whole House that the text which has been produced openly and democratically be respected, and also to say, on our behalf, that we want to be properly represented in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference; not just making use of previous experiences but with a representation which is in line with our participation and our dignity."
"Mr President, I too thank all those who have represented this House on the Convention."
"It is said that 'success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan'."
"The draft Constitution agreed by the Convention last Friday is blessed with many proud parents."
"Of these, the European Parliament can claim more than its fair share of paternity, since we led the calls for the Convention method to be used to avoid a repeat of the failures of Nice."
"We owe much to the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, which gave us the visionary Laeken Declaration."
"While the birth was difficult and the baby is not as pretty as we hoped, the European Constitution born on Friday 13 June 2003 deserves a long and fruitful life."
"Liberals everywhere will rejoice that fundamental rights now lie at the heart of the Union's basic law."
"We welcome the establishment of a single legal personality for the Union, the unification of the pillars and the extension of democratic control by the European Parliament."
"Crucially, this shorter and simpler treaty should also be more accessible to Europe's citizens since it sets out more clearly who does what."
"Of course we would have liked to go further in some respects."
"We hope that the post of Chairman of the European Council will in time be merged with that of Commission President in an integrated Presidency."
"We want to see the legitimacy of the Commission strengthened by a real election of its President by the European Parliament."
"We seek a greater role for regions with constitutional powers."
"And we would like greater recourse to majority voting, even in a sensitive area like foreign policy, so that the Union can act more decisively abroad."
"There is still work to be done."
"The extension of qualified majority voting needs to be given concrete expression in the policies in part 3 of the constitution."
"We also urge the Convention to be ambitious in creating a lighter procedure for amending part 3, through voting by super-qualified majority and without recourse to national ratification."
"At Thessaloniki, the Heads of State and Government will be granted custody of the new-born constitution and will bring it to maturity in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Having been so central to its conception, our governments will not be able to disown the constitution lightly."
"The European Council will have to decide the composition and the duration of the IGC."
"The parliamentary component of the Convention must be fairly represented at the talks - as you, Mr President, have said."
"Since members of the Liberal caucus under my colleague Andrew Duff have made such a great contribution to the work of the Convention, we insist that Parliament's representation should reflect this."
"On the length of the IGC, if Member States seek to unpick one part of the deal, others will pull at it too and the whole fabric risks unravelling."
"For that reason, we urge that the IGC be kept short and stick to the essentials of the text agreed by the Convention."
"This brings me to my final point."
"The most open and democratic institutional reform in our Union's history deserves to be brought to a fitting conclusion."
"It is no use making the EU simpler and more accountable if politicians do not then explain it and argue the case for active engagement in Europe"
"Speaking personally, I hope that my own government will at last shake off its reticence and take the case for Britain's membership of this refounded European Union to the people in a referendum."
"Whether they ratify by way of referendum or parliamentary debate, I hope that other countries too will seize the opportunity to have a great debate with their voters."
"That way, our people can again feel ownership of the European project."
"Mr President, 'not perfect, but unhoped-for': the words of Convention Chairman Valéry Giscard d'Estaing are entirely fitting."
"Despite some criticisms, which every Convention member could probably voice from their own standpoint, the result of the Convention's work is to be commended."
"What is significant, however, is that the Convention has presented the results of its work in a joint paper, which will be submitted to the summit without an alternative."
"The previous speakers, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch, have underlined the major progress achieved through the Convention's work, and I endorse their comments."
"From my perspective, we can indeed describe it as a milestone in the history of European integration, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank both of them particularly for their work in the delegation and their work in the Convention's Praesidium."
"What is especially important, to my mind, is that democracy in Europe has been significantly enhanced, not only the rights of the European Parliament or the national parliaments, but above all, direct democracy and citizens' participation in the development of the European Union."
"The fact that we will have a citizens' initiative as a mechanism in future and that people can get directly involved in European politics is something I see as extremely important, especially in terms of developing a European public arena."
"I fully endorse this."
"I am in favour of holding a referendum on the Constitution in every Member State."
"I would like to point out to everyone that an initiative has been launched for this very purpose with more than 100 supporters in the Convention and I myself am a signatory to it."
"I hope that in Part III, it will be possible to make further progress with European integration, especially in the social field and services of general interest, where we can link in with the work on Part I."
"Let me follow on from Mr Hänsch's comment a moment ago."
"He said that the European Union is not a global power, but that it does have a global power's responsibility."
"I must say that I am very alarmed by what the EU Foreign Ministers have just agreed in Luxembourg: for the first time, the European Union is threatening the use of military force against countries which flout disarmament commitments and are involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Naturally, this is not targeted at the USA, which simply withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2001!"
"It is not all that long since US Secretary of State Colin Powell painted a graphic picture to the Security Council of the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction."
"That was followed by the war, and as you all know, weapons of mass destruction have still not been found."
"I am frightened by the fact that the EU Foreign Ministers are now following the same line of argument as Powell and apparently want to endorse the Bush doctrine."
"Admittedly, the declaration does state, by way of restriction, that the UN Security Council will play what is described as a key role in measures threatened by the EU, but this does not allay my fears."
"The declaration conflicts not only with international law but also with the Convention's draft Constitution!"
"Article 3 (4) commits the European Union to strict observance of international law and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter."
"We all know that threatening the use of military force to resolve conflicts is prohibited under international law."
"We cannot allow the Constitution to be undermined even before it enters into force!"
"Mr President, the Convention came to an end last Friday with a glass of champagne for everybody, but, in actual fact, the work is not yet finished."
"The Convention still has to meet and debate."
"I hoped to hear today from our representatives what they intend to do in this Convention, and I urge them strongly not to sit back and think that it is all over now, that nothing can be changed and that, what is more, we have won."
"We still have to do as much as we can now, before the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Indeed, we know - as Mr Brok has said - that we will have to fight to avoid the governments, freed of the vociferous presence of the Members of Parliament and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, being let loose on a Constitution which is currently uninspiring, not least in that it fails to live up to the expectations of the majority of the citizens or, I believe, the majority of the members of the Convention."
"I do not agree with those who feel that the pseudo-Constitution we have today is the best we could have achieved, and I believe that it was a serious strategic error on the part of Mr Giscard-d'Estaing and the Praesidium to allow the Convention to be polluted from the outset by the intergovernmental method that it was trying to leave behind."
"Only during the final days of the Convention was it understood, at last, that submitting to the terms of the most sceptical governments could have caused the entire venture to fail, and the backing of national and European members of Parliament was sought, as well as the support of the much-maligned Commission, working together with the Presidents and the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Convention."
"Nevertheless, this measure was belated and ineffective, for it was not the fruit of months of work but improvised at the last minute."
"History is not made with 'ifs' and 'buts', but, given that it is not all over yet, we believe that these last few weeks must be used to further improve on the compromise reached, that we must learn from our errors and endeavour not to repeat them."
"For our part, we will endeavour to exert as much pressure as possible as regards four issues which we consider to be extremely important."
"Firstly, it is absolutely essential to remove the unanimity obligation for the revision of the Constitution and give the European Parliament power of ratification."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo, my friend and fellow Member, we are not and will not be a constituent Parliament because, as things stand, not only will we not have the power to ratify the Constitution but we will not be consulted on the convening of Intergovernmental Conferences either, as we are at the moment."
"Thus, we are in danger of losing powers in this area, not gaining them."
"Secondly, we must work hard to extend the role of the European Parliament in key sectors such as trade policy, cooperation in judicial and criminal matters and the drawing up of the Financial Perspective: the die is not yet irrevocably cast in this area."
"It is unthinkable that the European Union should continue to participate in major negotiations such as WTO negotiations without any supervision by the European and national parliaments."
"Thirdly, it is incomprehensible that, in the twenty-first century, after Chernobyl, after the majority of the current Members of the European Union have decided to stop using nuclear energy, there should be an explicit reference in the European Constitution to the promotion of nuclear energy."
"This is an error which could cost us dear in terms of public opinion, an error which we can still correct."
"Lastly, I do not believe that merely including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Part II of the Constitution has much significance for the citizens and legal residents of Europe without a corresponding, definite extension of the possibility of appeal to the Court of Justice, first and foremost in matters of judicial and criminal cooperation."
"This is our programme for the period between now and the last Convention meeting, scheduled for 10 July."
"We are searching for support both within and outside the Convention, in the hope that the Chairman, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, and his Praesidium will be able to guide it towards a result which is still within their reach today."
"When the Intergovernmental Conference opens, it may well be too late."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the draft Constitution completed by the Convention really was the excellent document whose echoes resound through the speeches of my fellow Members, and if it responded to a need genuinely felt by the peoples of Europe, the champagne drunk in this room a week ago would have been drunk in our countries too."
"The hymn which was sung here would also have been sung in our countries."
"That, however, was not the case."
"The celebrations spread no further than the walls of this building; in other words, the current is still not flowing. That is a serious problem which, by all appearances, the Convention has not solved."
"We want Europe to work better, but we do not think this is the way to go about it."
"Once again, the wrong method has been used, and we fear that this text may mark a return to the tensions and frustrations which prevailed in Amsterdam and Nice."
"We take issue with the desire to suppress all memory of the past, of history, of values intertwined with our roots. I am speaking specifically of the Christian topos inscribed and engraved all over our experience."
"We believe that the Convention served to clarify our options and their consequences."
"It did not, however, serve as a pretext for hasty decision-making - far from it!"
"Furthermore, a look at the Nice or Laeken agenda is instructive."
"Are the Treaties really going to be simplified?"
"Can a Treaty containing more than 400 articles and at least five protocols represent a genuine attempt at simplification, or might there have been a failure there?"
"What can one say, moreover, about the participation of the national parliaments, which have made few really significant advances in terms of their participation in European integration?"
"Laeken called for more democracy and transparency. Even the way the Convention works, however, is a bad example and a bad omen for the future: its functions are subordinate to the supreme whim of its President and to what I might dub consensocracy, a form of democracy without elections, where not a single vote has taken place."
"Laeken also asked the European Union to grow closer to its citizens."
"I am not sure this has happened."
"If the idea of doing away with the rotating presidency goes ahead, indeed, I am afraid that the Union will move much further away from its citizens."
"What do I expect from governments, then?"
"I expect them to take this responsibility to their citizens seriously as a basis for their work."
"I expect them to respect democracy and to listen, listen to their people."
"The people have a legitimate right to take decisions, since that right is bestowed on them democratically through the electoral process and legally through the Treaties."
"Mr President, constitutions belong to the people."
"They limit politicians' power between elections, referendums and constitutional changes."
"A constitution is the people's protection against the politicians."
"The draft EU constitution has instead become the politicians' protection against the people."
"Thirteen out of 25 prime ministers, elected on a quite different basis, are at the centre of power."
"Six or seven of the 13 will be people who can no longer be elected in their own countries and who can share the power among themselves after each election to the European Parliament."
"They must have an eye to the election result, but they themselves decide if they have had enough of an eye to it."
"In that way, Mr Blair can become President, Mr Fischer Foreign Minister and Mr Aznar President or Vice-President of the Commission."
"It is five years' consolation for all those who are finished in their own countries."
"EU leaders elect each other and are not accountable to the electorate."
"One of them must have a majority in the European Parliament, but Parliament cannot elect a second."
"If the Commission is elected, it can be overturned by a 2/3 majority, but Parliament still cannot elect a second one."
"It is an historic paradox that you have to be a democracy in order to enter the EU, but that the EU is not itself a democracy."
"If the European Convention were to apply for EU membership on the basis of the present draft constitution, we should have to say that there were very fine objectives and values in Articles 2 and 3, but why have you forgotten democracy?"
"Why does the electorate not have the final say?"
"Why must the constitution not be approved by referendum in all the countries?"
"Mr President, the Convention's conclusions, which are going to be discussed at the Thessaloniki Council, should have responded to one global question: how can we bring Europe closer to the citizens?"
"Yet it is difficult to see how the text proposed responds to the question in any way whatsoever."
"What is worse, it is clear to see that before long another treaty will be required to resolve the conflicts of power or clarify the obscure procedures the new text wishes to establish, for example in relation to the common foreign policy."
"However, above all, this text moves in completely the wrong direction."
"In order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, we need more real democracy."
"The Convention takes the approach of enhanced supranationality, in other words false democracy, by widely applying qualified majority voting and codecision, without any safety net for the national democracies as such, by establishing a European Constitution superior to the national Constitutions, and by transferring to the Union competences in the area of fundamental rights through the incorporation of the Charter."
"In these conclusions, I do not see anything that is going to bring Europe closer to its people, but I do see a great deal that is going to move it further away from them."
"In the wake of the new treaty, if it follows the Convention's proposals, we will be in exactly the same situation as before, and the democracy, the understanding, the affection of the people as regards the Union will not have progressed one little bit."
"If we want to re-establish contact between Europe and its people, and I will say this once more, we must get rid of the feelings of remoteness and powerlessness the people feel in relation to Brussels."
"There is only one way to achieve this: we must once more allow the national democracies to play an active role in European decision-making, for instance by giving them the right to control subsidiarity or by counterbalancing the Community mechanisms through a right of veto or non-participation that should be granted to each national parliament."
"Mr President, all of the timid proposals in this direction have been systematically reduced to nothing by the Convention."
"One day they will have to be introduced once more."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, but I feel I must also express some opinions and concerns as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The committee of which I am Chairman, and Parliament in general, were strongly in favour of the Convention and advocated the drawing up of a European Constitution."
"Work has begun on the Constitution."
"The Convention has succeeded in fulfilling its task, and this gives us great satisfaction."
"When we are called upon shortly to express our opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference, as the current Treaty lays down, we will assess the draft adopted by the Convention as well."
"We will be in an even better position to do so when we have seen the text - which needs further improvement, as Mr Brok and other Members have said - of Parts III and IV of the draft."
"As well as this deep satisfaction, we would like to express our appreciation of, and gratitude to, our representatives for their endeavours in the Convention and, in particular, in the Praesidium, to uphold the positions of the European Parliament."
"Of course, the draft adopted by consensus represents common ground between different positions: some of our representatives' proposals met with substantial resistance, echoes of which were heard in this Chamber just now."
"Our opinion must, therefore, be neither triumphalistic nor dogmatic, and it must not fail to express our concern, particularly on two points."
"Firstly, the risk of a change in the institutional balance of powers due to the creation of a new position at the top of the Union, the position of full-time President of the European Council."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs declared itself to be fully against this, proposing alternative or compromise solutions, but they were not accepted."
"Secondly, the possibility that the unanimity obligation would obstruct the decision-making process in key fields in a 25-Member State Union."
"We hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to go further: on this and other matters, we are determined to prevent regression in respect of the Convention's conclusions."
"We must, however, look closely at the unknowns which will affect the future of the Union."
"Maintaining a critical attitude and ongoing vigilance does not mean being destructive or pessimistic but serves to give fresh impetus to the process of integration and European unity."
"Altiero Spinello taught us that: without his criticism of the Single Act, the progress made at Maastricht and Amsterdam would not have been achieved."
"Mr President, you said in your opening remarks that the package that we have symbolises a radical improvement upon the present system."
"That is true, but it does more than that."
"Mr Straw and Mr Hain are profoundly wrong."
"It is a settlement that entrenches what is truly important, it discards what is not, and strengthens the capacity of the Union to act effectively abroad and inside the Member States."
"It ensures that the citizen will not be abused from the greater power that is to be exercised at the federal level."
"The European Council should accept the proposals, without qualification, as the basis for an agreement at the IGC."
"At Thessaloniki we should not see this pirouetting around a convoluted formula designed to deceive."
"Were the IGC to seek to open up the package, it is certain that the results will be inferior."
"What the 15 were unable to agree at Nice will certainly be impossible for 25 to agree at the future IGC."
"The leaders at Thessaloniki must listen to the voice of consensus as expressed through the Convention and through this Parliament, and build the future of Europe with courage."
"Mr President, it is being proposed that the European Union should have a constitution."
"The Convention has produced one: it approved the draft version based on a federalist consensus in a way reminiscent of a Politburo-style dictatorship."
"Once again it is a matter of a coup d'état on the part of the big countries."
"Qualified majority decisions take away small countries' right of veto, which, however, the three big countries still have when acting in concert."
"The Member States are to lose their permanent voting Commissioner, although the right of initiative with regard to all EU legislation will remain a Commission monopoly."
"The fact that there is to be a president and that foreign policy will not be in the hands of the Commission will make the EU a more decentralised federation than the federalist European Parliament's delegation would have liked."
"With the constitution the EU will be militarised and NATO has been written into it."
"When the other pillars were toppled a new NATO pillar was erected."
"The non-aligned countries must not sign the declaration regarding collective security guarantees to be annexed to the constitution."
"The collective defence of the EU in the constitution could also mean collective unlawful invasion."
"Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating not only our own representatives at the Convention but also the Convention as a whole for the tremendous work which it has carried out."
"However, this should be seen as one step in the process, not the end of the process, because we must move on to an Intergovernmental Conference , we must get the approval of the 25 governments and there will be changes within that process."
"One of the most important issues to come out of the Convention discussions has been the reiteration of the doctrine of conferral."
"In fact, for the first time, specific mention was made of that doctrine whereby the Union can only operate on the powers conferred upon it by the Member States."
"Those powers are clearly delineated between the institutions and the Parliament as a whole."
"Secondly, some Members have referred to this as the 'constitution' of Europe."
"A constitution by its very nature requires and needs the endorsement of the people."
"Therefore I join with other colleagues in appealing to all Member States not only to comply with their own constitutional obligations, but actually to put this forward to a referendum of the people within the Member States to give it the kind of endorsement and approval that it requires."
"Thirdly, the question regarding institutional balance is fair and maintains the equity and equality between the Member States."
"We should not forget that the European Union and its institutions were unique in building the foundations for a unique situation and we can continue that evolution of unique institutions for the future development of Europe."
"Mr President, the Convention will have been an enriching experience for those who participated in it."
"However, it will also have fully justified the judgment of a French philosopher who spoke of a Europe obsessed with its powers but indifferent to the results it achieves."
"There is no doubt that the draft Treaty, the so-called constitutional Treaty, that the Convention has produced in no way responds to the Laeken mandate."
"It does not respond to it as regards democracy since the Convention has organised a Europe that has no contact with the outside world, where various elements have slightly changed place."
"Parliament cannot actually complain about the progress made, but it is very far from what we call democracy, in other words the direct participation of the people in the decisions that affect them."
"I will not talk about foreign policy, where we have very clearly been sold a lemon given that 18 out of 25 European countries have no desire for a European policy as such in this field."
"I would reiterate what Mr Crowley said: if it is a Constitution, it must be put to a referendum, and if it is not put to a referendum by the people of Europe, it will not be a Constitution, because none of the citizens will feel committed to or protected by it."
"Mr President, I understand that you are going to Thessaloniki tomorrow or the day after."
"Perhaps our Parliament should vote on a resolution that would, I believe, bring together a broad range of all of the viewpoints represented here in order to send a strong message to the Council and to the countries that this text should be put to a referendum of the people of Europe when the time comes."
"Mr President, I believe that we all feel a certain satisfaction when we are part of an historic moment, whatever the context, and this is definitely an historic moment for, irrespective of different positions and disagreement, which we have heard expressed again today, I fully agree with what Mr Méndez de Vigo said."
"For the first time in history, we have succeeded in reconciling sovereignty with the protection of rights, leaving behind the concept of demos we have known and launching Europe towards future horizons whose limits will be for us alone to decide."
"Of course, there may well be a few minor flaws but, seeing as the preamble contained an extensive discourse with reference, not least, to Thucydides, I would like to draw the House's attention to the principle of the ancient Greek philosophers: history is never completely flawless because, if it were, it would not be perpetuated."
"I will not comment on the text of the Treaty but limit myself to one warning and one regret."
"One point on which we as Parliament must take care is the requirement of unanimity in decision-making."
"We have achieved a text which, without a doubt, launches the Community method and spirit towards new horizons and, given that the Constitutional Treaty with its many facets is a key card for us to play if we are to achieve greater European competitiveness, the requirement of unanimous decision-making in a 15-Member State Europe - as we have seen - has already, at many sensitive times and in many sensitive cases, created difficult, not to say impossible situations."
"Well then, opting to preserve unanimity in a 25-Member State Union may have very serious consequences, especially if the decisions hinge on economic or tax proposals."
"I fear that if we were to take the option of establishing a right of veto, which is still on the cards, we would ultimately be shooting ourselves in the foot, for this would ultimately reduce the European area - which is, in fact, the largest or one of the largest common markets in the world - to a mere collection of national interests."
"We must take care to avoid this."
"The regret is that I listened, with some surprise, to the debate held on the preamble to decide whether our religious, or rather Christian, heritage should be included among the factors making up our common identity."
"I would point out that the identity of Europe has been wrought from an experience of painful emancipation that has not, in our history, been free of tragic events, although they have, in any case, always led to liberation and growth."
"I feel that, from a spiritual point of view, this is one of the elements which contribute to the greatness of Christianity and make it a universal point of reference."
"I would like there to be further debate on this."
"Mr President, the Convention method as a method of implementing treaty changes is something quite new."
"Success has been achieved in the main aim of broadening the EU debate and bringing the negotiations out from behind the closed doors of dusty meeting rooms."
"We who had hoped, however, that the EU would fully move on from the stage of being a technocratic union and become a genuine democracy based upon a common European debate have reason to be somewhat disappointed."
"There are too many ground rules and too many exceptions to the norms."
"I nonetheless hope that this outcome will lead to a strengthening of the EU's competitiveness, something that is crucial."
"The next Convention must take up the loose threads that have been left dangling."
"Anyone who wants to see what this Convention really entails must read between the lines in analysing the outcome."
"Among the issues that will be on the table for the next Convention are foreign policy - a clear example of a loose thread - as well as merging the jobs of the two executive presidents into one and continuing to develop the Council into a second chamber."
"This constitutional treaty is really not the EU's last treaty change."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, devised at the time of the last treaty change, was not introduced then but has been incorporated now."
"That is the way the EU process operates."
"Exceptions to the normal decision-taking model in this Convention must be taken care of at the next Convention."
"The trend is nonetheless in the right direction, so the compromise must remain in place."
"Influence on the part of the people has, in spite of everything, been significantly strengthened."
"This may get to increase, but it may never ever decrease."
"The Communist Party of Greece is opposed to the introduction of a European constitution because it will strengthen the imperialist ?U at the expense of the peoples and for the benefit of the exploiters."
"In addition, the text of the Convention, which was set up and operated utterly anti-democratically by muzzling every voice on the left, does not crystallise the democratic rights won by the people."
"On the contrary, it diminishes them."
"The declaration of faith in an exceptionally competitive social (!) market economy also sets capitalism on a constitutional basis."
"The abolition of the revolving presidency, the composition of the Commission, the cutback in unanimous decision-making and the definition of the qualified majority show that this is about redistributing power for the benefit of the strong and handing over more national sovereignty to the imperialist, Euro-unifying centre."
"Militarisation is being dangerously deepened within the framework of the common defence policy which, of course, respects the obligations which derive from the North Atlantic Treaty."
"Terrorism is being used as a pretext for creating preconditions for new military interventions against the peoples of the whole world (without forgetting the 'enemy within') and a special role is being reserved for Member States with high military capabilities."
"It is no coincidence that the only minister is for foreign affairs."
"We are convinced that the peoples will not be deceived."
"Opposition to capitalism is growing, both inside and outside the ?U. The grass-roots fight will strengthen as the anti-grass roots policy intensifies and will pull down the edifice being so carefully erected."
"Every effort has been made to portray the Convention as a highly democratic body, on the point of preparing a Constitution which will replace the Treaty. The fact is, however, that this is not quite the case in terms either of the Convention's procedures or of its membership."
"The Convention did not include representatives of all political parties, only the larger ones."
"From the Assembly of the Republic (the Portuguese parliament), the Socialist Party (PS) and Social Democratic Party (PSD) participated in the Convention. The positions of these parties are identical to those which dominate Community policy, insofar as they defend federalism and neo-liberalism."
"Other political groupings, critical to a greater or lesser degree of such models and approaches, were excluded. That makes it clear what kind of democracy is being upheld here."
"It is true that the Convention has no constituent powers and cannot alter the Treaties, although that is what extreme federalists would like. The latter believe that a few dozen people, far from their countries and the problems and rights of their peoples, may be more easily swayed by the interests of economic and financial elites in the powerful countries which dream of ruling Europe."
"Only the Intergovernmental Conference and the national parliaments, however, will be able to alter the Treaties."
"It is true that the results of the Convention do not exactly coincide with its stated aim of paving the way for ever-deeper integration."
"The plan - albeit a dangerous one - is to take shorter strides."
"I should like to welcome as official visitors to the House today a delegation from the Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy of the Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by the Chairman of that committee, Dr Mohsen Mirdamadi."
"We welcome you as guests for our debates on the Middle East and EU security strategy."
"The next item is the statements by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission on the Middle East."
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure once again to be able to participate in this plenary session of the European Parliament to discuss issues which are essential to the European Union and to the World in general."
"I would like to join the President in warmly welcoming the representatives of the Iranian Parliament, headed by the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mirdamadi, with whom I had the opportunity to meet yesterday and have a wonderful conversation on topical issues, issues which we will have the opportunity to discuss this afternoon."
"I would like to begin with a few brief words on the situation in the Middle East, Mr President, which, despite the rays of hope we have seen over recent days, is still extremely difficult."
"We must be aware that every possible effort should be directed towards initiating the peace process, which is unfortunately not being implemented, although there have been moments of hope in recent hours and recent days."
"The Roadmap, which was produced by the Quartet, has finally been accepted by both sides, by Palestinians and by the Israeli Government."
"As you know, in recent days there have been certain very important meetings, one in Sharm El Sheik, in Egypt, and another important one in Aqaba, where three speeches, the speech by the President of the United States, the speech by Prime Minister Sharon and the speech by Prime Minister Abu Mazen, had the air of very important declarations."
"Unfortunately, that moment, which seemed as if it would lead to certain positive results, we have seen, if not die away, at least pass through a difficult phase as a result of the resurgence of violence in the occupied territories and in Palestine."
"As you know, immediately after the meeting in Aqaba, acts of violence took place, terrorist actions and responses to them, creating the unstoppable spiral which we have unfortunately been witnessing for so long."
"On the positive side, I would highlight the Quartet meeting on Friday of the envoys to the region, headed by Mr Moratinos representing the European Union, which has been positive and which will allow us to hold a new meeting on Sunday of the Quartet in Amman, which will be attended by its principal leaders."
"The aim of this meeting will be to consider how we can continue to promote the process which was opened up following the meetings in Sharm El Sheik and Aqaba, which led to the approval of the Roadmap by both sides."
"The Roadmap must be applied."
"If the international community is not able to do everything possible to see that the Roadmap is applied, we will be faced with the same failure that we faced when the Mitchell Plan was presented, or when the Tenet Plan was presented."
"Till now we have been able to produce sensible documents, documents which were full of hope, but which, unfortunately, the parties have not been able, with the help of the international community, to implement."
"The fulfilment of the Roadmap must be our objective and the international community must make every possible effort to achieve that."
"At the moment, as you know, two types of negotiation are underway, a negotiation which we could call 'intra-Palestinian' and another between Palestine and Israel."
"At the moment, it may be that we are once again seeing some light at the end of the tunnel."
"You are well aware of the intra-Palestinian negotiation."
"It is taking place between Prime Minister Abu Mazen and the factions which have rejected the Roadmap and which have not supported the statements made in Aqaba."
"There is a negotiation with the political leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the hope of reaching a ceasefire agreement soon, not a short ceasefire but rather one which really allows the more political aspects of the Roadmap to be implemented."
"Secondly, there is a negotiation between the Palestinian Authorities at the moment, headed by the Interior Minister, Mohamed Dahlan, and the Israeli authorities, with a view to achieving an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, or at least from part of it, and the leaders of the Palestinian Authority fully taking up their security responsibilities."
"If this were to be agreed, it would have consequences for all of us; we would also have to make an effort to help the Palestinian Authority, from an economic point of view, so that it could rapidly restore and construct at least a part of its security infrastructure."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe that the control of this process is absolutely fundamental to the application of the Roadmap."
"If there is nobody on the ground able to give their opinion, to analyse and to observe how this process is developing, I believe it will be very difficult to move forward and to achieve a good result."
"We are being offered an opportunity to bring this process to a successful conclusion, and you know that the objective would be defined by the existence of two states, two states which could live together in peace, and within a regional context, with which all the other countries of the region could establish diplomatic and other types of relationship."
"On Monday, in Luxembourg, the General Affairs Council met in the morning with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority, a friend of many of us, Nabil Shaat, and in the evening we received the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister."
"As the honourable Members will imagine, we are working in close cooperation with all the countries of the region in order to try to ensure that the opportunity offered by the Roadmap leads to a good result."
"A few days ago I had the opportunity to travel to all the countries of the region for the preparation of the Luxembourg Council, and I can tell you that there is a great desire for the application of the Roadmap to begin; and at the same time there is a great fear that, if this opportunity is missed, we may have missed the final opportunity to find a peaceful and lasting solution which puts an end to the frustration and suffering of so many people over so long."
"Therefore, to stop the violence, to stop the selective assassinations, are things which we must achieve amongst all of us so that we can implement the Roadmap."
"Please allow me to make a couple of comments while the President of the Iranian Foreign Affairs Committee is present."
"As I said, yesterday I was able to hold a good conversation with him, but I would also like to say that on Monday a statement was made in the External Relations Council, of which I hope all the honourable Members are aware, on relations between Iran and the European Union."
"I would like to say to our Iranian friends, who are here with us this afternoon, that the European Union sees Iran as a great country."
"It is a great country with which we want to have solid relations, with which we are involved in serious negotiations with two approaches, one of an economic nature and one of a political nature."
"It is the political aspect which affects me most directly. It has to do with human rights, with the renunciation of support for any form of terrorism and with the nuclearisation of the Republic of Iran."
"The honourable Members will be aware that the International Atomic Energy Agency, through its Director-General, Mr ElBaradei, whom many of us know, has been making certain clear statements on the behaviour of Iran and how it should behave in order to comply with the appeals and suggestions of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"As I said yesterday with all respect and affection to the President of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the European Union believes it is absolutely essential that our Iranian friends sign the additional protocol."
"There is absolutely no reason for them not to do so."
"Furthermore, our Iranian friends should not ask for anything in exchange, to sign the additional protocol is something which is in line with what countries such as Iran and the countries making up the European Union want: a world in which there is no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and a world in which energy is used for peaceful purposes in a manner which is controlled by the organs of the United Nations, and therefore, to sign, to comply with all the requirements of United Nations, seems to us to be absolutely fundamental."
"Our hope and desire is that the good sense of the Iranian authorities and people will mean that this demand, which we Europeans are making in good faith, becomes a reality as soon as possible. They must sign the additional protocol and they should do so without expecting anything in exchange other than to continue constructive and positive relations with their friends in the European Union."
"In this first speech I have been asked to give you some brief information about Operation Artemis, the operation currently being carried out by the European Union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the region of Ituri and more specifically in the city of Bunia."
"I would like to say that this is the first military operation the European Union has carried out without the assistance of any other organisation."
"It is the exclusive responsibility of the European Union. It is an autonomous operation requested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, who contacted me a few days ago to find out whether the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to an operation of this nature."
"The operation is not easy."
"It is complex, and therefore everything possible has been done so that it may fulfil its objective and so that the European Union may complete this commitment with its head held high and having implemented a resolution of the United Nations Security Council."
"I would like to point out that, immediately after responding to the Secretary-General that the European Union was prepared to carry out this task, the Security Council approved Resolution 1484 which defines the limits of this mission both in terms of space and in terms of time."
"But I would like to insist that in a genuinely record time, in less than two weeks from the first contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the European Union has been able to implement a whole complex operational set-up for the first military peace-keeping operation carried out by the European Union autonomously in Africa."
"I am glad to be able to say this, because many people in the Council, the Commission and the General Staff of the European Union have worked day and night producing high-quality documents which have allowed forces to be deployed in absolutely record time."
"And in relation to this thought, I would like to point out that we are midway through 2003. At the beginning of 2000, following the meeting of the European Council in Helsinki, we were asked to put ourselves in a position in 2003 or at the end of 2003 to be able to carry out peace-keeping operations of a military or civilian nature."
"I believe we can all be proud, Parliament, the Council, the Commission, all the citizens of Europe, of the fact that halfway through 2003, the European Union is currently committed to three peace-keeping operations: one in Bosnia, as you know, continuing operations begun by the United Nations, another in Skopje taking over an operation begun by the Atlantic Alliance and one currently in Ituri, an operation begun by the European Union which I hope can be completed by the European Union."
"All of us who have participated, therefore, can feel somewhat satisfied and proud: Parliament, the Commission, the Council, our colleagues in the General Staff, of having managed in such a short space of time to implement three operations which we must feel proud of, and I believe that Parliament must feel this and that we must also communicate it to the European citizens: the European Union is still working ceaselessly, with all the resources and capacities at its disposal, to try to make the world we are living in fairer and better and to ensure that the European Union plays a significant role in it."
"I would insist that Operation Artemis is going to be a difficult one."
"The honourable Members are aware that a few days ago we began to deploy the force. There are now 400 soldiers in the region."
"The operation is being led by a French commander, and France will act as the framework-nation for the operation."
"There are forces from many countries of the European Union, a significant proportion, but also from third countries, from Africa and from other areas of the world, such as Latin America, deployed as part of this operation led by the European Union."
"In accordance with the mandates issued to us by the Secretary-General of United Nations, we hope that this transition can be made when this force leaves the region of Ituri; a smooth transition to a fundamentally African administration and to this end we are in contact with the leaders of southern Africa."
"This operation in the Congo is not just a peace-keeping operation."
"We want to help to keep the peace so that we can accompany the operation with intensive diplomatic action."
"Since before the operation began and every day since it began on the 12th, I have maintained contact with the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the Presidents of the neighbouring republics, in particular Rwanda and Uganda, the countries which have been most closely involved with the region of Ituri in the north of the Congo."
"In a few days time I will travel to the region to try to give diplomatic impetus to the situation which has now been going on for a long time."
"As a result of this European Union cooperation we will perhaps be able to see the establishment of a provisional government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and we may glimpse signs of peace in these regions where, while there is unfortunately so much poverty, suffering and misery, there is also so much wealth underground."
"I would therefore like to thank, on behalf of all of us, the country which is heading this operation, France, and all the members participating in it including - as I have said - countries from outside the continent, and I would like to address very directly our friends in Canada, which has not had the least hesitation in involving its forces in an operation led by the Europeans."
"Canada has demonstrated once again its affection and respect for the European Union and, more importantly, the fact that it has such a similar view of the world's problems as the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end this first speech here."
"I believe I have left nothing out, but if I have, I am sure that everything will become clear when I reply to your questions."
". Mr President, the High Representative has just eloquently demonstrated how close hope and despair are in the Middle East."
"Following the presentation of the Roadmap and the Sharm-el-Sheikh and Aqaba Summits, there seemed to be a much better chance for peace . Alas, the ongoing violence is again putting this at serious risk."
"We, the European Union - and much more so the peoples in the Middle East - cannot afford to lose the opportunity for peace which has been created by the Roadmap, small though it may be."
"Now more than ever it is crucial that the Roadmap should be implemented without being taken hostage by extremists who do not want peace."
"Despite the violence of last week I hope that Palestinians and Israelis, with support from the international community, will generate sufficient confidence to allow them to move forward."
"We also need to reflect now on how we in the European Union could help on this."
"I can see several areas where the European Union and the Commission, in particular, could make a useful contribution:"
"First we ought to continue supporting Palestinian institution-building and reform, as we have already done with a successful record in the past."
"Secondly, we should contribute to the Roadmap's monitoring process and put pressure on Arab States to help dry up funds to extremist groups and to close the offices of those groups."
"We should also press Israel to moderate its responses to the unspeakably atrocious suicide bombings which many Arab leaders have themselves condemned."
"We will continue our concrete support to the reform process and will also assist the new Palestinian cabinet in achieving its ambitious goals."
"In 2003, the Community will provide a EUR 132 million support package for Palestinian institutional reform and respond to the deterioration of the economic and humanitarian situation."
"But clearly, the reform needs to go further in other areas as well: one that I have particularly pressed on Palestinian officials, even this week, is the judiciary."
"We would also like to see elections held by the end of the first phase of the Roadmap."
"The Commission has done a lot of work with the Palestinian authority, especially with the Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, which I am pleased to say has led to a successful reform process."
"This is by no means completed, and we therefore continue working closely with the Palestinian authority on reform conditions for our support during this year."
"Minister Fayyad has confirmed that with our latest help he has succeeded in consolidating public-sector revenues and there is much greater budgetary transparency with monthly budget execution reports available, even on the Internet."
"The reforms, together with external financial assistance, have allowed him to increase expenditure in Gaza and West Bank since the beginning of the year by meeting arrears and salary payments."
"Boosting aggregate demand was, in his view, the most important contribution that could be made at this stage to alleviating the severe constraints on the Palestinian economy."
"As a possible next step, easing restrictions on freedom of movement, including to Jordan and Egypt, would greatly help to revive economic activity."
"Further progress is needed."
"Next week, the European Union-Palestinian Joint Committee will be discussing all these issues."
"We will also explore ways and means of making better use of the Interim Association Agreement."
"As a member of the Quartet, the European Union will need to look at the monitoring mechanism."
"All Quartet partners should be able to contribute."
"The Commission is certainly ready to support this important work through our experience and activities in reform and institution-building, but also in the areas of economic and humanitarian issues."
"There is another area where we in the European Union will need to step up our efforts: the request of the Roadmap for all Arab states to cut off public and private funding for the groups engaged in violence and terror."
"We discussed this point at the Euro-Mediterranean meeting on Crete."
"We encouraged Arab states to channel aid funds through the single account of the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Finance."
"But we should use our partnership with Arab countries to address this extremely important point."
"There are, however, issues that need to be dealt with urgently in the context of the Roadmap and together with the United States: for example, the rapidly expanding settlement activities and the so-called security wall which is biting into the West Bank."
"Both undermine the envisaged two-State solution."
"Equally worrying is the worsening humanitarian situation which is compounded by restrictions on humanitarian access."
"These new measures have a negative impact on the operation of international donors and will make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to undertake humanitarian and development tasks."
"We welcome, however, confidence-building measures on the Israeli side such as the removal of so-called illegal settlement outposts, the lifting of curfews, the release of prisoners and the provision of more work permits for Palestinians."
"Additional proactive measures would help win the hearts and minds of the population and would reduce the attraction and influence of those who are so bitterly opposed to peace."
"As I said before, we are willing to help but it is up to the Israeli and Palestinian parties to take the first step."
"Without their political will and commitment nothing will change. The killing will go on."
"Let me just say a few additional words, following what the High Representative said about Iran and our relationship with Iran."
"I welcome, as you did Mr President, a delegation from the Parliament in Iran to the official gallery here today."
"I too have enjoyed discussions with them this week and, indeed, enjoyed discussions with them in Tehran."
"Over the last year and more, we have made it clear to our interlocutors in Iran that we want to develop a sophisticated, comprehensive relationship with them; which recognises that Iran is a great pre-Islamic civilisation; which recognises Iran's enormous geo-strategic importance in the region and, indeed, in the world; and which recognises that the outcome of the debate on democracy in Iran is important not just for the region but for all of us."
"It is a genuine debate and we watch it and listen to it with considerable interest."
"We have started, as the House knows, a series of discussions with Iran."
"We have three tracks of discussions: one on human rights, one on political issues such as the use, manufacture and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the third on trade and cooperation."
"We have had two rounds of talks on the first two of those issues, three rounds of talks on the first two, and four rounds of talks on trade and cooperation."
"The Council has always made it absolutely clear that progress on each of those tracks is interlinked, that we cannot make progress in one area without being able to demonstrate that we are making progress in others."
"We can point to some progress."
"We cannot, alas, point to as much progress as a result of the human rights dialogue as we would like, though we welcome, for instance, the agreement to allow thematic UN rapporteurs to return to Iran."
"There has been considerable progress on the trade and cooperation agenda where there have been very good and thorough discussions on both sides."
"I have to say that, on political issues, and in particular on the issue to which the High Representative drew attention - nuclear matters and the transparency surrounding Iran's nuclear programme - we have not enjoyed the progress that we would have like to have seen."
"This is not a new point for us."
"Every meeting I have had with any Iranian official - every meeting - has involved a call for Iran to sign the additional Protocol to the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"It was a point that the High Representative and I made when we went to Tehran in the immediate aftermath of 11 September."
"It was a point which, again, I made on a recent and extremely valuable visit to Tehran."
"So this is not an issue to which the European Union has come recently."
"It is not a question of us parroting other peoples' concerns."
"These are real concerns for us and we want to see them addressed."
"Iran is a sovereign nation and it makes its own decisions but I hope it will make decisions which will make it easier for it to get on with Europe, for it to get on with the rest of the world and for Europe to get on with Iran."
"That is what we would like to see but this has to be a two-way process of engagement."
"There has to be a recognition in Iran that when we talk about weapons of mass destruction we are deadly serious, not perhaps as deadly as the weapons, but certainly profoundly serious about what we want to see as the outcome."
"Mr President, the acceptance by the different parties of the Roadmap has followed a tremendous wave of violence in the region and unfortunately this is a relatively normal and well-known pattern."
"At times of hope there are always people whose extremism and radicalism lead them to commit acts aimed at undermining peace efforts."
"However, the international community is now closely involved: the United Nations, the European Union - we must not underestimate the role of the European Union - the United States and Russia."
"There is one fact which I believe to be irrefutable and that is that, since the beginning of the second Intifada, there have been more than 2 700 victims on the Palestinian side and almost 800 on the Israeli side."
"In other words, everybody loses here: the Israelis lose their security and the Palestinians lose the possibility of economic and political development, in other words the possibility of well-being for its people."
"The European Union is placing particular emphasis on increasing its diplomatic efforts, in order to ensure that - as Mr Solana has said - peace is based on the idea of two states, Israel and Palestine, living together in peace and security."
"I believe it appropriate to state here, when we are on the point of voting on an important resolution on transatlantic relations, that we should be pleased to note that the United States are prepared, together with us, to make an effort to move the Roadmap forward; and I believe that the comments of the President of that country, following the latest acts of violence and terrorism in the region, are a guarantee of this."
"It is time to move forward and to consolidate the achievements made, and to continue working on the basis of the application of the Roadmap."
"It is urgent that the verification mechanism be established and made operational as soon as possible."
"I believe that not only the United States but also the European Union and the United Nations have sufficient resources on the ground to begin this essential task and I believe that we Europeans must work with total pragmatism and realism in this area."
"We must therefore celebrate the fact that the peace process now includes the very active participation of the international community, which is now accepted by everyone to be indispensable."
"I believe that we Europeans are furthermore faced with two inescapable tasks: on the one hand, to give our full support to the Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, helping him to achieve the necessary trust of his people, of Israel and of the international community."
"And therefore, Mr President, I believe it is very important for Parliament's Bureau to invite him here so that he can give us his impressions and share his views with this House."
"The results of the meeting he held the day before yesterday with 13 organisations demonstrate the urgency of this task."
"We must help him to convince the Palestinian population that the government he leads, under the presidency - we must not forget - of President Arafat, is in an historic position."
"By the way, I would like to express my disapproval of the isolation which President Arafat is being subjected to, an isolation which I believe is of no use to anybody."
"The second job I believe falls to us, and this was noted by this Parliament's delegation for relations with Israel, is the need to make an effort to restore the confidence of an Israeli society which lives in constant fear of terrorist attack."
"On the issue of terrorism I believe this Parliament has been clear and firm, and we must continue to be so."
"No type of terrorist act is justified; we cannot distinguish either between terrorists or between their victims."
"I must not end, Mr President, without greeting and welcoming our colleagues from the Iranian Parliament and expressing my agreement with the words of the High Representative in relation to that country and, in particular, his request to the Iranian authorities."
"Iran is indeed a great country with which this Parliament - as we all hope and wish - must strengthen its friendly relations."
"Mr President, the publication of the Roadmap on 30 April offers a new opportunity to try to resolve a conflict which has led to seven wars in 50 years."
"If you will allow me, I believe we must distinguish between the Roadmap, which is an itinerary, and the journey itself."
"I would like to refer to a poem, which the High Representative will know well, by a great poet, Antonio Machado, who said that 'the path is made by walking'."
"The Roadmap may exist on paper, but what we have to do is to create the whole path with an objective which, for the first time, the whole Quartet, and not just certain countries, recognise."
"The international community believes that there must be a firm and definitive peace agreement based on the existence of two democratic and sovereign states, living together in peace within secure and recognised borders, and even accepting that, for the moment, a divorce may be better than living together."
"I would also like to point out that this is achieved by moving forward together and not by vetoing."
"And just as, in the previous debate, I criticised the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Sharon, did not receive the High Representative when he visited the Middle East, I also believe we must ask the next President?in-Office of the Council, the Italian Prime Minister, when he goes to the Middle East, not just to visit Israel, but also the Palestinian Authority."
"Our strength lies precisely in our ability to talk to everybody."
"I also believe we must stress elements which can help the Roadmap, the joint path, to move forward."
"For example, the Palestinian Authority has taken steps: the reform of the Finance Ministry, the creation of the post of Prime Minister and the support of the Legislative Council."
"We must not only talk about the Quartet, moreover, but also about those governments which, like Egypt, are making a very significant effort to contribute to the process moving forward, and above all to achieve, together with the Palestinian militia organisations, a break in hostilities; and I believe that the meeting of the Quartet in Amman on the 22 is an important step that we must support."
"It is clear that Hamas must leave behind the use of indiscriminate violence and that we must appeal to it and consider including it on the list of terrorist organisations unless things change."
"We must also ask the Israeli Government, which has the most strength in political, moral and military terms, to fulfil its part of the Roadmap, dismantling the illegal settlements in the occupied territories and putting an end to the policy of selective assassinations."
"With regard to the steps which must be taken, I believe we must encourage perseverance. We must also - and in this regard I would point out that Commissioner Günter Verheugen has just been in Israel - tell our Israeli friends that we are prepared to intensify our relations at all levels, as long as they also want to do so and are prepared to treat us as we deserve, particularly in view of the political will we have demonstrated."
"With regard to this process, all we can ask for is perseverance, to seek the possibility of helping these two peoples to move forward together, and an immense dose of patience."
"And in this regard, at a time when Ambassador Moratinos is on the point of finishing his mission, I believe it should be noted in the Minutes that this group thanks him, as does the whole of Parliament I hope, for the tireless work he has done over all these years."
"And I would like to end, Mr President, with two brief references to two issues which have also been dealt with by the High Representative and by the Commissioner."
"Firstly, our relations with Iran."
"I can only say that the Socialist Group supports intensifying these relations, opening up a new stage of significant relations in the economic and political fields with a young but at the same time very ancient country, with a dynamic and vibrant country, which also wants to open up its society, as is currently being demonstrated by what is happening with the students."
"We all have experience of the importance of student revolts and demonstrations; they are always an omen of what may happen within society, and I believe it is important to help Iran to find its way as a country."
"Therefore, as well as signing up to the additional protocol of the Atomic Energy Agency, I also believe that we can contribute to increasing stability in the region, because we must point out that this region needs stability."
"What it does not need are new points of conflict, because we are facing a multiplication of points of conflict from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean rim."
"What we have to do in this regard is to put fires out and not generate new ones, and the role of Iran may be very important."
"Finally, a very brief reference to Operation Artemis."
"We Europeans have historic responsibilities in Africa and the step taken by the European Union in the Congo is a positive one."
"Let us not forget that there are masses of conflicts."
"We have the case of Liberia, for example, which is also currently experiencing civil war."
"I believe that we in Parliament must dedicate all our resources to the European Union taking a step, which it has taken for the first time on its own, demonstrating that it has the capacity to re-establish normality in a continent to which it owes an enormous historical debt."
"Mr President, if Hamas can continue to obstruct the Roadmap with violence, there will never be any peace."
"The terror organisation rejects the two-State concept and wants to turn Israel into an Islamic state."
"The spiral of violence will never stop if Israel continues to be provoked by the attacks."
"The unlawful killing of leaders is, of course, an empty exercise if these are simply replaced."
"An international military force must be set up as soon as possible, preferably after a file agreement, but if the latter does not materialise, we will have to make do without one."
"Hamas should then be eliminated by an international military force, if possible in conjunction with NATO, so involving both European and Americans."
"At the same time, all Hamas's financial lines need to be severed."
"Israel and the Palestinians are thoroughly weary of the violence and misery."
"Finally, under international pressure, a solution is gradually manifesting itself."
"This is why the road must be blocked to anyone who is intent on more bloodbaths and no peace."
"Their Roadmap is one to hell."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the Roadmap is a hope to which we must cling without allowing our political judgment to be clouded or losing our clear vision of the incidents taking place daily in Palestine and Israel."
"There is no doubt that the European Union as a whole and the resolute, committed work of the special envoy, Mr Moratinos, have played a major part in drawing up the Roadmap and helping the Palestinian Authority to undertake the series of reforms laid down in the Roadmap, which - as we are quite aware - does not resolve all the issues but is certainly important."
"Egypt too has played an active role."
"It is essential, however, that the whole Quartet is involved and supports the talks."
"It would be too great a risk and, in any case, a mistake to leave management to the USA alone."
"At the same time, it is essential that we support the talks at all stages without recommitting the errors of the Oslo Agreement when, after the great handshakes, the two parties were left alone with very different power relations, with the result that violence and oppression prevailed instead of peace."
"We are all aware, I regret to say, of the complicity and subordination of some European leaders in the face of the dominance of the US administration and of the tendency shown by the Israeli Government not to value Europe, Russia and the UN as interlocutors, considering them - wrongly - to be biased towards the Palestinians: wrongly in that it is a question not of bias but of not renouncing the law and justice."
"In other words, the reality is that international law is not binding for some of these countries."
"In any case, if it were, if the law were being respected, the issue of Palestine and Israel would have been resolved a long time ago, at least when the PLO opted in 1988 at Algiers to coexist peacefully with the State of Israel and to have its own state in the territories occupied in 1977."
"The imbalance, symmetry and situation of Palestinians and Israelis, of occupied and occupiers, are not trivial considerations."
"Quite the opposite: it is essential to stress that it is the Israeli army which is occupying: it is not the Palestinian Authority which is building settlements and holding Palestinians prisoner."
"The utterly despicable terrorist acts against civilians are perpetrated by Palestinian extremists, not by an army duly equipped with weapons, although in saying this I am not absolving the Palestinian Authority of errors and weaknesses which have harmed the cause of a just peace."
"The Roadmap offering a possibility of peace for both peoples is, once again, a challenge and a source of hope, but if we genuinely want Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security, we do, of course, need to call upon the Palestinian Authority to make every endeavour to stop the terrorist acts - and Abu Mazen, with the support of President Arafat, is pursuing the path of dialogue with great determination to stop the violence and prevent a civil war - but we must also call very strongly upon Ariel Sharon to comply with the initial stages of the Roadmap and bring to an end the targeted assassinations which seem to be intended precisely to provoke terrorist reactions."
"Mr Sharon has said that three and a half million Palestinians cannot be ruled with military occupation."
"Then let him act upon his words, as Gedeon Levi, a Ha'aretz reporter says."
"Let him remove the checkpoints and stop the hunger and the demolition of houses, let the sick and nursing mothers have access to hospitals, let children no longer see their parents being beaten up or humiliated in the dead of night."
"This will lend impetus to the peace process."
"Then there is a monstrosity which Commissioner Patten mentioned too: the wall, the wall of separation, of apartheid, of annexing of territory."
"It is eight metres high and 364 kilometres long, protected by barbed wire and with electronic controls."
"The wall represents annexing of territory: 30 water wells seized, 16 Palestinian villages separated from cultivatable land."
"Ariel Sharon has given orders for construction work on the wall to carry on even during the night, and 374 kilometres are not enough for him - the banks of the Jordan are to be cut off by the wall too."
"We must exert pressure with the instruments we have to bring about the creation of two peoples and two states."
"We support Kofi Annan's call, backed by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, to send an international peacekeeping force to stop Palestinian and Israeli deaths."
"It is already long overdue."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr Patten, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago, I was in Israel for the first time with this Parliament's official delegation to discuss Europe-Israel relations."
"It was three years ago that a delegation had been there."
"Our visit to, for example, the Knesset was very informative, and the hope was expressed of maintaining better relations in future."
"Needless to say, the Roadmap was the topic of conversation."
"During our visit, there were also terrorist attacks in Jerusalem which we condemned unequivocally, but the Roadmap remained, and Prime Minister Sharon eventually expressed his support for this plan."
"Despite this, he continues to make matters worse by the army's campaign of slaughter in the occupied territories."
"Something basic is missing from the step-by-step plan."
"It is a process that requires external guidance, because mutual distrust is too entrenched."
"The proposal to set up an international peace force is therefore a much-needed addition to the step-by-step plan."
"The colour of the helmets is of lesser importance."
"The Union has a role to play here, for we have an historic responsibility in this region that is so close to the Union."
"The Union must claim a more prominent role in the Quartet, and I hope that this will happen under the Italian Presidency."
"Cooperation with the United States will be important for the further development of transatlantic relations."
"If the Union takes a united stand, we can play a key role."
"For historic and humanitarian reasons, we owe it to ourselves to bring peace to that region."
"Mr President, it is very hard to believe that since the historic meetings in Aqaba on 4 June 2003, 65 people have now been killed in what is a horrifying escalation of violence in the region."
"That violence includes a Palestinian suicide bomb attack on a bus in Jerusalem and a number of Israeli attacks on members of Hamas carried out in densely populated civilian areas."
"All right-minded people support the Roadmap for peace because this will ensure the creation of a future Palestinian State with territorial contiguity."
"The Roadmap also calls for the immediate dismantling of settlement outposts erected since March 2001."
"The Israeli authorities must seek to show restraint in response to these awful attacks and the Palestinian leaders too must press forward with their efforts to put an end to such atrocities."
"We must all ensure that we encourage Hamas to return to ceasefire talks with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmood Abbas."
"It is vitally important that the parties proceed with the implementation of the Roadmap elaborated by the international community, and that each side fully meets their obligations under this plan."
"Immediate implementation of the Roadmap is vital if one is to generate momentum for a peace settlement in the region."
"However, the brutal violence of the last fortnight, and indeed over the last 33 months of the intifada, has deepened animosities and intensified emotional hatreds."
"But we must seek to renew engagement between the Palestinians and the Israelis at all costs, and the European Union must play a central and pivotal role in this process."
"I appreciate the difficulties that remain regarding the issues of refugees and settlements but I do call on leaders from both sides to stand firm in their support of the Roadmap."
"If this process is to be a success, we must achieve progress along the political, economic and security tracks at all costs."
"Finally, in relation to comments made by Commissioner Patten and by the High Representative Mr Solana in relation to the visiting Iranian delegation, I too am very pleased that this delegation is here this week, and I am very glad about the comments that have been made here today by both Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten."
"As Commissioner Patten said, the agenda for the talks which are presently under way is a very serious European agenda and one that must be addressed before we can make progress."
"Mr President, Mr Barón Crespo was allowed an extra minute and forty seconds over and above the speaking time initially allotted to him."
"I hope that you will do the same with all of the speakers, including those like me - and I am not the only one - who found Mr Solana's contribution just now to be pathetic."
"As far as the regional orders known as the 'Roadmap' are concerned, although we are not surprised that it has been shattered into a thousand pieces in recent days, we still want to point out that the cause of this is very simple: for us, as supporters of sovereignty, we cannot conceive of peace without sovereignty and without the freedom of nations in balance."
"Without the balance of nations, there will be no peace."
"Yet the entire United States policy consists of accentuating the imbalances: the global imbalances, of course, as this superpower no longer recognises any boundaries, but also the regional imbalances, and that, in relation to this issue on the agenda, is undoubtedly the most serious aspect of all."
"Indeed, the entire United States policy consists of destroying all Arab powers when they emerge: it is very clear that that is the main reason behind its relentless attacks on Iraq, since it is a well-known fact that it does not want to see a modern and developed Arab power."
"Its policy also consists of supporting the extremists on both sides, both the Israeli and the Palestinian extremists, at times using Machiavellian practices that are sinister when one dares to look closely at them."
"Then, alongside that, there is this European policy - or at least there would be this European policy if Europe existed - that is actually the policy of France and consists of doing exactly the opposite, in other words supporting the moderates on both sides, both Israeli and Palestinian."
"As I have said, that is the policy of France and I hope that if some day Europe manages to have some kind of influence over the events in that poor world, it will realise that it is the wisest path to take."
"Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is an ideology - correct me if I am wrong - which unites us, or you, all: considering Camp David, Oslo and the Roadmap, what is our goal?"
"Creating, in a territory which is smaller than Normandy or Belgium, which says it all - I am talking in terms of square kilometres, of course, for I would not be so impolite as to make other allusions - two states: two independent states, mind you, not one US state and one Russian state."
"High Representative, the foreign, structural policy which we are pursuing there is exactly the opposite of the policy we have been committed to for 50 years with a view to the day - for pity's sake, it does not even occur to you because you are of sound mind, whereas I am a little nutty in the sense that I look forward to that day - when we can be citizens of the European Union without paying the price of being citizens of Italy, or France, or the United Kingdom."
"Certainly not, you are concerned solely with the states."
"We must resolve matters through states, by creating another Palestinian State."
"Never mind the fact that there could be another state, the State of Jordan, which is already a larger, stronger, more democratic Palestinian state than we could possibly imagine your Palestinian State to be."
"Your state, for pity's sake!"
"Then there is the problem of the Lebanon, but you are not concerned with anything beyond the fact that it is a state, never mind that it is a cover for Syria and everything which is most execrable in that region, in Mediterranean Switzerland."
"High Representative, Commissioner Patten, I know that the evil is present here too, first and foremost, in Parliament."
"We must fight alongside the antifascists and the anticommunists - with Altiero Spinelli, Ernesto Rossi and Robert Schuman, with those who conceived Europe not as a geographical entity but as the home of the law, of the Torah, of literature, of democracy - against national bureaucracies, inadequate as vessels of freedom, liberation and prosperity."
"Now you are trying to impose this famous Roadmap."
"I was in Jerusalem with our fellow Members and I said: 'The Roadmap?"
"A day, a week, a month?"
"Two Palestinian states?"
"All these Foreign Ministers, all these thieving, corrupt ministers?'"
"Yes, they are thieving and corrupt, as are many French, Italians, Germans, British and Americans; but there, corruption has another dimension: it is corruption of the body, of freedom, of the law."
"We must not set them off along that road. We must not encourage it."
"Would the High Commissioner kindly spend a brief moment telling us about our European army, which has, at last, been sent to the Congo?"
"At last!"
"And under whose control have we placed it?"
"Focard's heirs!"
"I repeat: Focard's heirs!"
"We are entrusting peacekeeping in that area to those whose attempts at decolonisation have resulted in foul massacres which are worse than those of the colonial period."
"I wish you luck, Mr President."
"I wish you luck, fellow Members."
"High Representative, Commissioner, I wish you luck."
"We need it."
"I look forward to the time when I, the Israelis and the Palestinians will have the right to citizenship which is not your or our prisons."
"We want to be free in the law and in freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Rhinelander, I lack Mr Pannella's capacity for emphasis, but I would like to make a number of comments, just as strongly felt, on the speeches by the High Representative and Commissioner Patten."
"The Roadmap is essentially a method which the European Union applies all over the world."
"It is how we have shaped our enlargement process: by setting a goal and then providing support - both financial and political - for the stages along this road to enlargement."
"I regret that in the past, this well-established European principle sometimes seemed to be forgotten or appeared suspect, for there was an impression that no matter how much terrorism there was, no matter how much intifada or violence occurred, we Europeans act as if nothing had happened and carry on paying and maintaining contacts with President Arafat."
"It is a good thing that we have moved away from this."
"It is a good thing that Commissioner Patten has transformed budget aid into project aid again, that he is now involved in the reform of the Palestinian Authority, that we have very close contacts to the Palestinian Finance Minister, that we say a resounding 'yes' to Prime Minister Abbas and give him our support, and that we meet rather less often and less vocally, perhaps, with Mr Arafat."
"We do not need to isolate him, but we must make it clear where Europe's sympathies lie."
"We may have been a little late in doing so."
"Secondly, we are now making tougher demands of ourselves, and we should be making these same demands of the neighbouring countries as well."
"Now that Iraq no longer has Saddam Hussein as a dictator and is hopefully on the way to more democratic structures, we must send a clear message to Syria and Iran."
"The message is this: if you want to conduct relations with the European Union, you must say 'yes' to the Roadmap and participate in the process as well."
"We have made this very clear to our Iranian colleagues over the last few days."
"Maintaining good relations with the European Union while supporting Hizbollah is not an option."
"Maintaining a close friendship with the European Union while funding, supporting and cultivating links with the offices of terrorist organisations is not an option."
"I am therefore grateful to Commissioner Patten and the High Representative for stating this so categorically here today in plenary."
"If Iran is willing - even in this very difficult situation, also in its relations with the United States - to improve its relations with the European Union, then it would say 'yes' to the Roadmap and 'yes' to a Palestinian state by 2005, but it would also say 'yes' to Israel's right to exist, for even now, this statement is not forthcoming from most of the Arab states who would like to be the European Union's partners."
"If we were to receive such clear signals, this would strengthen the Middle East peace process as well."
"That is the message to us in the European Parliament: despite all the setbacks, despite all the violence, we will make more demands, not only on ourselves but also on Israel's and Palestine's neighbours, and that includes both sides."
"It also includes Prime Minister Sharon."
"He must be told very clearly that there is no room for negotiation on the Roadmap."
"That is the basis, and that is what we regard as the framework for the Middle East."
"The settlements must be removed."
"Here too, there are clear demands on everyone involved in this process."
"In my view, this clarity has been missing to some extent from Europe's policies over the last two or three years."
"We now have the chance to come back into the frame with the United States, Russia and the United Nations."
"I believe this will give fresh impetus to the peace process."
"Mr President, the timing of this discussion is quite important, given the fact that today's world our generation is living through the greatest revolution in history - telecommunications, technology and transport - as a result of which the world is a much smaller place."
"For that very reason, influential countries like the United States, or many other countries, or indeed the European Union, are in a stronger position to shape that world because it is a smaller place."
"For that reason it should be the primary objective of the new century that we use that influence to ensure that there will no longer be any wars or conflict."
"This means that in practice we send our philosophy of peace and reconciliation to areas of conflict."
"Of course, the best example of conflict resolution in the history of the world is the European Union: that is something that is hardly ever mentioned, and I often think is sometimes forgotten."
"The first half of the century we just left was the worst in the history of the world: two World Wars, 50 million human beings slaughtered."
"Who could have forecast that those same peoples, at the end of that century, would have come together in the European Union?"
"Therefore, the principles at the heart of the European Union, are principles that should be sent to every area of conflict - I know because the three principles of the European Union are the three principles that produced peace on my own streets in Northern Ireland: respect for difference, no victory and the creation of appropriate institutions."
"Then, through those institutions, we can work together in our common interests and break down the barriers of the past."
"I would like to see that philosophy of the European Union sent to all areas of conflict in the world, and for that reason the European Union should have a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation backed up by a substantial directorate, that could, instead of sending soldiers to areas of conflict, send a team that would promote dialogue."
"The first message to the Middle East would of course be to get them to agree in advance that it is people that are divided there, not territory, because without territory even the Middle East is only a jungle, and when people are divided, they should agree that they can never solve their problems by any form of violence."
"They can only do it by agreement and by sitting down to reach that agreement."
"I believe there is a major opportunity now for the European Union to lead by example, to give leadership to the world and create a world of lasting peace."
"Mr President, it was 4 June in Aqaba. Ariel Sharon and Mahmoud Abbas were talking about peace, making pledges and embarking on the road marked out by the Quartet, a difficult road, without doubt, but one without any alternative."
"Remarkable things were said."
"The Palestinian Prime Minister referred to Palestinian terrorism, not political activism but the terrorism and suffering of the Jewish people."
"The Israeli leader, for his part, confronting some of his cabinet, expressed his clear desire that two peaceful States should coexist side by side in order to end the suffering of the Palestinian people."
"Europe and the United States must now use all their weight to ensure that this fragile window of opportunity, which opened slightly two weeks ago, does not close again on cruelly dashed hopes."
"There have already been 50 deaths since this summit, affecting both sides, the most recent victim a seven-year-old girl killed yesterday evening by the violence of men."
"Noam was Israeli, but that is not what is important here."
"When a child dies, a part of each of us is extinguished."
"So here, in such a short space of time, we have to say that Europe must make every effort to support the actions of these two men and to prevent the extremists on both sides from continuing to set fire to peace, so as to ensure that Aqaba does not become another Taba."
"Mr President, there will not be the slightest beginnings of a peace process for the Palestinian and Israeli people until the political conditions for a just peace have been met."
"The first of these conditions is the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from the occupied territories."
"However, neither Sharon nor Bush want that."
"The first steps to implement the Roadmap are, it must be recognised, pathetic."
"What is the dismantling of some caravans parked completely illegally compared with the aspiration of a people, with their legitimate right to a State?"
"The continued construction of a security wall, the continued atrocities, the continued policy of targeted assassinations say a great deal about Sharon's desire to persevere with his fatal logic."
"This heightens the despair of the entire Palestinian people, but their determination to live in freedom within their own State remains intact and we must support this."
"Indeed, the European Union cannot remain deaf to what is at stake in the Middle East today."
"It has the political resources to act."
"It is the final chance for the Council to decide at last to back the opinion of the European Parliament advocating a suspension of the association agreement with Israel until its forces withdraw from the occupied territories."
"It is time for the UN to at last oblige the Israeli Government to apply the resolutions it has adopted."
"Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to touch upon three subjects in one and a half minutes - this will therefore be an extremely brief intervention."
"In connection with Israel and the Palestinians, may I ask you to check whether the efforts are being requested from both sides?"
"I have noticed that the Palestinians have been put under extreme pressure."
"I wonder whether pressure has also been brought to bear on Israel to start leaving the settlements, for that could defuse the situation and could be a clear signal that could take the wind out of the sails of the terrorists."
"The Union must also exert actual pressure via the Association Agreement."
"Mr Patten mentioned that better use should be made of the Association Agreement."
"Does he mean that both the human rights provisions in that Agreement and the origin rules in this accord will be examined?"
"After all, these rules stop privileges from being granted to products that are being exported from the areas of the settlements of Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank."
"The peace process is still fragile."
"It is being ripped to shreds before it has even started."
"I therefore think that more should be done than is currently the case in order to make actual progress."
"As far as Iran is concerned, following so many debates this week, I should like to ask for it to be ensured that trade and political interests do not take priority over human rights."
"You mentioned the protocol."
"I should like to add the human rights aspect, for I do not want women and men from Iran who fight for freedom to be violently oppressed, while we have polite conversations that fall on deaf ears."
"Finally, Mr High Representative, a word about Ituri."
"It is something but is, I fear, too little."
"It is also too late, but I support your efforts nevertheless."
"On behalf of the 50 000 people already killed, I should like to ask you to try to do more."
"Your current efforts are not enough to protect Ituri as a whole against the violence, and only that can save the peace process in Congo."
"I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner and the High Representative for their presence here in this Chamber and for their reports."
"To start with, I would like to make a few comments on what I have heard, briefly for I do not have much speaking time."
"Firstly, as regards our European policy, I do not believe that the essential, initial priority for those with a political message is the rebuilding of the PNA."
"It is important, but it cannot be taken as a basic starting point, or we would be showing bias."
"We need to combine it with other points."
"The Commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority."
"Secondly, I do not believe - and I am addressing Mr Barón Crespo here - that it should be we who are seeking out the Israelis but, seeing as we are the ones who want to become interlocutors, it has to be we who approach them."
"Thirdly, I do not believe - and I am addressing Mrs Morgantini here - that it is for us to define rights, when we can see that the law is being ridden roughshod over by people throwing bombs and killing seven-year old children on the other side."
"What I believe we can do as the European Union - and it is important at this time, especially now when Abu Mazen and Ariel Sharon are continuing to talk, although both sides are acting and reacting - is to legitimise the role of Abu Mazen: in this difficult situation, the more legitimacy we give him, the more successful we will be in creating the conditions for relative peace."
"Moreover, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the presence of the Iranian delegation to call upon Iran, precisely because of its long history and its role in the Middle East, to recognise the State of Israel: let it do so, if necessary, through the European Union, but let it recognise the State of Israel."
"This is important and essential, not least in terms of the recognition of human rights and of economic and, therefore, political development too within Iran."
"I am sure that this would help to pave the way for a genuine, lasting peace process in the Middle East."
"Mr President, the violent destruction of the State of Israel."
"That is what the Palestinian Islamic terrorist movement, Hamas, has in mind."
"Peace efforts in the Middle East must concentrate on neutralising enemies of peace, such as Hamas."
"The Council decisions taken the day before yesterday in Luxembourg constitute a step, albeit a very late step, in the right direction."
"The European Union would now like to act against the entire Hamas movement, and no longer confine itself to the so-called military wing of Hamas."
"I truly hope that the Member States will be united in adopting a consistent policy against another enemy of peace in the region, the Lebanese Hezbollah, for that 'Party of Allah' does not want to resign itself to the existence of a Jewish state either."
"In its meeting in Luxembourg, the Council was right to underline the need for a constructive stance in the fight against terror by the States in the Middle East themselves."
"The Islamic Republic of Iran, of all states, with which the European Union is in intense negotiation at present about a deepening of the economic and political relationship, is refusing to cooperate."
"Mr President, how else am I to interpret the statement which Iranian ex-President Rafsanjani made last Friday?"
"With an obvious reference to the suicide bombers, this authoritative Persian politician stated: 'For each Palestinian who goes to Heaven, 300 Israelis go to Hell'."
"The European Union must continue to take a forceful and consistent stand against this religious legitimisation and encouragement of terror, for the sake of its own political credibility, both inside and outside the Union and, above all, for the sake of peace in the Middle East."
"Mr President, scarcely had the United States taken the important step forward of recognising, through President Bush, the undeniable need for Palestinians to have a viable State and for Americans to play an active role in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, using all of their might to ensure that the Roadmap is implemented, than the unstoppable chain of attacks and ripostes began again, compromising the re-launch of the negotiating process that was outlined in Aqaba."
"We must deplore the increasing influence in this respect of the most extreme Palestinian movements, and in particular Hamas."
"Their contention of the legitimacy of the Israeli State is totally unacceptable."
"However, should we not begin to ask ourselves whether the increase in the number of attacks aimed at dividing the Palestinians and the refusal to accept once and for all that they deserve an independent State worthy of its name are perhaps the two main factors that are bolstering Hamas today and at the same time weakening the Palestinian Authority as a whole?"
"The financial hunt and the targeted assassinations are certainly not the most effective methods of reducing the extremists' success."
"The most effective methods are the political methods."
"When the Palestinians are offered a credible prospect of a genuine State which, although small, will be a sovereign State and have the necessary territorial continuity for a fully functioning State rather than a pseudo-State or the appearance of a State, that is when the Hamas star will pale once and for all."
"There is also one method that we should not ignore or refuse to consider, and that could play an important role in facilitating the separation of the two parties and the resumption of dialogue: the power of interposition."
"We are well aware that eventually, at the appropriate time of course, the presence on the ground of an outside force of this kind will prove to be essential."
"Indeed, from a European point of view, this means doing more than remaining a spectator or a commentator at this stage; this is where we could make a useful contribution to the search for peace."
"I understand, Mr High Representative, that you do not approve of this idea initiated by France, but also taken up by the United Nations Secretary-General and others."
"If that is indeed the case, I am very sorry because I believe that it is an original and useful idea, which we should instead try to share with our partners if we truly want to make our contribution in a way other than by declaiming the resumption of the peace process."
"Mr President, a few weeks ago we saw the publication of the long-awaited US Roadmap to peace in the Middle East, a document fully supported by the rest of the international community, including the Quartet of the US, the EU, Russia and the UN."
"No-one should underestimate the significance of this initiative, at a time when despite the terrible violence on both sides, a rare opportunity for moving forward has now finally presented itself."
"There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs of the desirability of a negotiated solution, whilst Prime Minister Sharon himself has talked of the damage to Israel's economy and society caused by the continuing violence, and the impossibility of permanent occupation and Israeli rule over four million Palestinians."
"Only the extremists, it seems, are afraid of peace."
"Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict, there is increasing recognition amongst Arabs that Israel is here to stay, whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel's long-term security is best served via recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own State by 2005."
"President Bush was understandably reluctant earlier in his presidency to become involved in the minutiae of negotiations which led nowhere and he wisely stood back."
"He has now taken the right step at the right time to show his personal commitment to a lasting peace."
"For the first time in many years a solution seems to be in sight."
"That opportunity must not be wasted."
"The Roadmap is specific on a number of points, not least an immediate cessation of violence on both sides, an initial freezing of settlements and their eventual dismantling, and a willingness on the part of the Palestinian Authority to face up to its historical responsibilities, and rein in the men of violence."
"Israel, for its part, now that it has accepted the Roadmap, must give Prime Minister Abbas the chance to show his commitment to the peace process."
"If the Palestinian authorities arrest those who continue to attack Israeli civilians, there will be no need for helicopter gunships to attack Palestinian civilian areas."
"Nothing would be worse than for this process to be held up because of reprisal killings by the Israeli Government if the Palestinian authority is genuinely committed to peace now."
"Israel's agreement today to end the track-and-kill operations of senior political figures from Islamist groups is to be welcomed."
"I also welcome the timely decision taken on Monday by the EU Foreign Ministers to issue an ultimatum to Hamas to implement the Roadmap of face serious financial consequences."
"Already their military wing is a classified terrorist organisation and their despicable and tragic policy of recruiting suicide bombers must be repeatedly and universally condemned by all."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased that Hamas is now starting new truce talks with Prime Minister Abbas."
"I agree with Commissioner Patten that the future Palestinian State must be territorially contiguous and viable and not peppered by Israeli settlements, whilst clearly the right of return needs delicate handling."
"Perhaps a generous financial package of compensation to those who lost property might be the final answer."
"Imaginative thinking is also needed for the final status of East Jerusalem."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten personally for his total and transparent collaboration with the working group on scrutiny of EU funds to the Palestinian authority which is now up and running and will reach its conclusion by next year."
"It is worth noting that, unlike Iraq, the Quartet is an example of how a common European foreign and security policy based on unanimity can actually work."
"Iraq, by contrast, has shown us that a single, majority voting policy, much less one that could be communitarised, is wholly unrealistic and will result in division and animosity by all parties."
"In the meantime there is much work for the EU to do to convince both sides of the Arab-Israeli problem that peace is the only real option available in the long term."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for the report on the Middle East, I decided some months ago to focus on what is known as the 'Roadmap'."
"I felt it would be absurd to do otherwise when the Roadmap is currently the Union's guiding principle and when the Palestinian Authority - although I do not know how many Palestinians - support this document and the process it sets out."
"In all honesty, I am not convinced at the moment that Ariel Sharon has any great enthusiasm, either for the process or for the document."
"I say this for the following reason: when the Prime Minister presented the Roadmap to his government, he described it as a 'necessary evil' and secured his cabinet's vote by stating that the 14 reservations or amendments presented to Washington - not to the 'Quartet' - are non-negotiable."
"The Prime Minister made no mention of having to remove settlements, which is crucial if a viable Palestinian State is to be achieved."
"Furthermore, Prime Minister Sharon declared on 27 May in the Knesset that the settlements would not be discussed in the context of the Roadmap, but bilaterally between Jerusalem and Washington."
"Israeli television also stated on 10 June that Washington had accepted Israel's request for matters to proceed in this way."
"In light of these details, I wish to ask the High Representative whether he believes that this information and specifically this bilateral agreement on settlements between Jerusalem and Washington, if confirmed, might constitute a breach of the Roadmap."
"I should also like to ask the High Representative whether, in his opinion, Israel's 14 reservations or amendments, if accepted, could destroy all prospects for the process and for peace itself."
"Mr President, in our view, the Roadmap represents, at all events, a chance of peace which must be pursued over and above any feelings of like or dislike."
"It calls, first and foremost, for an end to the conflict, to terrorism, to suicide attacks, to targeted assassinations; it calls for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories so that two peoples can coexist in peace within secure borders, with the guarantee of democratic institutions."
"To this end, we believe that the role of the international community is essential to the Roadmap, but we also believe that the European Union must forge itself a stronger, more incisive role in Middle East politics, not in order to set itself up against the United States but precisely so as to stop continually burying its head in the sand and to establish a foreign policy."
"Basically, that is the challenge facing the Convention, although it is not yet clear how best to tackle it: the challenge of building a political Europe which is able to address at global, at world-wide level the major issues of today - democracy, peace, freedom and development for all peoples, irrespective of race, colour or creed."
"Mr President, with only one minute to speak I will focus on the Roadmap and how to keep it on the road."
"The answer can be boiled down to one sentence: the respect for the rule of international humanitarian law."
"Any struggle to make Palestinians respect humanitarian law, including those who engage in the criminal act of suicide bombing, will be futile if the State of Israel - the primary party responsible for respecting this rule - repeatedly violates it."
"It is illegal to build settlements on the occupied territories and demolish houses. It is against humanitarian law to make targeted assassinations accompanied by the killing of innocent civilians, to mention but a few."
"I therefore urge the Quartet to make it crystal clear that international humanitarian laws must be respected by all parties."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how many peace plans has the Middle East already witnessed? How many were not worth the paper they were written on?"
"It is futile to answer this question."
"It is only now that conditions are in place which, despite everything, do have a prospect of success."
"This is undoubtedly due to the European Union's efforts and the Roadmap which it produced together with its Quartet partners, the USA, Russia and the United Nations."
"Of course, there have been plans before, including the Mitchell plan."
"A Roadmap and a good timetable certainly do not guarantee that we will actually get to where we want to be."
"There have to be the right actors on both sides, and of course there also has to be pressure from the United States on Israel."
"While the European Union is important because it also has credibility among the Palestinians - too much, sometimes, for the Israelis - I do feel optimistic, after the meeting between Abu Mazen, Mr Sharon and President Bush, that the new peace initiative can be kept separate from the deadly cycle of violence and reprisals."
"This is partly to do with the overall political environment in the Middle East."
"With the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime - whatever you may think of the US intervention - one obstacle has fallen away; the system has been removed, cutting the ground from under the radical Palestinian movements and those who are in favour of extremism."
"Iran too, which has always provided the backing for Hizbollah, should play a constructive role here and think about whether it wants to continue supporting this organisation as it has done until now."
"There is currently an opportunity to isolate the radical forces and give the moderates a chance."
"This approach can only work if the European Union and the United States complement each other and do not pursue different strategies."
"While the situation in Iraq is tragic and unsatisfactory, there is also a possibility, for the first time, that Syria and therefore perhaps Lebanon as well will join a peace process with Israel."
"However, that means that Israel must make sacrifices too."
"Prime Minister Sharon must not bow to pressure from radical settlers and movements, as this would ensure that Israel could only develop within its biblical borders."
"The EU must encourage and back him in this as well."
"Most of the Israeli population is willing to make some sacrifices in order to live in peace and security. However, this also means, of course, that the Palestinian side must abandon its strident demand for refugee return on a one-to-one basis, which would spell the end for the State of Israel."
"Should the European Union be involved with its own peacekeeping troops?"
"This option requires serious thought."
"I myself find it difficult to foresee any real benefit, firstly because Israel has never entrusted any military force but its own with its security, and secondly because the force could become the target for suicide attacks without being able to prevent them."
"Ultimately, everything stands or falls by President Bush's determination to help the Palestinians live in their own state."
"He must show this determination even in an election year."
"The only way to prevent the Roadmap from trickling into the desert sands is for the European Union and the USA to work together and adopt a unified approach."
"If they appear to be competitors in the Middle East, this will create a window of opportunity for fresh extremism."
"Mr President, in a history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the leader writer of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonot writes that 'no public document before the negotiations has ever been applied'."
"In fact, publication kills implementation."
"In accordance with this macabre logic, the Quartet's Roadmap has already been killed on two occasions."
"The first time was by the proclamation of the 14 reservations, accepted by Washington, of Sharon's Government."
"This deprives the various stages of the Roadmap of any substance."
"But the worst thing is that Sharon wishes to remove all references to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which form the legal basis of any peaceful resolution in the Middle East."
"If the law is annoying, we should therefore begin by doing away with it."
"With the war in Iraq, hegemonic power has set an example."
"The second torpedo launched against the implementation of the new peace plan is the shameless return of lex talionis: attacks followed straight away by poorly targeted assassinations."
"The downward spiral of violence is turning faster and faster."
"There is thus no opportunity to return to the absolute calm required to get the process up and running."
"Faced with this regrettable development, the only sensible proposal comes from the United Nations Secretary-General."
"He recommends sending a force to operate between the two parties."
"This proposal was immediately rejected by Sharon's Government as Israel does not have any borders, and as long as Israel does not accept its own borders, there will be absolutely no chance of any peace plan starting or succeeding."
"Given this impasse, a simple and clear solution is required, a solution that would instantly put an end to the terrorism: Israel must implement Resolutions 242 and 338, withdraw from the occupied territories and withdraw its troops back to within its internationally recognised borders."
"The application of international law is a guarantee of immediate success for the Roadmap."
"The UN, the United States and the European Union have the resources to do this, but they lack the political will and the courage."
"Mr President, I have three observations to make."
"We were horrified by the events of 11 September."
"The suicide attacks to which the Palestinian terrorists are subjecting the Israelis are a daily 11 September, and beginning to evacuate the settlements changes nothing at the moment unfortunately."
"My second comment relates to the Roadmap."
"We must not be mistaken as regards its nature."
"It is a framework and is not designed to be a straitjacket."
"It opens negotiations and is not designed to close them."
"It is a programme and is not designed to be a diktat."
"Thirdly, in the negotiations that are now beginning, Europe's position is weak because it is unbalanced and appears to be biased."
"Italian diplomacy has begun to work towards restoring the balance."
"We must wish it every success in ensuring that the Italian Presidency finally enables Europe to play a useful role in establishing peace."
"Mr President, in the last few weeks, we have switched between hope and despair almost on a daily, even hourly basis."
"Nonetheless, we - and by that I mean Europe and the USA - must remain faithful to the implementation of the Roadmap."
"It is as much an American plan as a European one."
"Indeed, we pressed hard - and I thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for this - for the publication and then for the implementation of this Roadmap."
"Now, as some speakers have already said, there is a chance of achieving peace only if we both adopt a joint approach."
"I do not take the view that Europe is acting unilaterally if it puts appropriate pressure on both sides - on Israel and the Palestinians."
"We need a viable and secure state both for Israel and for Palestine."
"That needs to be recognised."
"We do not want violence from the other side - and Mr Nordmann, if I recall the debate in committee, what else is the settlement activity, which is illegal under international law, but violence?"
"The construction of the wall is appalling violence, profoundly affecting people's living conditions and even their lives."
"Of course, the same applies to the horrifying acts of terrorism, for which I have no sympathies whatsoever."
"We made it clear to the Iranians with whom we spoke yesterday in particular that any form of sympathy with, or indeed, acceptance of terrorism cannot be tolerated by Europe."
"Above all, however, terrorism is one thing: it is self-destructive."
"Any society based on terrorism already bears the taint of violence within itself."
"What we certainly need is support for Palestine's security."
"The Palestinian Authority will be unable to resolve the security problem on its own."
"What we also need - and even if the Israelis are opposed to this, we must exert constant pressure to achieve it - are international troops as observers, but also with the option of intervening."
"We also need Abu Mazen to be successful."
"The Commissioner takes the view that we need elections, and I think he is right, but elections can only take place usefully once Abu Mazen has had a chance to prove that his course is better and more successful for the Palestinians than the terrorism perpetrated by Hamas and other movements."
"Over the last few days, a young Israeli doctor came to visit me."
"She spent two years in the military and now she is providing medical care in a mobile clinic in the Palestinian territories."
"Day after day, this young Israeli goes into the Palestinian territories and helps to ensure that the Palestinians have a modicum of basic healthcare."
"As long as such people exist in Israel and on the Palestinian side, we must do everything we can to press for peace in the Middle East with hope and confidence."
"Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, it would appear that to the many enemies of peace that we know must be added improvisation and presumption, which, when employed by people in leading institutional positions, can have devastating effects."
"I am referring to the recent visit to Israel by the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and to the fact that, in ten day's time, Mr Berlusconi will take on the post of President-in-Office of the Council here in Brussels."
"I would point out that, after Ariel Sharon had proudly and artfully received him in the one, indivisible capital of the State of Israel, establishing quite a subversive interpretation of the Roadmap, Mr Berlusconi refused in exchange to meet Yasser Arafat and Abu Mazen."
"On this matter, I agree with the French Foreign Minister, Mr De Villepin, when he said that Mr Berlusconi 'had not satisfied the European position', which is one of wisdom, of dialogue with all."
"I therefore call upon you, Mr President, to remind Mr Berlusconi, not as Head of the Italian Government but as future President-in-Office of the Council and representative of a European institution, that the duty and objective of the European institutions is not to display or demonstrate friendship to peoples but to pursue a single goal, that of peace."
". (ES) Mr President, I have listened extremely closely to the speeches by the honourable Members of this Parliament."
"I believe that I have taken note of them all and we shall try to draw on them in the same spirit as that adopted by most Members who have spoken here this afternoon."
"We all have the same aim - an aim I believe we have shared for a long time and not just as of today - which is to find a formula that will enable us to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions, with the existence of two States that are able to live next to one another in peace and stability, in a region that is stable and in which the two States are recognised by all their neighbours."
"This is our earnest desire, our dream and what we want to become a reality as soon as possible."
"I wish to reply very briefly to the two questions put to me by Mr Menéndez del Valle."
"In response to the first, I am not aware of any bilateral agreement that addresses the issue of settlements."
"I am only aware of the 'Roadmap' as a whole."
"Secondly, there can be reservations, on the part of all those involved, provided that all Members of the 'Quartet' are willing to implement the Roadmap in its entirety."
"Thank you very much, Mr Solana."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the statements by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission on the security strategy for the European Union, including implementation of the United Nations programme to combat the illegal trade in light weapons."
". (ES) Mr President, I wish to inform you all, as succinctly and briefly as I can, about the work that is being undertaken on what could be called 'European security'."
"As you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, at the Rhodes meeting I was given the mandate to try to present, in time for the Thessaloniki European Council, a document on issues related to European security, although this will probably not be the last document on the matter."
"I must emphasise that what is significant is that for the first time the European Union wishes to have a document of this type; there is a desire not only for Member States to have their own documents, but also for the European Union, collectively, to have a document on its security strategy."
"I believe that this is a first, and I want to underline that this is a major step forwards in building a Europe which moves ahead by political means."
"First of all, I base my approach on a fundamental principle, which underpins the entire content of the document."
"A Europe of these dimensions, with 25 democratic countries, which will soon have a population twice as large as that of the United States of America and four times that of Japan (and I take as examples the large countries that, like ours, have a strong currency), a Europe which accounts for approximately one quarter of gross world product must not fail, I repeat, to be an international player."
"Whether we want to or not, we will have to be an international player."
"This principle, in which I firmly believe - and in which I hope you also believe, ladies and gentlemen - must underpin our entire approach to managing the process of achieving security in Europe."
"The document is about to be completed and will be presented to the Heads of Government next Thursday and Friday in Thessaloniki."
"I now wish to summarise its structure for you."
"It opens with an analysis of the security environment in which we live, which obviously includes regional conflicts and the causes of these conflicts that affect us: poverty, exclusion, or a lack of natural resources."
"The report then goes on to look at more recent threats such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and failed states."
"On the basis of this analysis, it moves on to a second chapter which addresses what must, in our opinion, be the main strategic objectives for Europe's security."
"Logically, the first strategic objective must be to extend and stabilise the security zone around the European Union, in other words, around our continent, specifically to the east and the south."
"I believe that the document that the Commission presented recently on the new Europe and Europe's borders is largely concerned with where and how the European Union should start developing its security environment."
"The second important point about strategic security objectives must, in our opinion, be to strengthen the international order."
"We could probably describe Europe's place in the international order in this way: we are effective multilateralists and it is on effective multilateralism that we must base our theory of the world order."
"For this reason, we are working and wish to continue working to protect Europe's security through all organisations and specifically through the United Nations."
"Of course, there are players that have more individual roles to play, such as the United States, the Russian Federation and other large countries or major international players."
"What I would like to say, however, and we have attempted to make the document reflect this deeply-considered idea, is that in order to ensure an effective multilateral system and more specifically the credibility of the United Nations system, we must in theory be prepared to ensure that all the principles on which the United Nations is founded are observed and that this organisation has the credibility that it deserves."
"When some of the principles underpinning the Charter and some Security Council resolutions are not observed, the European Union cannot remain passive and must act; and it must act with all the considerable means available to it."
"Fortunately, the European Union has a whole panoply of means for acting that range from diplomatic activity to armed peacekeeping action."
"Mr Hughes, who is not present at the moment, made a useful incidental observation on how the European Union can also play a major role in effective dialogue in the event of conflict."
"We must have the courage, however, to say to ourselves that when rules, the principles that we have all decided to defend in the context of this effective multilateralism are flouted, the European Union must also be willing to face up to this breach of international agreements or contracts, be they political or of any other type."
"Lastly, the third point that must be made is how to deal with the new threats, which are terrorism, the proliferation of weapons and failed states ..."
"On these issues which are new or which involve new aspects, although some of them have been around for many years, we have to say that they are risks and threats of a different kind to those that we have experienced before."
"The first difference is that they can be perpetrated from a distance."
"Throughout the cold-war era, we were used to having threats at our borders."
"Today we are facing perhaps the first threat situated far from our border and we consequently need to deploy our capacities beyond our borders."
"I therefore believe that when we were given the mandate in Helsinki, at the end of 1999, to start considering how the European Union could undertake civilian and military action, this possibility was also being considered."
"These new threats are also dynamic, and we must therefore prevent them and try, as soon as possible, to ensure that they are not allowed to become a reality, whether they are caused by hunger, climate change or other types of conflict, such as ethnic or religious struggles."
"I believe that swift prevention is an obligation incumbent upon us and must form one strand of the philosophy underlying the European Union's action."
"These new threats are more complex, more complicated than anything we have experienced before and consequently our response to them cannot be a simple one."
"We cannot respond to something that is complex with simplicity; our response must also be complex and it would, in my opinion, be a mistake to think that there can be a military solution to these problems."
"I do not believe that there can be and what we therefore have to do is make use of all the means, the entire panoply of means available to the European Union as a whole."
"These range, as I have said, from diplomacy, humanitarian aid, crisis management, trade, sanctions etc. to managing crises with military means."
"I believe, however, that it would be an extremely serious mistake to think that the only solution to this type is a military one."
"I also believe it would be wrong to think that the focus of the war against these new threats should be strictly military."
"To conclude, I should like the document to end with a call for a Europe with clearly-defined characteristics, a Europe that must be more active on the world stage and which must therefore have the political will to act."
"I hope that the debate that has taken place in recent months in the Convention leads to the conclusion, not only by Parliament but also by the citizens of our continent, that if we genuinely want to assume our rightful position in the world, with the wealth and the well-being that we enjoy, we also have obligations associated with these benefits and these obligations must be met."
"There must, therefore, be greater activity, a greater political will to act and this, I believe, is crucial."
"If we wish to act, therefore, we must have the capacity to act; and hence we must also make the necessary effort, which involves developing military and civilian capacities; and I cannot conceal the fact that having greater capacities to act and to exert influence in the world also requires more resources."
"This Parliament and national parliaments, national governments, will have to face up to this reality; otherwise our words will be somewhat hypocritical."
"We cannot cry when we see the suffering of others on television and yet not be willing to do what needs to be done."
"In order to do what needs to be done, we must have the resources and these resources are going to have to come from the citizens of our continent, of our own European Union, who will also have to be generous enough to pay for the resources necessary to undertake the action that we are being asked every day to carry out."
"In my first speech, I spoke about the operation in the Congo."
"This is an example of what we might have to do in future and it will surely be on a larger scale."
"We are able to undertake such action at the moment because of the means we can pool together, but also because of the means available to some nations in particular that can take on this role; others cannot."
"We must all, therefore, make an effort to maintain a level of capacities that will enable us to play the role we say we want to play."
"I repeat, the Europe we want is a Europe that has greater visibility, a will to act, and the means with which to put this will into practice; it is a Europe that also has the necessary coherence to act, and by this I mean that there must be coherence, within the European Union and in all of its institutions and between the European Union and its Member States so that the entire effort, for example the diplomatic effort, can bear fruit."
"Consider for a moment that the European Union's diplomatic network, with all of its Member States, would be considerably greater than that of the country with the largest diplomatic network."
"If we put it to the service of a cause, we would probably be a thousand times more effective than we are at the moment."
"I believe that the document that we shall be presenting to the Heads of State and Government on Thursday and Friday in Thessaloniki follows this approach, which I believe is in line with the ideas of most Members of this Parliament."
". Mr President, over the last three or four years the High Representative and I have made speeches on this subject which I guess you could measure by the metre, and if you were to look at them, you would find that they were all remarkably similar and reflected the arguments which the High Representative has put again so forcefully and ably today."
"In many respects it is remarkable that the European Union has proceeded so far and so fast towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and towards a Security and Defence Policy without the benefit - until now - of a formal Security Strategy."
"The Commission very much welcomes the decision to rectify that omission and looks forward to the debates that will take place on the strategy document which is going to come forward shortly."
"On the defence and military side there has been impressive progress in creating European capacities that the Union is already beginning to put to use."
"As the High Representative has said, we need to be explicit about our strategic purposes, and the circumstances in which the European Union might deploy force."
"As I have said before and as he has said, we also have to challenge our colleagues in government and our electorates about the gap which exists between ambition and what people are prepared to pay, and what people are prepared to cooperate over."
"The Commission, as I have said before, is not a silent and disinterested onlooker in this debate."
"We have no direct role in defence and military matters, and even in the absence of my honourable friend Mr Van Orden, I repeat that we do not aspire to a direct role in defence and military matters."
"But whatever the EU does militarily - whether in conflict prevention, crisis management or post-conflict reconstruction - is inevitably part of a wider European strategy including many elements for which the Commission does indeed have the lead responsibility."
"The European Union needs a seamless approach, which is why the High Representative and I - with our respective services - have worked so closely together, and why I am pleased that the European Convention has proposed even closer integration in future."
"The real point I want to make, however, is that defence and military issues are only one dimension - and for the European Union still a relatively small dimension - of any 'Security Strategy' which is worthy of the name."
"In a sense, the EU itself - its creation, its development and its enlargement - can be seen as a European Security Strategy, and it has been a brilliantly effective one."
"The Union has provided the central economic and political organising principle for our continent over the last half century, helping to secure democracy and stability for countries emerging from dictatorship and oppression."
"Through the Wider Europe agenda, too, we seek to extend stability to our neighbours and the circle of friends around us."
"Perhaps the central element in any security strategy for Europe must be to ensure that the EU itself continues to prosper and to develop."
"Beyond that, the EU is a major contributor to international security in a host of different contexts: through, for example, our contribution to global trade."
"The EU has played a central role in the creation and development of the World Trade Organisation, and we are now engaged in the Doha Development Round."
"It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of that work for global security, because security and prosperity are so closely intertwined."
"We also contribute to global security through external development assistance."
"I have pointed out to the House before that we are responsible - the EU, the Commission and Member States - for about 55% of all such assistance worldwide, and for about two-thirds of all grant assistance."
"That is a vital contribution to security because poverty and inequality are not just moral issues but also security issues."
"Through our assistance, too, we work for human rights and for better governance."
"Again, these are security issues linked, for example, to the fight against terrorism, because inequality and oppression are the breeding ground of hatred, intolerance and violence."
"Above all, however, the EU can contribute to international security through its work in - and support for - multinational frameworks and disciplines that are increasingly necessary and important for managing the affairs of an interdependent world."
"I am thinking here of UN disarmament and non-proliferation Conventions; environmental Treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change; and, of course, the International Criminal Court."
"I could go on - but the point is clear."
"We cannot simply divide between our security interests on the one hand and our development and trade interests on the other."
"In order to prevent future violent conflicts we have to have policies on environmental degradation, poverty and global governance, AIDS, Justice and Home Affairs, nuclear safety, and so on."
"I think the point is clear."
"So the underlying conclusion is that effective multilateralism should be the motto on the European Union's banner."
"That is the essence of our security strategy."
"I shall say a brief word about small arms and light weapons, because that too underlines the importance of practical and effective multilateralism."
"We are committed to combating the spread of small arms around the world."
"A code of conduct on arms exports was adopted five years ago, under which Member States set high common standards for the management of conventional arms transfers."
"The code has since established itself as a comprehensive international arms export regime."
"In a joint action covering small arms later in 1998 the EU pledged to promote a number of principles including commitments by all countries to supply small arms only to governments, and to import and hold arms exclusively for their legitimate security needs."
"The EU has set aside funds for the provision of financial and technical assistance to small arms programmes and projects around the world."
"I look forward to the publication of the document on security."
"As the High Representative said, this will be the beginning of a very important debate, and of course much of that debate will take place in these hallowed chambers."
"We look forward to hearing the contributions of honourable Members who have already made a significant contribution to the broader comprehension of security which is now shared throughout the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, it is my belief that events in the current and previous year have made apparent our real need for clear thinking on this issue."
"Commissioner Patten has described the many areas in which the European Union is actively involved, and it might well make sense for us to view them as parts of a coherent whole in order to make clear how much these - in many areas, thoroughly presentable - instruments benefit each other."
"This is where issues connected to overseas and development aid will of course be of correspondingly great importance."
"What this means is that potential tensions need to be reduced where the prevention of poverty is concerned, and both those actively involved and the European public need to become more aware of the fact that these are also instruments whereby we conduct foreign policy, and that they are in the interests of our Member States."
"In the context of this discussion about prevention, an area in which so much is being done, Mr Solana is indeed right to say, as he has done in this debate, that we have to find the right combination of prevention, military capacity, and the measures needed for reconstruction in the aftermath of action."
"I believe that there is something missing here, either in terms of awareness or of practice."
"If - as we are right to do - we do indeed perform these preventive tasks, we see that they, in themselves, do not give the European Union any greater influence, as the military option has to be available to us if we are to be able to make it clear that we could also take other kinds of action."
"This was our experience in the Balkans in the early 1990s, when the European negotiators brought about some thirty-four ceasefire agreements - I am not sure precisely how many - and the reason why none of them came to anything was that Milosevic knew perfectly well that we lacked the military capacity to ensure that these ceasefire agreements were kept to."
"Bit by bit, right up to the Cologne Summit, and, beyond that, in Saint-Malo and on many other occasions, we learned the necessary lessons from this, which have now enabled us to progress further."
"Here, too, though, we see that this must first be incorporated into a real strategy, that it is not yet fully operational, and that we do not yet know how it is to work, as, of course, we have to evaluate certain of its constituent parts in relation to this."
"What priority do we in fact give to combating terrorism, and to what extent do the instruments enable us to do that?"
"The argument adduced by the Americans in relation to the war in Iraq was also to some degree an argument about terrorism."
"Are we ourselves clear in our own minds about the extent to which traditional military means can be deployed to combat terrorism?"
"The same applies to the area of non-proliferation."
"If we could do as - for example - the Israelis did in Iraq in the early 1980s, and destroy a nuclear power plant with a single pre-emptive strike, thereby preventing the development of any nuclear capability, could this be part of such a strategy, one that might enable us, with less or scarcely any loss of human life, to develop capacities to prevent immense dangers and subsequent wars?"
"I believe that we have to answer these questions."
"On this occasion, I am framing them as questions, but they ought to form part of a specific and consistent approach if we are to be able to put something on the table in the way that the Bush administration has done, where we can identify both similarities and differences and will very definitely be enabled to conduct on a stable basis the dialogue with the United States that is necessary if we are to start working together or perhaps achieve a rapprochement, and that will help enable the Americans to abandon unilateralism."
"I agree that the European Union is itself a security policy measure; that is one of the primary reasons for its existence."
"The wider Europe that this is intended, astutely enough, to organise on a multilateral rather than merely bilateral basis, which is meant to be the European Economic Area with something added; our relations with Russia and the developing world and also with the Mediterranean countries - all these things are vitally important, but, in this context, we must indeed give some thought to the future of our relations with the United States, and it is my belief that, in the long term, NATO will not, on its own, be a sustainable bond between us."
"As regards NATO and transatlantic relations, there are two conditions, which we too must fulfil: only if we are strong will we be partners to be taken seriously, and there is no partnership when, rather than both sharing in decisions, one partner takes the decisions and the other merely follows behind."
"We have to play our part in creating the right conditions."
"The second point in relation to all this is that we have to put our relations on a broader basis, one that has to do with more than security policy and the military, and that is why we need again to seize the initiative and have the sort of discussions that we had at the beginning of the 1990s, which I might perhaps sum up under the heading of 'transatlantic market place' in order, on this basis, to put something in place in many of the areas in which the European Union is competent."
"We, and the USA, have treaties with every country on earth, but we have no treaty with each other."
"If such a strategy is to be complete, I believe that we should give some thought to this."
"Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, the development of a European security strategy is a major step forward."
"After all, by establishing the principles and objectives of the policy, it becomes more coherent and provides a framework for what has been achieved over the past few years."
"It does not guarantee that the European Union will also speak with one voice, but it does make it more logical and easier to do so."
"The confusion surrounding Iraq, but also the new US security strategy, lie behind today's debate."
"The need for such a debate, however, is born out of the European Union's increased ambition to play a greater security role."
"Fortunately, this ambition remains unabated even after this year's events."
"The details of the document to be presented in Thessaloniki are as yet unknown, but we assume, as Mr Solana has already indicated, that the strategy is based on a broad interpretation of security."
"A lack of security has many causes and requires a large number of varied instruments to combat it."
"New threats, such as international terrorism, require more attention."
"We also back the implementation of an EU action plan against the spread of weapons of mass destruction."
"Countries that violate agreements or form a great risk must be tackled, Iran being a case in point."
"The threat of violence should not, however, be the first line of attack, but the EU should also consider how the Treaty could be further reinforced to combat the spread of nuclear weapons."
"Over the past few months, much has been said about the European Union's deficient military capacity."
"We are said to offer too little counterweight to US supremacy."
"In my view, this is the wrong approach."
"It is not about having to outdo the Americans militarily, but about being able to act just as effectively in a different way and with a different combination of resources whenever we deem this necessary."
"This should not be done unilaterally - that is not our style - but within multilateral frameworks and, in particular, with the involvement of the UN."
"We have never ruled out the use of military force, but it should be seen as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted."
"It should be deployed effectively and proportionately."
"This is why, even after the event, we remain doubtful as to the justification of the war against Iraq."
"We hope that the EU strategy will be clear about the role of the military instrument."
"In the light of this philosophy, we nevertheless have to conclude that the development of the military dimension of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is trailing behind our ambitions."
"We therefore support the intentions to ratchet up the speed and develop more activities in this area, and we are prepared to hold an open discussion about the financial implications."
"Mr Solana made a passionate plea for an open debate of this kind a moment ago."
"At the same time, we are confident about another priority, namely conflict management and crisis management, being fully integrated in the new strategy."
"This is still the current CFSP's strongest asset."
"Closer to home, also in Europe, we operate more effectively than outside it."
"We assume that the High Representative is taking these experiences into consideration, and we are also looking forward to seeing how the strategy will work out for the different regions where the European Union wants to be active."
"When he and the Council work towards an approach characterised by what I indicated above, he can count on my group's unqualified support."
"A new and valuable discussion has commenced, and we want to take an active part in it."
"Mr President, as the High Representative said, a European Union of 25 countries, 450 million people and a quarter of the world's total national product must assume greater responsibility for its own security and defence; and, I would add, be less dependent upon our friends in the United States."
"That is in the interests of both the EU and the United States."
"That is something we owe to ourselves, as well as to the Americans who, for many years, have been the guarantors of peace in Western Europe."
"We therefore need closer institutional ties between NATO and the EU so that we might react more consistently to the new global challenges in terms of combating international terrorism, organised crime and the spread of weapons of mass destruction."
"The objective is therefore the continued development of the EU's defence dimension - which is also supported by the United States - as the European pillar within NATO."
"The EU must increasingly work in partnership with the Americans, and not in opposition to them."
"The transatlantic alliance can only be maintained in the long term if a proper European defence identity is introduced."
"The news we received from the foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg concerning a stronger and more pro-active foreign and defence policy was therefore encouraging, and it is with great excitement that we now await the High Representative's proposal for the first common European security strategy."
"We can be happy about the fact that the Council generally wishes to strengthen European defence and cooperation around research and development in this area, but the proposal should also fully support the re-establishment of the transatlantic partnership."
"In this connection, it has been gratifying to read what has been termed the Allbright declaration on this partnership."
"The declaration also states that the partnership is the supporting pillar of NATO cooperation."
"Mr President, it is strange to hear all the talk about European defence when we do not even have a common European foreign policy."
"I think that that is the task to which we first have to put our minds, and I should like to see us beginning to talk about what our priorities are to be."
"I think the main priority should be for the EU to be the mainstay of an international legal order and of international agreements and for it to be among those backing international weapons control."
"Some of those priorities have been given all too little weight for many years, and it is an obvious task for a specifically cooperative organisation like the EU, which is based upon agreements between old enemies."
"We must continue that tradition, extend it to the international level and ensure that we become the mainstay of the UN so that international law again comes to prevail."
"I should like to hear what the Council's and the Commission's plans are in anticipation of the UN meeting in July on the control of light weapons, for this is one of those areas in which the EU could have a role to play."
"We are of course one of the main producers of these weapons, and we also try to control them."
"We have a code of conduct from 1998 - mentioned, I believe, by Commissioner Patten - but, of course, weapons prove, all the same, to end up in the wrong hands and on the wrong markets."
"We need to follow this agreement up, with the possibility of monitoring weapons throughout their life cycle."
"We can do this with dairy cows in the EU."
"Would it not be marvellous if we could do the same with weapons?"
"What plans exist for doing so?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that when we are talking about security a double language is being used."
"There are those who say that our real security lies in mediation, cooperation and prevention."
"Then there are others who say that our security depends on our defence and intervention capacities and associate it more with military aspects."
"As far as I am concerned, the basis of our security is the credibility of our politics."
"Are we credible when in our association agreements with the Maghreb countries, for example, or other countries, we insert an Article 2 that talks about human rights and democracy and then quickly forget this article in our actual relations with these countries?"
"No, no one takes us seriously!"
"We sign association agreements and whenever things get complicated we forget one of the aspects of our security: being surrounded by democracies."
"The more democracies there are, the less the risk of war."
"Are we credible?"
"Elmar Brok is right when he asks if we were credible in the Balkans. No."
"We proclaimed: peace, peace, peace."
"Men were massacred and we had no power to intervene."
"We therefore were not credible."
"When we are told that our positions must be consistent with those of the Americans, that we must not go against the Americans, I say that we should be neither for or against the Americans."
"Yet is it credible to say that we are going to war because there are weapons of mass destruction when in fact there are none and it is a lie?"
"We are not credible."
"Do Europeans have the right to say that a lie is a lie?"
"Are all pro-Americans still annoyed when we say that the Americans lied, that Colin Powell lied in the Security Council?"
"Let us take another example."
"Are we credible when we invoke international law as an argument?"
"Yet is international law, as it exists today, the Bible?"
"No."
"Is a Security Council without Brazil, without India, without South Africa a Security Council for today's world?"
"No."
"Therefore, fighting for international law is to fight to reform it, to change it."
"We must stop saying the same thing over and over: international law as it currently stands came from the Cold War and the Cold War is no longer our problem."
"I will end with a comment on terrorism."
"Once again, are we credible in this respect when on the one hand, along with others, we quite rightly say that we had to intervene in Afghanistan to combat the terrorism, yet on the other hand we remain silent on everything that has happened in Guantanamo?"
"Fighting and struggling against terrorism is to fight and struggle for the rule of law, wherever it may be, during war and in the different forms of war."
"If we do not succeed in resolving these problems together, we are not credible."
"Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the basis of security is credibility."
"Mr President, the presence here of the European Union's two representatives for foreign policy, for whom I have a great deal of respect, is the result of the current operating requirements of the Union, not a peculiar sort of Dioscuri syndrome."
"This confirms that the choice to create an EU 'minister for foreign affairs' is the right choice, but I hope that he will not function later on like Janus who, according to mythology, changed his face to suit the circumstances."
"During the last decade, we have increasingly noticed the difference between the European Union and the USA on important issues."
"The International Court for crimes against humanity, the Middle East crisis, the crisis in Iraq, the general perception about preventive war and so on. In practice, this gives rise to the need for the European Union to define its own independent strategy so that, on the basis of this independence, it can redefine its relations with America and correct its mistakes."
"This redefinition is a sine qua non, because the axis of the Union's strategy must again rest on its relations with the USA."
"Good accounts make good friends."
"What, however, should this strategy rest on?"
"On certain positions in principle and an equal footing."
"And an equal footing, in this particular case, means parity."
"What does parity mean?"
"That you have your own opinion, but you also have your own capabilities so that, if necessary, you can formulate your opinion as a policy, negotiate it and obtain results."
"We are in a new era."
"So-called one-sided threats are completing older procedures and crisis conditions and thus the European Union is obliged de facto to play a new international role."
"And personality on strategy issues is precisely what the new international role calls for."
"This personality cannot result from minor moves."
"It must be the result of an international analysis, an international definition of its personality and its principles."
"I believe that we shall do well and that Mr Solana's proposals will be the first step towards the Union's subsequently acquiring independence in its relations with all the powers of the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics are sufficiently known."
"Some half a billion small arms and light weapons are in circulation worldwide, more than half of which are illegal."
"In 46 of the 49 major conflicts since 1990, weapons of this kind were used."
"These weapons are also largely responsible for the phenomenon of child soldiers."
"Small arms and light weapons are easy to come by, in some places for USD 15; they are easy to operate, easy to conceal and transport and, above all, are ever so deadly."
"According to an independent study in 2001, small arms claim the lives of more than 1 000 people, mainly innocent people, every day."
"Internationally, there are hardly any rules in the area of the production and spread of small arms and light weapons."
"The Ottawa Treaty on the use of anti-personnel mines forms an exception to this."
"Unfortunately, we have to establish that the largest producers of small arms and light weapons, namely the US, Russia and China, are also the most fervent opponents to international legislation in the style of Ottawa."
"In order to get a real grip on the proliferation of small arms, transparency is what is first and foremost required."
"The UN register for conventional weapons should be opened to this category of weapons."
"The rules on arms exports must be stepped up."
"The application of identifying marks during the production of new weapons must become compulsory, so that their origins can be traced more easily."
"I share Commissioner Patten's view that the 1998 European code of conduct should serve as a model for a worldwide, binding agreement on arms exports and transfers."
"During the UN Conference next July, the European Union should take the lead in the fight against the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons."
"Indeed, there is a risk that all efforts in the field of conflict prevention will be in vain if the root causes are not tackled."
"Mr President, we need to look at where the light weapons are actually coming from."
"In recent events in the Congo, approximately 50 000 people have been victims of the use of light weapons."
"We are also sending soldiers to stop the fighting there despite the fact that most of the fighting is taking place with weapons supplied by countries within the European Union."
"People in the Congo have not actually made these weapons: they have come from countries in the EU - including France, Belgium, the UK, etc. and elsewhere."
"There seems to be a complete contradiction: we are sending people to stop the fighting in places where the weapons used originate in the countries of origin of the so-called 'fighting preventers'."
"In relation to the UN review on the programme of action coming up in July 2003, we also need to look at things that remain to be done."
"We must close loopholes on the end-use of weapons; on where they actually go and how are they used."
"There is a serious loophole in relation to where weapons go, who uses them and what the end consequence is."
"We also need to tackle very seriously the brokers of arms."
"There are people making huge amounts of money by dealing in arms, by ensuring that countries and people can actually get arms from the arms suppliers."
"As Mrs Frahm mentioned in relation to registration, it is absolutely incredible that you can actually trace a piece of meat or an agricultural product, yet you cannot trace a lethal weapon."
"It is about time the EU owned up to its responsibility and made it impossible for light arms to be traded like this, causing the death and destruction of many innocent people."
"Mr President, the threat that emanates from the large, uncontrolled flows of small arms and the risk of the proliferation of criminal organisations and terrorist groupings has gained relevance since 11 September."
"Globally, more than half a billion small arms are in circulation."
"The use of these arms is responsible for the death of about 500 000 people every year."
"Small arms claim 300 000 victims in wars and roughly another 200 000 in non-war situations."
"In Bowling for Columbine, the documentary maker, Michael Moore, showed recently the consequences small arms have, even in a country such as the United States: homicides at secondary schools, among youth gangs and in the criminal world."
"Invariably, the weapons have been obtained illegally."
"Many people are, however, the victims of small arms and light weapons, including in conflicts such as the present one in Congo."
"In order to combat the illegal trade in small arms, adequate legislation is required, as well as regulations with regard to the trade in - and production, transit and possession of - small arms, and the distributive trade in weapons must also be monitored."
"Weapons must be easy to trace and therefore be provided with a clear mark."
"Moreover, records must be kept and it must be possible to exchange this information."
"To prevent small arms from entering the illegal circuit, adequate stock management, safe transport and storage, and the destruction of surplus weapons are necessary."
"In the light of the UN Conference in New York in three weeks' time, it is important for the EU to play a pioneering role once again."
"It can do this by calling for proper monitoring procedures for these weapons, by stepping up existing legislation on monitoring the distributive trade, by insisting on effective traceability and clear marking of weapons, and by pressing home all these requests by being the first in Europe to tackle this legislation."
"I often talk about the importance of Europe speaking with one voice."
"This step towards unity has been made by the fact that six groups in the European Parliament are united in making this plea."
"The Council and the Member States are still to follow suit."
"I hope that they will follow this example."
"Mr President, I wish to speak, like my fellow Members who have just spoken, about trafficking and the fight against the illegal trade in light weapons."
"As in 2001, when the United Nations Conference on the illegal trade in light weapons was held and we welcomed the action plan, we now welcome the assessment meeting that will take place next month."
"Precisely with regard to this assessment meeting, we wish to recall, as has already been said, that 500 million small arms and light weapons are at large in the world and cause thousands of deaths every day, according to the 2001 Independent Weapons Study."
"Furthermore, most of the victims are women and children."
"The illegal trade in small arms and light weapons to developing countries, which are often embroiled in conflicts, originates mainly in Member States of the European Union, in addition -as has also already been pointed out - to the United States and Russia."
"The Conference and the action plan now under review have not managed to establish a binding international legal instrument that prohibits illegal trading."
"The European Union must focus its efforts on producing a code of conduct that prevents weapons reaching these warring countries, regimes that systematically breach human rights and armed groups that, as has already been said, recruit child soldiers."
"We should, therefore, translate these aims into joint action, first by the Member States, whose national laws on the matter are - unfortunately - totally disparate, and then apply these to the international community as a whole."
"The assessment meeting presents a good opportunity to achieve this."
"Light weapons must fall under the control of an international system, as has been done with anti-personnel mines and chemical and biological weapons."
"The European Union should, therefore, take the following proposals to New York: firstly, to establish an international registry of weapons sales; secondly, a specific ban on the sales of light weapons to regimes that breach human rights and thirdly, to establish a system for tracing weapons."
"Together with these requests to the Council and to the Member State governments, requests that we put forward in the resolution we would like to see adopted, we also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to step up its cooperation in demobilising armed groups in developing countries."
"At present this applies most particularly to Africa."
"The current conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia amongst others demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the policy we have implemented to date and the need to monitor weapons sales."
"(ES) Mr President, out of courtesy to the Members of the European Parliament who have kindly remained with us until the end, I wish to say that the European Union will be embarking on a new exercise, that it will attempt to undertake this exercise as seriously as possible and that it is going to present a document on security strategy, the first ever, in a few days in Thessaloniki, which will certainly be followed by a mandate from the Heads of State and Government to continue working on it."
"I also believe - as many speakers have said - that it is good news that the European Union can now start thinking seriously and jointly about a common security strategy."
"In order for this to happen, however - and I repeat what several speakers have said - it is absolutely crucial not only to have in place good documents and good structures; there must also be the political will to act in worldwide organisations in a way that reflects the European Union's significance in terms of population, wealth, etc. if the political will to do so exists, it can be done."
"Otherwise, however magnificent the papers we produce on the subject might be, they will again be simply papers and nothing else."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to hold this debate and I am sure that the next time, the attendance in the House will be somewhat greater."
"The next item is a statement by the Commission on the future of the textile agreement in WTO negotiations."
"Madam President, as we all know, the textiles and clothing sector occupies a prominent place in international trade, with flows of EUR 350 000 million in 2002."
"That is more than 5% of all world exports."
"It is a key sector for the developing countries."
"It accounts for 50% of world textiles exports and 70% of world clothing exports."
"For many of them it is the main source of exports and of industrial employment."
"For us Europeans, too, investment, the move upmarket and the world leadership we have acquired in a sector like fashion have also made it a key sector for the future."
"Europe is now the world's biggest exporter in textiles and the second largest in clothing."
"In today's Europe, 2 million people are employed in textiles and clothing, and in the enlarged Europe that will be 2.5 million and a turnover of EUR 200 000 million."
"Knowing how sensitive textiles and clothing are in a large number of countries, the European Commission organised an international conference on 5 and 6 May last, which was attended by delegates from over 80 countries."
"We discussed the challenges facing the sector in the years ahead, especially with the final abolition of quotas on 1 January 2005, which is also the proposed date for the conclusion of the current World Trade Organisation negotiations."
"Four major findings emerged from that conference."
"Firstly, the developing countries are very vulnerable, especially those that are the most dependent on textiles and clothing exports."
"This is especially true of the least advanced countries and those with weak or not very diversified economies."
"It is also the case of the countries which have preferential agreements with us, like the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, some of the ACP countries and other small exporters."
"Most of these countries depend very much on the textiles and clothing sector for their export revenue, since it may account for virtually all their exports and much of their employment."
"Secondly, market access conditions in textiles and clothing differ greatly from one part of the world to another."
"While Europe imposes customs duties averaging 9%, for example, many countries have duties as high as 30% or even higher, as well as retaining major non-tariff barriers. If we therefore confine liberalisation to abolishing quotas in 2005, we are likely to be faced with an unbalanced world market where competition is, as it were, focussed on the markets of the industrialised countries, our markets, where growth is weak."
"Thirdly, the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"That is the natural area of competition for the European industry."
"I will come back to this."
"We have projects concerning it."
"Fourthly, increasing competition is likely to intensify pressure on natural and human resources and presents serious problems in terms of sustainable development, but also of conditions of fair competition where fundamental social rights are involved, for example."
"Having identified these issues, what are the answers, answers that must of course be found not by us, or by the Americans, or by the Indians or by the Chinese, but found through talks with all the parties concerned in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation?"
"The first answer is development."
"If we are to alleviate the effects on the poorer and weaker countries of abolishing quotas, we must think how to concentrate the preferential access we grant to the developing countries, through the generalised system of preferences, for example, on what will probably be the most vulnerable countries."
"I am thinking of the least developed countries."
"I am thinking of the ACP group of countries."
"I am thinking of the small economies."
"We will also have to look at ways of making it easier for the countries concerned to make use of those preferences - I am thinking of the rules of origin, for example - while ensuring, of course, that those countries are indeed the ones which really benefit from the preferences we give."
"Secondly, we must use the Doha round to obtain market access conditions that are fair and similar all over the world."
"We cannot be satisfied with confining the opening of markets to the abolition of quotas in 2005."
"As I said, that would create imbalances in terms of access; but our present proposal in multilateral talks is based on arguments of fairness."
"We are calling on all the other members of the WTO to move their customs duties towards a common level, the lowest possible, and obviously to abolish non-tariff barriers. All countries, except, to our mind, the least developed countries, must contribute to this, including of course those whose textiles and clothing exports are highly competitive."
"I would like to use this debate to reassure both the European industry and the countries which enjoy preferential access to the Union's markets."
"It is not our intention to further reduce our already quite low customs duties without getting wider access to external markets in return."
"We also think changes should be made gradually, with transitional periods for the application of common customs duties to allow those who have problems to make the necessary adjustments."
"Thirdly, the Euro-Mediterranean area."
"It is in the process of becoming integrated and it should soon enjoy the expected benefits of the pan?Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin rules that should come into effect in the very near future."
"This new protocol on rules of origin should be presented to the trade ministers at the Euromed conference in Palermo on 7 July next."
"This system of diagonal cumulation of origin will allow economic operators in the Euromed area as a whole to expand their potential sources of supply by allowing producers in that area, which will be unified from this point of view, to use intermediate products from the whole of the area without any barriers."
"We expect this to have a positive effect on trade, contributing to the development of intra-regional trade in particular."
"Our aim is to be able to apply this cumulation effectively in all the countries of the area by the end of 2004."
"Lastly, the promotion of sustainable development: we must give priority to incentives and respect for multilateral norms."
"We must continue to look at how public action can ensure that liberalisation will not be detrimental to working conditions or the environment and prevent non-compliance with social or environmental standards being used as a competitive advantage."
"We might, for example, consider increasing tariff preference margins within the Generalised System of Preferences for countries which apply these international standards, or encouraging private programmes for promoting sustainable development, or, again, looking at ways of increasing consumer information on products so as to give the fair trade option to those consumers that want it."
"As you can see, and I will end here, the European Commission is very much aware of what is at stake in the textiles and clothing sector in terms of sustainable development, the fight against poverty, industrial and social policy and regional balances within the Union."
"It is a sector where the questions of fair distribution of the benefits of trade and globalisation are keenly felt and a sector that offers us the possibility of developing industrial and commercial policies that do justice to all these legitimate concerns."
"In the European Commission we have begun a study to identify the categories of products most at risk, the effects of liberalisation on production, its effects on employment in the enlarged Union and its impact in the regions that are the most dependent on textiles production."
"Both sides of industry are following these developments very closely with us in a sectoral social committee."
"We are also holding talks with the economic and social partners to identify what further measures might be taken to encourage competitiveness in the sector."
"Finally, my colleague, Mr Erkki Liikanen, and myself are planning to present a communication on commercial and industrial policy in the textiles and clothing sector after 2005 to the Members of the Commission next autumn and then to Parliament and the Council in order to provide - as is our mission - all the parties concerned with a clear, predictable and coherent framework that will enable them, for their part, to plan their strategies, investments and activities."
"We must join forces to show the way forward for the textiles and clothing sector as a whole."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank you for being here today and for the statement you have just made, which attests to the sensitivity you have shown throughout the years towards the European textile and clothing sector."
"In its recent Communication on industrial policy, the Commission acknowledges that the vitality and dynamism of the industry are crucial to Europe's ability to maintain and increase its prosperity and at the same time achieve its social ambitions."
"From this statement we can infer the need for a European industrial policy which, in order to be effective, must not only cover the strictly industrial aspects, but must also be a horizontal policy that embraces, amongst others, the social and environmental aspects and above all, trade policy."
"And if this is valid and necessary for industry in general, and to preserve jobs, it is even more so in the case of the European textile and clothing industry, which has a turnover of EUR 196 billion every year, involves more than 113 000 businesses, provides work for two million people - or 7.6% of total employment in the manufacturing industry - and is characterised by significant regional concentration."
"Although everyone is aware of these figures, I believe they are worth repeating, because they demonstrate the sector's importance."
"This is furthermore a dynamic and competitive industry which, thanks to the efforts made in research and technological development, thanks to the design and quality of the products and as a result of its having specialised, has been able to consolidate and increase its influence and importance for the European and the world economy."
"It is accordingly worth recalling that the industry in Europe is the world's largest exporter of textiles, ahead of China, and the third largest in clothing, after China and Hong Kong and consequently has enormous export potential, which needs to be developed."
"This is precisely why trade policy is so important."
"Furthermore, however, this sector faces many challenges, in particular - and this is something to which you also referred - the challenge of the quota restriction as of 1 January 2005, which will mean a radical change in the world's commercial landscape."
"The sector is very aware of this, since it is one of the most exposed to the effects of globalisation through the stiff competition it faces due to the lower wage costs and the large export capacity of many developing countries."
"Another challenge facing the industry is China's accession to the WTO, and by way of illustration, it is worth recalling those studies predicting that once quantity restrictions are eliminated, China could see a 150% increase in its global textile and clothing exports and could consequently gain 50% of the world market share."
"It is therefore crucial for Europe that markets are genuinely and universally opened up, especially in those countries that are particularly dominant and competitive in the textile and clothing sector but which remain closed to European exports, either as a result of high customs duties, in addition to further duties and taxes, or by means of non-tariff barriers that make trade with those countries unviable."
"What is needed, Commissioner, for the sector's survival at European level and for the continued existence of the millions of jobs that are at stake is above all a defensive trade policy."
"I can therefore only welcome the content of the statement you have just made and simply express my hope that when it comes to discussing your proposals at the WTO, they are truly allowed to prosper."
"We know that reconciling the totally legitimate interests of European industry with the need to make the development agenda a reality will not be easy, but you do have this Parliament's full support for achieving this, Commissioner."
"Madam President, thank you Commissioner for being here with us today and for the statement you have made."
"You should be in no doubt that you have the support of all parliamentary groups, including mine, of course, for all the measures and positions that you have announced for the forthcoming discussions in the World Trade Organisation."
"Less than two months ago, Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy held a hearing, at which one of the speakers was the Chairman of Euratex, the textile employers' association, who concluded his speech by asking what we could do to solve the problems facing the textile industry."
"From these benches, I now wish to say, in line with the Commission, that these sittings constitute part of the answers that the sector is asking us to provide in order to remedy an extremely serious situation, which I will not go into again, since the Commissioner is fully aware of it."
"With regard to issues of market access, the Commissioner has said that until other Member countries demonstrate greater openness, we will not lower tariffs and customs duties."
"I should like to ask you whether, since there is such a significant imbalance between the amounts we charge and those charged by other countries, in the event that significant agreements are not concluded in this field, we can once again put forward the idea of increasing customs duties to whatever level we wish on textile products imported from these other countries that are not willing to lower their own."
"Lastly, Commissioner, I wish to ask you a very specific question concerning the recognition of industrial property rights."
"We are frequently told by representatives of the textile sector that, with regard to some of these property rights, such as design, which is not as visible as others such as trademarks, although countries have signed TRIPs agreements within the World Trade Organisation, they tend not to comply with them."
"I should like to ask you whether you intend to take any action on this matter."
"Madam President, I also congratulate Commissioner Lamy for agreeing to conduct this debate, which we proposed. He regrets, however, that it could not finally be resolved, as the central hypothesis was not accepted by the majority parties, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Some of my fellow Members have already commented here on the huge importance of the textile and clothing industry in the European Union, but it should be remembered that this industry is concentrated above all in southern European countries, in less prosperous regions."
"I am thinking in particular of two significant areas in Portugal, Covilhã and the Ave Valley."
"It must also be borne in mind, however, that after enlargement we will have to add almost 600 000 more jobs to the two million already included in this sector, and many hundreds of thousands more in areas of industrial production such as Germany and Italy."
"We all know that restructuring in this sector has already led many firms to relocate to the east of Europe or to African or Asian countries, and that this has led to an increase in unemployment in the European Union."
"We also know that we cannot do without a full evaluation of the social, economic and territorial effects both of the bilateral agreements already signed and of possible greater liberalisation after the current Agreement on Textiles and Clothing expires at the end of next year."
"For these reasons, then, we believe that it is essential to adopt an action plan introducing practical measures aimed at maintaining a harmonious, efficient production line. Support for SMEs, research and professional training should also be increased."
"During the current Doha agenda negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), however, it is essential that specific features of the textile and clothing sector be taken into account. In particular, reciprocity should be guaranteed in future agreements and trading relations between the European Union and third countries in this sector."
"The European textile industry can no longer be used as a bargaining chip in other negotiations on the service or hi-tech sectors."
"In order to maintain rates of employment and development throughout vast areas of the European Union, customs duties must be kept at their current levels, which are in any case among the lowest in the world. Neither fresh cuts nor the removal of non-tariff barriers must be accepted in this sector, except on a reciprocal basis, always taking the tariffs actually imposed as a starting-point rather than those made known to the WTO."
"I attach the greatest importance to the establishment of some sort of watchdog, made up of representatives of employers, employees and the Commission, to monitor how the situation develops. This body would function as an early warning system designed to bring any problems arising to a speedy resolution."
"Madam President, like many other Members I am very concerned about this lack of planning a such a late stage, when we have known for some time that tariffs were changing in 2005."
"I am not convinced that we are hearing answers that are going to deal with the total exploitation that exists in a lot of the textile industries in many countries throughout the world - whether through child labour, poverty wages or whatever."
"As has been mentioned, we are already seeing a shift in production from the European Union to other countries."
"I was in Athens last week looking at the case of Schiesser-Palco, an underwear producer - they promised me a sample for the Commissioner but the post has not managed to deliver on that!"
"That company is relocating 500 jobs to Bulgaria."
"The workers there resent being seen as a cheap option when they believe that they are already working for poverty wages, but in a high-unemployment situation it is very difficult to resist taking any job that is available."
"We are seeing the same sort of relocation through India, Sri Lanka, Latin America and China - where, we are told, the future of textile manufacturing lies."
"I am not convinced that we have had an answer yet as to what is possible under current WTO rules, which means that it can be very difficult to resist imports on the current process and production rules, and difficult to differentiate on labour standards and so on."
"There seems to be a push coming from certain quarters that corporate social responsibility and consumer power should be the key tools in ensuring standards throughout the consumer chain."
"It will be left to campaigners like Clean Clothes and No Sweat to make sure that labour and environmental standards are maintained."
"I am interested to know exactly what we think is possible under the current WTO rules, and whether the Commission agrees with the Vice-President of Levi-Strauss, who was arguing that ILO standards should be part of all bilateral and multilateral trade agreements."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his reassuring words of introduction to this delicate matter."
"From 1 January 2005, the textile industry will indeed face a great challenge: after that date, quantitative restrictions on access to European Union, United States and Canadian markets will be lifted for all members of the World Trade Organisation."
"In accordance with the Doha Development Agenda, the aim of this measure is to channel the liberalisation of international trade in such a way as to benefit developing countries."
"The textile industry is very important in these countries."
"I would mention India, Pakistan and China in particular."
"China is a typical case: the World Bank predicts that its textile exports will double in the next five years."
"As the Commissioner mentioned, this sector is tremendously significant. The jobs of 2 000 000 people and total revenues of EUR 200 billion depend on it."
"After expansion, the number of people employed in this sector will rise to over 2 500 000."
"This industry has one of the longest traditions in my country's economic structure. Portugal is one of the biggest textile and clothing producers in the Union."
"Its exports in this sector represent 20% of its total exports."
"Portuguese textile products are a feature of all the major world markets, especially in the European Union and the United States."
"The Portuguese textile and clothing industry is mainly composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, almost exclusively concentrated in the north of the country."
"Under these circumstances, it is vital to reflect at length on how to minimise the negative effects and maximise the potential released for European Union businesses by liberalised markets."
"It is essential to consolidate those features which will allow European textile companies to compete on the open market."
"The only possible methods of maintaining and increasing the significance and importance of the textiles and clothing sector in the European and world economies are research, technological development, information technology, training and professional development."
"The institutions concerned should guarantee that conditions favour competitiveness and respect for international commercial law. In particular, they should combat starvation wages and child labour, as well as promoting improvements in welfare and health benefits, guarantees of basic employment rights, and the adoption of anti-fraud and other provisions."
"In the specific case of Portugal, the next step should be a round of multilateral negotiations, under the auspices of the Doha Development Agenda, which will then be translated into tariff harmonisation and removal of non-tariff barriers. In practice, this will allow access to the market."
"We are aware of the great challenge we are facing. We maintain that future negotiations should be conducted thoroughly, without rushing, in order to achieve a balance between the Doha development commitments and the interests of the Union textile and clothing industry."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some of my fellow Members have already commented that 2005 will be a key date for the textiles and clothing sector."
"The Commissioner's speech soothed and calmed our worries, but did not banish them completely."
"The proposals and strategy he set out for us here today seem to be moving in the right direction."
"The European textiles and clothing sector has been tossed on many threatening and stormy seas."
"We must also remember that it was the first sector in Europe to be affected by the industrial revolution."
"This sector should be treated with care, not considered redundant, as occasionally seems to be the case in the discourse of certain Eurocrats and negotiators."
"For it is exposed to competition from products which, as we all know, are produced at minimal labour costs, in truly dire social conditions."
"Naturally, Commissioner, Portugal appears anxious and expectant, as do other European regions and countries."
"Some of my fellow Members have already said that this is a vital issue for Portugal, especially for northern areas of the country, and this point always bears repeating."
"Are other countries, such as France, for example, not worried by the liberalisation of agricultural markets?"
"Does France not fight for the famous principal of cultural exception?"
"Since that is the case, it should come as no surprise that other countries of the European Union, with very significant industries and sectors in social and economic terms, demand justice and the proper defence of their rights, and will not make exceptions."
"Encouraging poorer countries to develop is an ideal shared by all of us, particularly those on the left, such as myself."
"Not, however, to the detriment of the most vulnerable economies and poorest citizens in the European Union."
"That is false justice."
"The cost of the complete liberalisation of the textile industry will not be distributed fairly if the negotiations are badly managed by all countries and companies involved."
"Some will lose more than others, and the European spirit will be the weaker for it."
"I wish you every success in the negotiations, Commissioner."
"Moreover, when we are able to assess their results, we hope to be able to praise and applaud you as we have done in hope here today."
"Madam President, I too appreciated Commissioner Lamy's statement, although I am quite aware that the future of textiles and clothing companies, which are already in difficulties because of the appreciation of the dollar, will depend on the decisions made within the WTO."
"Removing quantitative barriers should provide a chance of growth even for the small and medium-sized enterprises which operate in the textiles regions of Europe."
"These enterprises must be able to extend their interests to new markets and invent new forms of cooperation with the countries entering the international market."
"The abolition of the MultiFibre Agreement will, however, lead to a situation which is characterised by more intense, concentrated competition in the mature markets."
"We are not, of course, asking for protectionist measures; on the contrary, we are calling for more open, transparent markets, as Mrs Ferrer has said."
"It is inevitable that globalisation of the markets should facilitate the decentralisation of many traditional activities towards developing countries, where production costs are lower."
"The fight to eradicate poverty and disseminate prosperity must be furthered by the elimination of customs barriers, but the fact cannot be disregarded that the activities of many European industries are under greater threat from social and environmental dumping than from economic competition."
"We would therefore like to focus on a number of points mentioned by the Commissioner."
"Access must be improved for Community products, which are usually of higher quality, to third markets, many of which are protected by high duties and non-tariff barriers."
"The liberalisation process must go hand in hand with a guarantee of reciprocity, as the Commissioner has rightly said."
"The textiles and clothing industry must be shielded from unfair competition, which means that minimum standards of protection of the working environment must be guaranteed."
"Lastly, given our experiences in other fields, not least, we should explore the possibility of launching a process which makes a quality label mandatory for textiles and clothing products, to provide a guarantee to the consumer but also to curb the flows of illegal imports which jeopardise economic growth and the proper functioning of international trade."
"Madam President, for us in Greece, the textile sector is particularly important, both for our industry and for the economy as a whole."
"Unfortunately, the Palko clothing factory closed recently, turning hundreds of workers out into the street."
"In the face of this worrying picture, there are a further two elements which, I think, add to our concerns."
"First, we have what is, of course, an unavoidable reduction in duty from the end of 2004, beginning of 2005, on third country imports and, secondly, we have the perennial problem of third countries, especially Pakistan and the countries of the Far East, giving their textile industries visible or invisible subsidies."
"Obviously, this situation needs to be addressed."
"I shall refer, by way of example, to four areas of action."
"First, an observatory needs to be set up on our part so that we can monitor third country subsidies and report them both to the World Trade Organisation and wherever else necessary."
"Secondly, a systematic effort must be made for our quality products to penetrate third countries, by dealing with the various ways this effort is being circumvented by third countries."
"Thirdly, we need to turn our attention to imitation products."
"A proposal has already been submitted for a label which should be adopted on our part."
"Other proposals can also be adopted, but the most important thing is for us to agree on the objective and, fourthly, given that this sector is important for employment, I think that the European Union should use European Commission programmes to help reinforce the sector."
"This can be done both through the community support framework and outside the community support framework, especially in the field of research and technology and innovation so that we can reinforce the sector as regards competitiveness, which is the key word."
"I think that the Commissioner is moving in the right direction, but we all need to urge him to step up his efforts so that we can address the huge problem that we appear to face."
"Madam President, I would like first of all to thank the groups that have expressed their support for this strategy, which I have tried to outline in answer to your questions."
"I will now respond to the few further points raised in your speeches."
"Mrs Ferrer, I share your vision for the future of the textiles and clothing sector in Europe."
"There is a word for it: dynamism."
"It is a vision of an industry on the offensive."
"The textiles and clothing industry is not an industry of the past whose gradual shrinkage needs to be managed as painlessly as possible."
"That is not my view of it, and it is not yours."
"It is not the idea behind our commercial and industrial policies."
"It is also what I understood from what Mr Lage said."
"Mr Berenguer Fuster, indeed, we will continue to lower our tariff protection only if others do the same."
"Whether you call it reciprocity or you call it something else, it is the basis of our policy."
"And you are right to stress, as Mr Hatzidakis also does, that there are intellectual property issues behind all that and that it is important that we continue to fight - as we are doing over geographical ascriptions, for example - to ensure that everything that makes for quality, everything that is of good taste, everything to do with design and that is often our comparative advantage is not illegally imitated and therefore, in a way, stolen."
"Mrs Figueiredo, yes, we are working on the impact of further liberalisation on employment, on the regional fabric and on skills."
"It is in fact part of the idea we are working on with Mr Erkki Liikanen for a post-2005 strategy that we would like to be able to present in the autumn of this year."
"Mrs Lambert and Mrs Read have stressed the link between trade and fundamental social norms."
"To the question: can we make this link?"
"Yes, we can make it in our unilateral commercial policy."
"When we give advantages, we can give additional advantages by establishing this link, and that is what we are doing."
"Yes, we can do it at bilateral level."
"When we enter into association agreements or trade agreements with some third countries, observance of fundamental social norms is part of our bilateral agreements."
"Yes, we can do it by working, as we have started to do - and as Mr Bodrato has suggested - on fair-trade labelling, which allows consumers, citizen consumers, to choose between products manufactured under conditions that are more or less sustainable from a social and environmental point of view."
"On the other hand, no, we cannot for the present do it multilaterally."
"We have tried, we Europeans."
"It was virtually the only failure at Doha: on this point we came up, at multilateral level, against a coalition of refusals formed by the United States on the one hand and the developing countries on the other."
"This link is not therefore part of the programme that will take us to the end of 2004."
"We will have to come back to it later."
"Mr Bastos, I agree with your concept of fair negotiations."
"But we must make a distinction, in social matters, between, on the one hand, the basic social norms - child labour, equal pay for men and women, trade union rights, a ban on forced labour - that are part of the multilateral commitments given by most of the countries on this planet, and, on the other hand, wage norms."
"We know that wages in the developing countries are lower than here."
"In a way, they are lower by definition because otherwise they would not be developing countries. That does not mean we do not all want to see them rise."
"Mr Ettl is right: non-tariff barriers often replace tariff barriers when they are removed."
"In a way, we have become experts in detecting, attacking and dealing with this kind of device, and we are constantly improving our information system, together with our partners on both sides of industry, so that we can detect such practices better, sooner and more quickly, since in many cases they are in fact incompatible with international trade rules."
"These are the answers I wanted to give."
"I will conclude by saying that in a sense this sector is a textbook case of globalisation as we Europeans and the European Commission conceive it."
"Yes, globalisation has its effects."
"Yes, globalisation results in relocation."
"Yes, it is a challenge to our competitiveness, our creativity and our skills."
"That is why we need public policies to create a framework that will allow the sector to continue to move upmarket, to continue to create added value, to continue to increase in quality."
"That is only possible if the rules of the game are established and followed."
"That used to be true at national level."
"It has become true at European level."
"It is in the process of becoming true at world level."
"Thank you, Commissioner Lamy, especially for your straightforward reactions to MEPs' points of view."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9.05 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I do indeed wish to take the floor on a point of order, specifically to invoke the Rules of Procedure."
"We were surprised yesterday to be presented with a new and very lengthy set of amendments. These were tabled as compromise amendments, but they are not in fact compromise amendments, since no compromise was reached on any of the amendments tabled in Parliament."
"They represent a whole new approach, which we know to be the clear result of the last Council meeting."
"When there are more than 50 amendments, Rule 130a of our Rules of Procedure gives the President the right to request that the committee meet to consider the matter."
"We believe, then, that this would be the correct procedure if we are to operate democratically and openly. Given the number of amendments tabled, we should discuss the matter again in committee."
"We could then vote on the report during the July part-session."
"We cannot understand why we are due to work under the conditions anticipated for this evening and tomorrow. They are difficult for us to accept."
"Mr Ribeiro e Castro, in principle, we will do what we can this evening to ensure that no difficult situation arises and I will raise this issue with Parliament's President."
"We will adhere to the Rules of Procedure, but today we shall interpret them in such a way that the debate can go ahead as well as any relevant resolutions, if appropriate."
"We take very good note of Mr Ribeiro e Castro's words."
"On behalf of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio has the floor."
". (ES) Mr President, the aim of this proposal is to implement once and for all the aims set out in Amsterdam in Article 191 of the Treaty on European Union."
"This article was supplemented by the Treaty of Nice when the latter added a legal basis for adopting the necessary legislative measures through the codecision procedure and qualified majority voting."
"Political parties at European level are an important part of the democratic structure of the Union."
"They are a factor for integration."
"They contribute to forming a European awareness, to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union and to promoting political debate at European level."
"To be able to do this they must have resources."
"It is therefore appropriate and necessary that they should be helped to carry out the tasks conferred on them by the Treaty and that they should consequently receive at least partial financing from the Community budgets."
"The Regulation seeks to establish a solid and transparent legislative framework for the recognition and financing of European political parties."
"We are not starting from scratch, ladies and gentlemen; this new proposal is based on the constructive work undertaken by Parliament and the Council in 2001, particularly during the Belgian Presidency."
"I wish, in this regard, to congratulate Mrs Schleicher, who served as rapporteur at the time."
"We have taken advantage of the new opportunities provided by majority voting in comparison to the 2001compromise to propose higher thresholds for obtaining financing."
"Our basic proposal has sought to avoid political requirements that are too restrictive for European political parties for two main reasons: firstly, we want an open and plural system in which all shades of opinion can be represented in the European debate; secondly, if things were done otherwise, the debate in Council and in Parliament would be drawn out unnecessarily, perhaps even beyond the 2004 European elections."
"All three institutions agree that a European political party that wishes to be recognised as such and to obtain financing from the Community budget must fulfil certain minimum conditions."
"We have sought to establish conditions that are not too restrictive but which are coherent and fundamental."
"Parties must be representative, must have a statute and aims, they must prove their intention to stand in European elections, they must have clear rules for their financial management and above all respect the democratic principles established in Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"At the same time, there must be a reliable verification system."
"Parliament must be able to verify whether all of these conditions are met before registering a party."
"Furthermore, there is a special verification procedure for cases in which a minority in Parliament rejects the initial decision."
"In order to receive financing, we propose that the parties have representatives elected at European, national and regional level in one third of the Union's States, because these are supposed to be European parties and this is the European arena and, therefore, the arena that needs to be boosted."
"In line with Declaration No 11 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Commission proposal prohibits the cross-financing of national political parties."
"It also prohibits political groups from raising financing by providing services, unless these are paid for in a verifiable and documented way, in other words, through bills."
"Article 8 sets out strict control and auditing measures to strengthen the transparency and legitimacy of the system; we consider that parties should not depend completely on public financing and we therefore propose that they should raise at least 25% of their budget themselves."
"We have made a balanced proposal on the controversial issue of donations in line with the 2001 compromise and consequently propose that donations should be permitted, although only if they satisfy strict conditions of transparency."
"To conclude, Mr President, I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved, on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament, in which the Commission played a part and which should, we hope, enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading."
"I congratulate Mr Leinen and the Presidency, and on behalf of the Commission I wish to express our full acceptance of and support for this compromise, which we consider to be appropriate and which will meet the needs of the various players involved in this complex matter."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mrs de Palacio that, without European parties, there will be no European democracy."
"That is why it is vitally important that this House should, tomorrow, approve this act on the statute and financing of European political parties, for then, as soon as this summer, something that is, in particular, a corner-stone of greater transparency in European politics can become effective, and the parties will have enough time, between now and the elections in June 2004, to adjust themselves to the new arrangements that this law makes necessary."
"By adopting this act tomorrow, Parliament will also be honouring a promise, made to the Court of Auditors, that it would, within the life of this Parliament, submit a new basis for the financing of European political work and put an end to the cross-subsidisation of party work via this House and the political groups within it."
"The fact is that, in all our countries, the functions of parties and parliaments are kept separate, and this law will give us the opportunity to both distinguish between the different functions and roles of parties on the one hand and parliamentary groups on the other, and also to make them a reality, at EU level as is the case elsewhere, by means of the new basis on which they are funded."
"Thanks are due to the political groups for having, so to speak, acted as midwives at the birth of the European political parties."
"Without them, there would have been nobody capable of funding them."
"The draft now before you is something we regard as an acceptable compromise."
"It complies with the conditions imposed by the majority on the committee, and minor changes have been made to it."
"There are compromise motions that we are putting forward, which we can vote on tomorrow, and indeed we are meant to."
"The reduction of the threshold for a European political party's representation in the European Parliament from one third to one quarter of the Member States enables smaller political parties to participate in this system of financing."
"One quarter is, however, a necessary threshold even if we want to prevent the fragmentation of the party political landscape while taking into account the fact that we are also incorporating the regional parliaments and also the regional assemblies into the system."
"I believe that one quarter makes for a sensible compromise on which to agree."
"Donations to political parties differ widely from one country to another and are another sensitive and highly controversial issue."
"The draft act has, I believe, come down decisively on one side of the line."
"Donations to the European political parties are to be made as transparent as possible."
"We have compromised on a ceiling of EUR 12 000 per annum for each donor; although some find it too high, and others too low, no political party can be bought for EUR 12 000."
"It is my belief that support must also be given if political work is fostered by society rather than only by the State - that is right and proper, provided that transparency exists and controls are in place."
"The way is now open for the European political parties to expand their activities in the run-up to the European elections."
"There had at first been some doubts about this, and those who jeopardise this are also putting in question the reason and purpose for European political parties' existence."
"I believe that this document makes proper provision for such matters, and it will be important even after the draft Constitution has been produced, as the European Parliament of the future is to elect the President of the Commission."
"The parties will of course be very important in this regard."
"Let me also point out that there is a fly in the ointment."
"This statute does not yet confer European legal personality, but the financing sees us taking the first step, with the second step, in the form of an actual European statute, perhaps yet to come."
"I have always maintained that the European law on political parties must be to politics what the European Company is to business."
"We will get back to the subject when Parliament draws up a report in two years' time."
"I also have to thank the Commission for having come up with the proposal, and Mrs de Palacio and Mr Fitzmaurice many times over for their constant active involvement."
"I congratulate the Greek Presidency of the Council and all the governments who were ready to accept this compromise; Mr Nikos Matthioudakis was my constant partner in the truest sense of the word, and he and I were able to hammer out this compromise together."
"Let me also thank my fellow-Members: Mr Dimitri Tsatsos, whose report many years ago laid the foundations for this whole topic;"
"Tomorrow, we can vote in favour."
"I hope that we will."
"We will then have taken an important step for political work at EU level, and thus also for European democracy."
"Thank you, all those who have helped in this!"
". (DE) Mr President, this Statute is important, and it must not be allowed to go under."
"That is one reason why I am sure that by far most of our committee can live with the fact that this compromise takes no account of a number of our important points; this is, though, a parliament and not a meeting of diplomats, and that is why a certain number of things remain to be said."
"In the committee, we favoured putting the financing of European political parties under the Commission's budget rather than Parliament's."
"In this afternoon's debate in this Chamber on the outcome of the Convention, Mr Hänsch told us: 'The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century.'"
"We have to remind ourselves of this when discussing the question: what about the requirement that parties be independent of the state?"
"If we take that as being fundamental, we may well get different answers to that question at European and at national level."
"It may be that the reasoning underlying the imperative that states should be at arms' length from political parties and their financial arrangements, is best satisfied if, at European level, they are linked to the Commission rather than to Parliament."
"Our committee was in favour of incorporating tougher sanctions in the event of political parties failing to comply with the requirements of financial transparency."
"We wanted the money not merely to be repaid; we wanted it to repay twice the amount."
"If there is not to be too great a temptation to do this, then sanctions must really hurt."
"That is why it is regrettable that it was not possible to negotiate this with the Council."
"There are two further comments I would like to make on the questions that have cropped up."
"The way the Commission said that the doubling of the amount was not on, because there was no provision for it in the Financial Regulation, reminded me of encounters with people who say such things as, 'that is how we have always done it', 'we have never done it like that before', and 'who knows what would come of it?'"
"Those are the sort of archetypal experiences that you get with bureaucracies."
"Or what was said on the subject of the question raised in the original draft, to the effect that 'you in the political parties can do anything except fund election campaigns'; if that was the line taken over a long period of time by the national governments and the Commission, then that is another reason why the bureaucracies of the Council and the Commission were known and feared throughout Europe for their capacity for innovation, and I think we should not forget that, when it comes to taking decisions, a bit more awareness of real life would do us all some good."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if, tomorrow, we adopt this compromise in the form in which the political groups have joined in presenting it, we will have reached the end of a never-ending story, and it is to be hoped that the ending we will give it will be a happy one."
"It is in fact Parliament that is the heart of the European parties, for it was in Parliament that the need arose to develop commonalities within Europe, and, if you bear in mind that 133 political parties are represented today in this House, united in seven political families, that alone shows how there are no limits to the work done for Europe, in this House, by the political groups, which, in the European Parliament, bring together the states whose political parties are elected to the European Parliament."
"That is, in itself, unbelievably laborious work, and I believe that we sometimes undervalue it."
"Why has this been a never-ending story?"
"It was Mr Tsatsos - and let me say that I believe this has been his life's work - who produced the first report to this House aimed at fostering awareness of how necessary European political parties are."
"Then we had Amsterdam, which made it possible to get an initiative going, but, as the Council at that time was unable to come to an agreement, Parliament's report was left high and dry in the Council."
"I would now like to extend warm thanks to the Commission."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February this year, the Commission presented a proposal in the shortest conceivable time; now that we have considered it, I can tell you that they made a very quick job of it."
"The end result has been that we have not only considered it, but will - it is to be hoped - be finalising it tomorrow."
"I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his considerable efforts, and I can say on behalf of all of us that, even though we have not got everything we wanted, we still want a solution, and, as I see it, we need one in view of the fact that the Court of Auditors has ended up presenting us with the prospect of having, at the end of this year, to abandon the current practice, which gives the parties stability, and if we do not find a solution, we will then be facing oblivion."
"That is why, yet again, I would like to ask all those among you who still have doubts, to lend a hand in the completion of a work and in finding an eventual solution, one that is clear and open to scrutiny and, therefore, one that has to work."
"I would therefore like to thank not only Mr Leinen, but also the Greek Presidency of the Council, which, with all the work it has to do - and there are many other matters to deal with -made a real effort and did everything possible to get the Council to come up with a joint resolution."
"I do think that we in this House should not only express our appreciation of this, but should also say that it is because everyone has done their bit that we are now coming to a conclusion."
"In every democratic state the world over, this political order, which secures for the people freedom and co-determination, is founded upon political parties and guaranteed by them."
"We simply have to see that, as the European Economic Community developed and expanded into the European Union, it was therefore hardly surprising that European political parties should undergo a parallel development."
"It is for that reason that I am appealing to all those who may perhaps still harbour doubts to play their part in helping us, tomorrow, to achieve a result that will lay a foundation, one on the basis of which political parties can be funded, one that will make the future continuation of this work possible."
"So, again, I thank all those involved and all those who will, tomorrow, help us to achieve this outcome."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying immediately on behalf of my Group that we accept the compromise that has been so skilfully negotiated between the rapporteur, the Greek Presidency and the Commission on this text."
"I would like to congratulate those involved on having worked so hard to make it possible for us to reach a first reading agreement so that this legislation can be adopted in good time before the next European elections."
"I would like to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur, Jo Leinen, in this respect, and indeed to all those who came before him in preparing the way, notably Professor Tsatsos in his report a number of years ago."
"This is an exercise in transparency, no more, no less."
"It puts on a clear and transparent footing the method by which the Union will finance trans-national European political parties."
"Up to now it has been done indirectly via the political groups in the European Parliament, henceforth it will be done directly according to clear criteria and clear procedures set out in this legislation."
"That is why we welcome it."
"My group also accepts the various compromises that have been made as regards the detail."
"Frankly, we would have preferred a higher threshold in Article 3, as regards the representativity of European political parties, but we are happy to accept, in the spirit of compromise that is necessary in the European Union, that this somewhat lower threshold will apply."
"We are particularly pleased that the issue of donations has been settled, and that a clear, transparent and limited system where any donation to a political party is limited in level and also has to be registered on a register is laid down in the text."
"There are a few strange little things in the text where I think the lawyer-linguists need to look at some of the translation versions."
"It is not a matter of amending the text formally in the plenary, but when the toilettage of the text is done I would like them to look notably at Article 5(2), where the English version specifies that Parliament verifies that a party meets the necessary conditions by a majority of its Members."
"Is that a majority of Members needing to accept that a party meets the conditions, or a majority of Members needing to challenge that a party no longer meets the necessary conditions?"
"The text in the English version is not clear and it would be useful if that were tidied up when the translations are verified."
"Similarly, that Article makes no mention - it may just be a typing error - of the verification of Article 3d."
"It mentions 3a, 3b and 3c, but 3d seems to be missing."
"No doubt this can easily be corrected."
"Finally, on Article 6, point (c), the fourth and last indent in the English version reads as if it almost contradicts the previous indent."
"I think it is clear what the intention was in drafting it this way, but it has not been very well rendered in the English language version and it would be useful to correct it."
"Those conclude my comments on behalf of the PSE Group."
"Mr President, I had no idea that I had that effect on microphones!"
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work."
"I would also like to congratulate the Council for having finally seen sense, assisted, it must be said, by the introduction of qualified majority voting."
"There are great lessons there for us in the Convention and in the IGC."
"The Council has finally moved to a common position which the large majority of Liberals are able to accept fully."
"The first draft sought - absurdly - to outlaw political party campaigning with public money."
"What on earth are political parties for if they are not for campaigning?"
"The new draft, however, has corrected this and is allowing sufficient possibility for political parties to receive modest private donations."
"The question of the threshold is settled quite reasonably in favour of small political movements with real and serious European objectives."
"Certain other officious bureaucratic provisions have been removed."
"This is good news for parliamentary democracy in Europe."
"Trans-national political parties are a vital sinew of democracy, articulating the anxieties and the aspirations of the citizen on a European scale."
"The constitutionalisation process in which the Union is presently involved requires the engagement of mature European political parties."
"This report is a breakthrough and should be supported by all those who wish this institution well and who subscribe to the principles of transparency and accountability."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you will be aware that there are, within my political group, differences of opinion and diverse views on the purpose of European political parties, and of the rationale behind them."
"I am, myself, in favour of them."
"I am convinced that, as integration continues to progress, they will be able to help our continent to continue to grow together and also help, progressively, to foster European awareness in every Member State."
"That is why I also think it a good thing that this overriding idea should be incorporated in the Convention's draft for the Constitution, where it is enshrined in law in Article 45(4) in the section on 'Democratic Life in the European Union'."
"I wish to add my gratitude to that expressed by Members of this House to the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, to the Greek Presidency of the Council and also to the Commission, for enabling an acceptable compromise to be worked out yesterday."
"I see this as being very important in terms of this House's political credibility."
"As those who spoke before me have pointed out, this problem has been pursuing us for a long time, and it must now be sorted out once and for all, as it is, above all, in the public's interest that there should be nothing that the Court of Auditors might criticise in future."
"It is for that reason that I support the text of the regulation."
"In particular, the provisions in Article 3 on the 3% threshold and on the parties being represented in at least one quarter of the Member States are really important, especially to the smaller political parties."
"Commissioner De Palacio is of course quite right to say that it is an absolute requirement that the regulation should take political pluralism into account."
"I regard the proposed rules on donations as clear and unambiguous."
"Above all, they safeguard the transparency of party finances, which is indispensable and - as you will be aware - a sensitive point, perhaps the most sensitive of all."
"This House should, in my view, speak out in favour of all information relating to donations being accessible to the public at any time."
"It would be for the best if, when the regulation takes effect, the political parties themselves were to undertake to post on the Internet all data relating to income from donations."
"With this in mind, I wish to express my endorsement of this proposal for a regulation."
"Mr President, I represent as you say, a composite group in this, the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance, and I would like to thank personally Jo Leinen very much for his colleaguely courtesy and goodwill in carrying out this work."
"Undoubtedly, unlike Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I think that what has been produced is a genuine attempt at a compromise and one which I believe a majority of my Group will be happy to accept, although other colleagues who will speak in the debate will draw attention to particular points of concern."
"From the point of view of the European Free Alliance which I particularly represent here, there are, however, genuine concerns about the way in which the criteria are chosen: the way in which one specifies what counts."
"Currently in this Parliament, the European Free Alliance represents a wide range of what we would think of as distinct countries within the European Union - Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Flanders, Galicia, Scotland and Wales, to take them in alphabetical order in the English language - but of course, from the point of view of a criterion based upon States, that is only three States."
"When I look at the new flags beautifully adorning the podium there, I see that there are flags of many countries which are present or future Member States and which are actually, in terms of either territory or population or both, considerably smaller than the countries I have mentioned."
"So the kind of movement in thought - and it is a European movement in thought - which the European Free Alliance represents is actively discriminated against by a criterion specified simply in terms of a proportion of the total number of Member States."
"That really is something that needs to be reflected upon."
"A Parliament of this kind and a Union of this kind must have a very particular regard for the interests of minorities and for fairness to minorities and the rights of smaller groups."
"I know that the compromise has aimed to move in our direction and I appreciate that very much, but the fact of the matter is that there is still a serious difficulty from the point of view of this genuine European tide of opinion."
"The European Free Alliance has been recognised for a long time as one of the original Europe-wide political families, and yet we will stand on the margins of being excluded and de-recognised under these proposals."
"I am afraid we cannot support them in this form."
"Mr President, the supranational political parties are artificial products that are in no position to collect voluntary contributions from ordinary people."
"They must, therefore, instead receive contributions from big business and trade unions and be able to dip into EU funds."
"Those who are to use the money can themselves decide how much they want."
"Under the new constitution, 13 countries will be able to vote down 12."
"The large parties will be able to use their majorities to prohibit subsidies for the smaller parties."
"They can also declare parties supported by the electorate to be un-European and take their subsidies."
"The Council meeting also removed a ban on involvement in national elections."
"The supranational parties can thus turn the national parties into their compliant subsidiaries."
"The proposal has totalitarian features."
"Let us put together a coalition to bring the matter before the Court of Justice."
"The proposal before us contravenes the principle of equality. In my opinion, the legislation is unlawful and should therefore be tested by the Court of Justice."
"For example, it is impossible for national minorities to obtain subsidies, even if they carry on appropriately cross-border activities."
"This makes matters impossible for new movements and parties, and difficult for others."
"There is a lack of equality across the board, and there needs to be such equality, in accordance with my own constitution, the existing treaties and the draft constitution that is now on the way."
"They all contain a principle of equality that also applies to this proposal."
"Mr President, as I said in my minority opinion attached to the Leinen report, the action of political parties at European level ought to be fed from the base, that is by the national political parties and the citizens, and not from the top by the European institutions."
"That is the first condition for encouraging a living democracy instead of creating an artificial democracy from scratch."
"The second condition would be to reject the idea of a statute for political parties, which was introduced by the Treaty of Nice; it seems to have more to do with bureaucracy than with a free society."
"Apart from this objection of principle, we also have a strong objection concerning the details, because the Commission's proposal does not seem to us to be in conformity with the treaties."
"It wants in fact to finance European political parties, whereas the treaty uses a much broader expression, 'political parties at European level', which includes action at European level by national political parties."
"In our opinion, that constitutes real discrimination."
"Finally, Mr President, I support Mr Ribeiro e Castro's request that this text be referred back to the committee pursuant to Rule 130a of the Rules of Procedure, since 75 amendments have been tabled, which is far more than the limit of 50."
"I have heard Mr Leinen's reply that some of those amendments are compromise amendments, but that concept does not in fact exist in the Rules of Procedure."
"Whether they are simple or compromise amendments, the text must be referred back to the committee if there are more than 50 amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, ladies and gentlemen, last week - last Friday - the Convention, with the consent of the representatives of the governments and national parliaments of 28 countries, of the European Parliament and of the Commission, adopted the draft constitution for the EU."
"Many of us see this as having been an historic day."
"This draft, which brought the Convention's labours to an end, is meant to make Europe more transparent, efficient and democratic, and to bring it closer to the people."
"In our own time, parliamentary democracy is characterised by political parties campaigning in elections and by parliamentary deputies - nominated by these parties and directly elected by the citizens - joining together in political groups in the parliaments."
"The Convention is strengthening the European Parliament by extending the codecision procedure, conferring upon Parliament full budgetary powers and giving it the right to elect the President of the Commission after the results of the elections to the European Parliament have been taken into account."
"Although we have spent the past few days applauding that this is so, and rejoicing that we have at last reached our destination, we have had, to date, no legally binding statute for Members of the European Parliament, because the Council is blocking it."
"Up to now, there has been no regulation on the legal status and financing of European political parties."
"We have no uniform right to vote."
"There are no European lists on which we can vote for candidates."
"Parliament's adoption, during the last part-session in Strasbourg, of a Statute for its Members, closed a loophole."
"When, as I hope we will do tomorrow, we adopt the resolution on the legal status of European political parties - and especially following the Council's decision on Monday, which we very much welcome - we will be closing a second loophole in democratic politics."
"My group supports the document before us and the compromise motions, having vigorously campaigned to get this loophole in democratic politics closed."
"In doing so, we have done what Amsterdam and Nice have required of us."
"We are fulfilling our promise to the Court of Auditors by putting a stop to cross-subsidies between groups and parties, where such a thing still exists."
"By doing this, we are creating greater transparency, openness and clarity in political work and in the way in which political parties' activities are funded."
"By doing this, we are helping to make the national political parties more European and the work at European level more democratic."
"We are, then, creating the conditions for European lists and for a uniform European right to vote."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is glad that a distinction has been drawn between the work of the Groups in this House and that of the political parties, as also between the functions of national parties and the work of European ones."
"We rejoice at the clear demarcation between European election campaigns and those in the nation-states."
"We welcome the clear rules on what donors can do."
"We welcome the clear qualitative and quantitative criteria and the requirement for democratic legitimacy, both of which must be provided for and complied with if a party is to have European status."
"This does not amount to discrimination against small groups, for a party is European only if it operates not only at national level, but also in a specified number of Member States in which it enjoys democratic legitimacy and has partners."
"This leads me to ask you all, tomorrow, to close the continuing loophole in democratic politics and thereby to ensure greater transparency and clarity."
"Mr President, I warmly recommend voting in favour of the excellent Leinen report."
"In his report, Mr Leinen explores the history of the institution of political parties."
"We owe him our thanks."
"With this proposal for a vote in favour tomorrow, the European political parties will acquire a legal basis and will strengthen the democratic character of the European Union."
"Again, my warmest thanks to Mr Leinen, as well as to Mrs Schleicher and Mr Corbett for their courteous reference to my somewhat older contributions."
"I will not conceal my personal satisfaction."
"I must also praise the work carried out by Mrs Schleicher during the previous stage."
"The European Parliament should be satisfied with the Council of Ministers' wording on both the questions at issue, both on the minimum number of Member States in which the party is active and on the sensitive issue of funding."
"Besides, the compromise amendments submitted resolve any problems there may be."
"The democratic benefits of giving European political parties a legal status are many."
"I would refer to the following: there will be a deepening of the legitimacy of the European institutions."
"Giving the European political parties a legal status is a valuable complement to the constitutionalisation of the Treaties."
"In the field of the European political parties, the principle of solidarity between peoples at social level will be implemented via the substantial political rally of the national parties of the Member States."
"The role of the European citizen will no longer finish when he votes in elections to the European Parliament; it will extend to his mobilisation within the framework of the European political parties."
"The European citizen will turn from a citizen into an active citizen."
"On the question of funding, it brings transparency and protection of the party institution from unknown or questionable financial sources."
"Only with the institution of the European political parties can the process of unification in Europe finally become our affair, by which I mean the affair of the European citizens."
"I would like to finish by congratulating the Greek Presidency, the excellent diplomats Messrs Mathioudakis and Venizelos, and also by informing the House of the personal interest of President Kostas Simitis who, both as a politician and as a specialist, had paid a great deal of attention to the institution of political parties."
"It was his particular wish to be able to count this law among the successes and work of the Greek Presidency."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that I am in favour of simple, clear, transparent ground rules for the political groups in the European Parliament."
"I am, however, opposed on principle to the use of taxpayers' money for political parties."
"It is quite simply a question of whether parties are to be supported by public funds or by members of the individual parties."
"I believe they should be supported by the latter."
"In this matter, it is not the people, or the electorate, that have created a need for publicly financed political parties."
"The need that has arisen in this case has been created by professional politicians, and that is, as I see it, an artificial need."
"For what is a European party?"
"For the individual taxpayer, it exists solely on paper and is a mere mirage, devoid of substance."
"In financial terms, there are no large amounts involved - as yet."
"This is the thin end of the wedge, however."
"I anticipate the aid increasing all the time, and it would grow at a rate in excess of the general rate of inflation."
"I also think a question mark can be placed over the democratic element in this proposal."
"The principle must be that, if we absolutely must give taxpayers' money to European parties, all parties should be given it, and that would not be the case under the proposal."
"I am in favour of clear transparent rules, but I am not in favour of aid for European parties, and that is why I also reject this proposal."
"Mr President, the large groups in this House must be feeling like the cat that got the cream, for there will now be millions pouring into their party coffers, and they will be able to afford fun and games throughout Europe."
"The result of our debates is, then, that the taxpayer will have to finance and pay for all manner of banquets held by European political parties."
"It is annoying, but there is no altering matters."
"It is therefore our most important task to ensure that the aid is transparent."
"It needs to be possible for any citizen to check all donations to the parties on the Internet and, in the same way, the European parties' accounts must be accessible to anyone curious about them."
"Matters are not very satisfactory at present. For example, the accounts of the three big political parties are closed and opaque affairs."
"This is something we need, of course, to sort out, and I should therefore like to call for detailed monitoring of, and clear rules governing, what the money is used for."
"Allow me therefore to call upon everyone to take a look at the parties' accounts in order to see whether they can in actual fact deduce anything from them."
"I can tell you now that they will not be able to."
"All they will be able to do is hope that party members will have had some really good junkets and beanfeasts around Europe at the taxpayers' expense."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by showing you these: empty envelopes."
"I will explain why when I have finished what I have to say."
"I would also like to congratulate my friend Mr Jo Leinen on the quality of his work."
"It is almost faultless."
"He was right to draw attention to the importance of European parties, which are a vital structural tool in our continental debate."
"I think the representativeness threshold is right, with the reference to regional parliaments and setting a 3% threshold for European elections."
"The clause on checking conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights also seems a good one to me."
"On the other hand, I am still waiting for just one fellow Member to explain to me why a company would spontaneously give money to a political party."
"It seems to me that when you have to render account to shareholders and you give money, it is in return for a service."
"It also seems to me, as a mere democrat, that when an elected representative receives money for a service to be rendered, that is called corruption."
"Then people say to me: yes, but it will be transparent."
"I am not sure that transparency in corruption is a great step forward."
"They also tell me it will be very, very little money, the amounts will be tiny."
"If they will be so very small, why not none at all?"
"If it is as little as that, let us do without that little and let us not prime the pump."
"Especially since the pump will be directed essentially at the parties in power, who will be able to return the favour."
"It will then be even easier for them to hold on to power because they will have money."
"They will be able to render more services and then we will be back where we started."
"This brings me back to my envelopes."
"Like those I have in my hand, the envelopes will multiply, fill with money and circulate, because it will be so easy to break amounts down to avoid all the ceilings and evade all the transparencies."
"I therefore give you due warning this evening: a day will come, ladies and gentlemen, when the newspaper headlines and the courts will be full of scandals involving the hidden financing of European political parties."
"I know that democracy, which serves the public sphere, has a cost, but that cost must be borne by the public sphere and by it alone."
"Mr President, accepting for a moment the rapporteur's central premise that political parties play a central role in contemporary democracy, the role played by them is on a national stage, even MEPs belong to national parties, and they represent their national electorates."
"On the other hand, European political parties simply do not exist in any coherent form except in the minds of enthusiastic integrationists."
"The proposed European Union Constitution prohibits 'any discrimination based on any grounds such as sex, race, colour, political or any other opinion'."
"It also says that political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union."
"Two recent opinion polls in the UK gave figures of 92% and 96% as wanting to leave the European Union, and yet this proposal would deny funding to any party who should dare to represent the views of that very large proportion of its citizens."
"It therefore goes against not only the spirit but the very letter of your Constitution."
"It does not promote democracy, it reduces it."
"With this proposal, you are travelling down a very slippery slope."
"Mr President, much as I respect Mr Leinen, I have rarely seen such a lousy draft as the one about European political parties."
"Moreover, it is not by chance that this debate is taking place at 10 p.m. and in secret."
"EUR 8 million are being shared out among us and it is clearly being done with the utmost discretion."
"Sharing among us is of course a manner of speaking."
"There are about 20 Members present and at least six or seven of those 20 Members are not destined to get any."
"It is not clear why."
"We are all Members of the European Parliament, we have all been elected, but we are not worthy of this party funding."
"Mr Karas has presented a democratic argument in favour of this great European project and it is a pity that the party he belongs to in his country will not get that money."
"Perhaps you know that, Mr Karas."
"Is that democracy?"
"They are elected representatives and they are denied the means of survival."
"But they exist, Mr Karas, they are even your allies at Austrian level, but at European level they do not exist, they have no right to funding."
"This Leinen report and the consequences that flow from it are quite bizarre."
"What is more, we are discussing it in secret."
"That being the case, my dear Mr Onesta, where are these European political parties?"
"Do you know them?"
"Can anyone join one of these European political parties we are talking about?"
"In my country, I can join my national parties, you can join your national parties, the French Greens."
"We can join the trans-national radical party, and some Members have done so, but we cannot join these so-called European political parties that are going to receive a pile of cash for what are really meetings of amalgamations of European political parties."
"We saw clearly enough, during the Gulf crisis, for example, how these European political parties behaved."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists, I take my hat off to you!"
"Bravo for your united stance on the Gulf!"
"The same goes for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Is there a single activist in these parties?"
"That is still all very unsound, ladies and gentlemen."
"I do not mind a bit of an effort being made to bail out the confederations of parties, but in the light of the European ideal it is not very fair, not very worthy."
"Incidentally, together with other colleagues from parties which - for reasons unknown - will not be getting any money, even though they are represented in Parliament, defend ideas here, are elected by millions of people, we intend bringing an action before the Court of Justice and we will see who wins!"
"I will end with a final word to Mr Leinen."
"You were very passionate in insisting that it should be the Commission that manages this money, that a directorate general should look after the parties' statute."
"The Council said niet, and it seems you have tabled an amendment with the result that we no longer know who is going to give the money to the European political parties you are so fond of."
"It is not Parliament and it is not the Commission."
"Your compromise amendment is somewhat bizarre."
"I wonder who will give the money?"
"Perhaps the Court of Justice when we bring our action and perhaps we will also claim damages."
"I am joking when I say that, but I also want you to know that the battle is not over."
"I think this report is seriously flawed and does merit recourse to the Court of Justice, and we will see then whether we are right to say, regardless of the contents, that it is quite wrong to propose financing two thirds or three quarters of this Chamber while disregarding the other third or quarter."
"Thank you very much, Mr Dell'Alba."
"I would simply say to you that although this is a late hour, there is nothing secretive about it."
"This late hour receives all the publicity available to Parliament, through all of its mechanisms."
"Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that the British Conservatives will be voting against this proposal tomorrow."
"We think it is wrong in principle to take people's money through taxation in order to synthesise an artificial sense of European identity."
"Many of my constituents, and, I dare say, even some of the constituents of the honourable Members who will be voting for the resolution tomorrow, would be horrified to learn that their taxes were subsidising European political parties whose programmes they might fundamentally oppose."
"Furthermore, we believe that the bill introduces a dangerous principle of political discrimination."
"It discriminates overtly against some parties on the basis of their beliefs and covertly against all parties which see themselves principally in national terms and are accordingly reluctant to form trans-European blocks."
"So much, perhaps, will not surprise you."
"I accept that the British Conservative Party is in a minority in this Chamber in championing the primacy of national democracy."
"I know that most Members of this House believe that a working democracy at European Union level is feasible and desirable: that is a perfectly honourable position, but I would appeal to such Members to ask themselves whether these proposals are truly democratic."
"In a pure democracy there should be as few restrictions as possible on how people choose their representatives."
"Having been elected, politicians should be free to associate in any combinations they wish."
"They should be able to express their opinions openly and they should be allowed to raise funds through any method that their voters will tolerate."
"Laying down legal criteria for recognition dilutes democracy and infantilises the voter."
"If a politician expresses noxious views, it should be up to his constituents to remove him, not the courts, let alone his political opponents."
"If he is thought to be financially dependent on some vested interest, then that too should be a matter for his voters, not the authorities."
"The bill before the House tonight traduces these principles."
"It goes so far as to introduce a mechanism where parties which are at odds with the political convictions of the majority may be disqualified, a measure surely more in keeping with the old Warsaw Pact than with the democratic Europe to which we are notionally devoted."
"In a free political market place, good ideas will triumph, not because bad ones are suppressed, but because people are able to distinguish between truth and falsehood."
"If our constituents are not able to make that choice for themselves, their moral capacity is diminished and a measure of their freedom is lost."
"Democracy is not just a slogan, a trite word to attach to any idea of which we happen to approve."
"It has a very specific meaning and it is incompatible with the measure before us tonight."
"True Europeans, honest democrats and sincere lovers of freedom should vote against it."
"Mr President, after the Council's failure to achieve unanimity in 2001, new perspectives opened up at Nice. A new legal basis was created and qualified majority voting came into force."
"This is the background to our current debate on the new proposal for a Regulation."
"This proposal does in fact signal some progress in Europe, but I cannot forbear registering my disapproval - consternation, even - on noticing that the recognition of European political parties as legal persons has not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, we have only just reached the stage of dealing with their funding ?"
"These are the reasons why this report, and the perseverance and tenacity it reveals on the part of the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, has earned my full support for the clarity and even-handedness with which the original proposal is explored."
"I am referring particularly to the report's discussion of recognition of the parties' legal personality, clarification of the scale of the resources available to them, and openness regarding their Community funding, which should be subject to normal audit inspections. The report holds the Commission responsible for administering financial resources, relieving the European Parliament of that burden in order to avoid giving rise to unnecessary suspicions."
"Unlike the proposed Regulation, the report permits European political parties to use their funds to subsidise the activities of national parties and conduct European election campaigns."
"The approval of this Regulation will be the first great achievement of the institutional framework on which European democracy rests."
"It paves the way for the urgent completion of the Statute for Members and the essential uniform electoral law for the European Parliament."
"I hope that the institutions involved in the legislative process will now assume responsibility for their actions."
"Mr President, a statute for European political parties, with transparency of financing as its principal theme, is urgent and essential."
"Mr President, it is a little odd, for it sometimes sounds as if it is a question of being either for or against European parties."
"I think that is absolute nonsense, because we are at present in a situation in which we have no financial aid for European parties and yet we do in actual fact have European parties."
"It is not up to the Commission or the Council or the European Parliament whether or not we are to have European parties."
"It is up to those who are politically active in Europe."
"It is, moreover, up to the people of Europe whether we are to have European parties."
"Now, we are talking about whether they are to be given money into the bargain."
"I think that the view being taken, namely the belief that a European democracy or a European public can be brought about through European parties, is quite wrong in a democratic perspective."
"In my view, it is the other way around."
"The presence of European democracy and a European public gives rise to European parties."
"It is the 'bottom-up', rather than the 'top-down', mentality we should be adopting in this case."
"This proposal is unfortunately an expression of the 'top-down' mentality, and I shall not support it."
"Mr President, some of the previous speakers have pointed out that, without parties, there is no democracy, and to that I have to add that there is no democracy without gender equality."
"We know that women are still very much under-represented, even though they make up half of Europe's population."
"If women are not adequately represented in political life, this also shows how little progress the political parties have made as regards gender equality."
"The political parties now have the task of making the principle of equality a political reality, and parties funded with European money also have the task of representing the public in an appropriate way."
"We therefore want the Statute on European political parties to make the allocation of funds conditional upon a balanced male/female ratio."
"The parity that we are proposing should be an obvious thing, and it is indeed regarded as such in a number of Member States, France being an example."
"The French National Assembly unanimously adopted a law on parity."
"We should not merely be paying lip-service by stressing how important equality is."
"Today, we have again made this clear in the Convention, where equality of treatment has been set down, once and for all, as a fundamental value."
"Nor must we merely appeal to the business world and demand that it should refrain from discrimination, if we ourselves are not willing to do so."
"That would lose us our credibility."
"I therefore appeal to you to adopt our proposals as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Leinen for his efforts."
"Even though I would endorse the report in the light of the undeniable need for the European dimension of political parties at the very moment the Convention is launching the Constitutional draft for the European Union, the system actually proposed can hardly hide the inner tendency to transfer the American way of doing politics to the European landscape."
"It is more than evident that even the most acute analysts cannot distinguish the main differences between Democrats and Republicans, as is highlighted by issues such as the recent occupation of Iraq."
"The proposal we are dealing with shows a clear will on the part of the European Union's lobbies to abandon the historical European arena and to embrace political confrontation in its stead, following the American model."
"The financing scheme leaves no doubt about it."
"Furthermore, we should not ignore the fact that the proposed rules discriminate against political parties of its stateless nations, such as the Basque Country, as Mr MacCormick mentioned just a few minutes ago."
"Moreover, if amendments such as that proposed by Mr Gil-Robles go through, the question remains: has he asked for respect for the laws of the Member State in which those parties operate?"
"Certainly, Spanish nationalists have no limits."
"Mr President, Mr Churchill, who I think was a Conservative, indicated on more than one occasion that he thought the democratic system was not great, but it was the best that we had and we had to defend it and protect it and, indeed, we have to regulate it."
"There is no doubt that all the evidence of history indicates that we have to regulate the funding of political parties."
"There is no other way of ensuring that parties are not corrupted."
"We have far too many examples right across Europe of private money corrupting politics and the regulators."
"A lot of people, certainly in my own country, are shocked that some of the money they have paid for buying a house has been used to corrupt the planning laws."
"They will be quite happy to have their tax money used to ensure that the political system remains uncorrupted or becomes corruption-free."
"There have been a lot of spurious arguments here tonight, particularly about thresholds for receiving funding."
"I am not aware of a single Member State in the European Union that does not have a regulation with regard to thresholds for the funding of political parties."
"Indeed, there are thresholds for getting elected to Parliament, never mind getting money for political parties."
"The Statute we are dealing with, taken together with the Statute of Members of Parliament and with the very positive outcome of the Convention, indicates a coming-of-age for the European Union."
"I hope that the summit this week takes its courage in its hands, approves this Statute and approves the outcome of the Convention."
"We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demos, a real public space for the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, the rapporteur is dreaming of a uniform electoral system with transnational lists and, for that, he requires European parties."
"Funds from European taxpayers are deployed to accelerate and facilitate the setting up of such parties."
"This makes those parties particularly artificial."
"The raison d'être is not the common goals and activities of the associated members, but the need for a state administration at European level."
"My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, is quite happy to work with like-minded Left Socialists in other countries, provided it can do this from the bottom up instead of from the top down."
"In our opinion, these arrangements are not the right way forward."
"In fact, our objection would be much greater if, modelled on the German system, party structures and the drafting of lists of candidates were prescribed in detail, or if a distinction were drawn between parties which support a Europe that is governed in a centralist and uniform manner and those opposed to this, between centrally organised parties of individuals and loose associations of cooperating national parties or between large and small political movements."
"I am pleased to note that this proposal is now confined to a financing scheme and the monitoring of inappropriate use."
". (ES) Mr President, I shall speak very briefly, simply to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, once again for his work and the Greek Presidency for having smoothed the progress of this agreement."
"I do appreciate the point raised by Mr Corbett on the need for the anomalies in some of the translations to be corrected, but I believe that what we can infer from the various speeches that have been made is that - although some Members have certain reservations about the text or even objections to it - most of you, ladies and gentlemen, agree that this is a balanced text and one that will enable us to regulate a specific situation and which indicates the support that should be given precisely to those political parties that shape and promote the idea of Europe, in a transparent and responsible way."
"I hope that we can achieve a text that is adopted at first reading and avoid a debate that, as you all know very well, honourable Members and representatives of the Council, has been pursued at great length."
"I also hope that, thanks to this debate and to measures that have been adopted recently, we are finally going to be able to resolve the matter and move ahead with constructing the Europe that we all want to see: a Europe that is transparent, responsible and at the service of the citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, no country has been able to reduce poverty without a significant increase in energy use."
"Access to modern energy varies considerably, however."
"More than two billion people in the world do not have access to electricity or fuels and are reduced to using firewood and animal droppings for their energy needs."
"To mention just a few examples: cooking with poorly vented stoves has a significant impact upon health; hundreds of millions of women and children spend several hours a day gathering firewood for household needs; lack of electricity means inadequate lighting, limited communications and no access to refrigeration and to a host of labour-saving devices and income-generating opportunities."
"Modern energy services for these poor countries are therefore a crucial prerequisite for its being possible to eradicate poverty in these countries and for the latter being able to achieve what are termed the Millennium Development Goals."
"Most current forms of energy create environmental problems at local, regional and international levels that threaten both the present and future generations' health and prosperity."
"To find new ways of increasing energy services for the poor, at the same time as taking increased account of the environmental effects of energy use is one of our most important challenges."
"Despite the primary significance of the energy supply for development and growth, energy issues have, in general, been missing from the international development agenda and from the work done to combat poverty."
"For example, energy projects have accounted for less than 5% of EU aid since 1990."
"Last year in Johannesburg, something of a breakthrough occurred, and both energy initiatives launched by the Commission are more than welcome."
"Both the statement we are debating today and the EU's energy initiatives in Johannesburg underline the crucial importance of energy in the fight against poverty."
"A proper model is provided in terms of the general trend of the measures proposed, that is to say support for capacity-building, reform of the energy sector, management of the demand side, diversification of supply and the development of suitable regulations, financial mechanisms and public-private partnerships."
"Both initiatives suffer, however, from a number of limitations and shortcomings."
"In view of the huge challenges ahead, the proposals are not ambitious enough."
"No new financial resources are proposed."
"No doubt, the majority of the investments on the energy side will have to come from private sources, but there is also a tremendous need for resources in terms of aid."
"Otherwise, there is little hope of reaching the poor in rural areas."
"Moreover, the necessary transition to renewable energy and more efficient energy use can only happen with the help of specific financial support to help cover the higher up-front investments."
"We therefore propose in this report that a special Sustainable Energy Fund be set up, rather as the Commission has now set up a fund, worth EUR 1 billion, for efforts in the area of water."
"Another problem is that no clear distinction is made between the requirements in terms of policy development and investments, on the one hand at village level and on the other hand in the modern sector."
"The village level needs to be clearly specified and prioritised."
"Most of the oil imported by developing countries is used for transportation."
"The Commission's statement makes hardly any reference to the transport sector."
"There are examples - especially from Latin America in the form, for example, of the ethanol program in Brazil - of how, through practical efforts, it is in actual fact possible to bring about environmentally friendly development in the transport area."
"I do not have time to discuss further specific proposals and comments."
"I just want to sum up by saying that the Commission's proposals are, by and large, encouraging."
"If they are to be more than empty words, significant resources must, however, be contributed in order to stimulate investments in new and environmentally friendly technology - investments that are often rather expensive initially but that are cheaper over the projects' total life-cycle."
"Moreover, efforts at village level, where the majority of the poor live, must be clearly prioritised."
"It is there that the need for resources in terms of aid is at its greatest."
"I hope that Parliament will support my report and that the Commission will bear in mind our amendments, above all those concerning the demand for significantly increased financial resources."
"We must ensure that these sound proposals are more than just empty rhetoric."
". (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy cooperation with developing countries is clearly not a straightforward matter, but it is an issue that is crucial to everyone."
"Unless the energy dimension, and those of development and the environment are addressed appropriately at the same time we will really make very little progress."
"Furthermore, however, I wish to say that unless we address the issue of energy in developing countries, not only will those countries fail to develop properly; we will also be unable to confront problems such as combating climate change in a responsible and effective way."
"For this reason I wish to express my thanks to Mr Wijkman, who is rapporteur for the report we are discussing today."
"Mr Wijkman's combination of knowledge and persistence has resulted in a document that provides a useful contribution and boost to the work we still have to do to implement the Johannesburg conclusions in particular, on which we are working in the Commission and specifically in the Directorate-General for Energy."
"I have chosen to interpret the report as support for the proposal made in the Commission Communication and I have no problem with the amendments Mr Wijkman tabled last week."
"When the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport began preparing a document such as this, energy was not on the Johannesburg agenda."
"We started working on energy and development cooperation before energy appeared on the Johannesburg agenda."
"Energy then became the hot issue, or one of the hot issues, on the Johannesburg agenda, but we in the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport had already been working on it and I must say that I personally pushed for this approach."
"It must be made very clear: energy and water constitute life itself."
"Without water and energy, not only can there be no development, even survival is impossible."
"Having said that, I wish to make a few observations on the substance of the report, which I believe might be constructive and could smooth the way for future cooperation."
"Some of the specific proposals that have been made will need more detailed examination to ensure that coherence is maintained with the overall aim of development cooperation, in other words, eradicating poverty, combined with boosting a form of energy development that is balanced and sustainable."
"The resolution correctly notes that the Commission has been very modest in suggesting special and reserved funding for energy investment in developing countries."
"We are not overlooking the importance of funding; we are convinced, however, that funding must be based on demand."
"This is a key aspect of the European Union's energy policy for eradicating poverty and for achieving sustainable development."
"Only if and when our cooperation partners define developing their energy sector and make this a priority will the money begin to flow."
"What we can do and what we will do is talk to the developing countries, with whom we are already working, to ensure that this happens."
"In this context of cooperation I can give the commitment that - together with my colleague, Commissioner Nielson - we shall do everything possible to ensure that the expectations we all share are not disappointed."
"Mr Wijkman is quite right to propose that we must at least ensure that unused funds are channelled into useful energy projects instead of remaining unused."
"I fully share these positions."
"I also wish to say that the energy chapter is indeed still one of the least-present elements in cooperation and assistance for poverty eradication and for the development of the poorest countries."
"Nevertheless, I believe it is absolutely crucial - and I say this once again - that we are able to give it a boost."
"Energy has a role in education."
"Energy is involved in access to some of the new technologies that we must help to disseminate in those countries, precisely in order to prevent a worsening of today's poverty, which can be expressed simply as the difference in wealth between the developed and developing countries."
"There is a new divide in relation to the new technologies, which we in the developed countries have and enjoy and to which the developing countries, unfortunately, still do not have access."
"Here again, energy has a role to play and hence the importance of having presented this first Communication."
"This is the first, but not the last."
"I can inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that a new one is being prepared."
"The only difference is that, when the time comes, we will be able to present it with the backing of the conclusions obtained in Johannesburg and of the awareness-raising that has been carried out since then."
"Thank you very much Mr President, and thank you very much Mr Wijkman for your work."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Wijkman and the members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their useful input."
"An important report has been developed and improved insofar as development cooperation has been updated and extended to a domain that tended until recently to be governed by free market principles."
"From the global perspective in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists approaches the notions of development and cooperation, energy should be seen as a cross-cutting issue in cooperation actions."
"This is because it is a key aspect of sustainable development."
"The energy currently used in both developing and industrialised countries is polluting and environmentally destructive."
"Substantial resources will be needed to remedy the situation, however."
"The renewable and alternative sources of energy we advocate are expensive."
"The Commission must make available the resources required to finance access to renewable energies for developing countries."
"It would then be possible to integrate the environmental dimension into the development process, and it would not remain a pious declaration of intent."
"As Mr Wijkman stated earlier this evening, energy accounts for less than 5% of Community development aid."
"Public sector involvement in the energy sector is called for."
"I should emphasise that public investment is also needed, without prejudice to the involvement of private companies in the production and distribution of energy."
"Access to the latter should be guaranteed by the public sector as an essential service."
"In this connection, we cannot endorse the Commission's decision that priority should be given to promotion of the privatisation of the sector."
"It should be complementary to public action."
"Private exploitation of energy sources does not help to alleviate poverty."
"There are some appalling poverty indicators for African countries that export energy resources such as fossil fuels exploited by private companies."
"Very often these companies are European."
"It should be stated that these populations do not have access to electricity, lighting or water."
"They do not benefit from other more sophisticated uses of energy either."
"Financial support is therefore needed."
"The Commission itself does actually recognise the link between poverty, environmental degradation and energy."
"The Commissioner referred to this today."
"Nonetheless, the Commission fails to make bold environmentally-sustainable proposals."
"We therefore welcome this initiative to work together with developing countries regarding energy."
"Nonetheless, we regret the lack of a crash programme with additional funding and a proposal that would serve as a legal basis for the action required on this important issue."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Wijkman and thank him for being so open to dialogue and willing to listen to the amendments put forward in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"The Johannesburg Summit rightly affirmed that access to energy for the poor has become a priority, since it is so very true that the populations' vital needs in this respect are far from being satisfied and the trend is still away from equality; the main reason for this is the developed countries' fossil fuel consumption, in particular US consumption, which is excessive and very much out of proportion to that of the developing countries."
"Life expectancy and development are closely linked to access to energy, to the point that many see it as a real basic human right."
"That right must be recognised, guaranteed and protected."
"How can we contribute to the existence and development of an efficient energy sector in the developing countries without policies that encourage close cooperation for the exchange of know-how, the primary objective being to meet the vital needs of the populations?"
"The need for finance is evident."
"The creation of a Sustainable Energy Fund and much more consistent participation by the European Union could be a first response."
"In particular, as the report rightly says, the existence of a strong public sector in the energy sector is particularly important in the first phase of development."
"More than that, as the majority of the Committee on Development and Cooperation has said, I remain convinced that the Commission's options for privatisation of the energy sector are more than dangerous."
"The Commission's role is not to promote privatisation in the developing countries."
"The exploitation and distribution of primary energy, which is essential for development, must be handled by public or private companies committed to public service and general interest goals."
"Such public control is all the more vital because the trans-national corporations that operate in the developing countries are all too often concerned only with short-term profitability, to the detriment of the needs of the local populations and at the risk of plundering their energy resources."
"Effective machinery must be deployed to monitor the activities of European undertakings in particular."
"I also support the call on the Commission to review deregulation of the energy sector from a human development perspective and to work towards international trade norms which abide by human rights and peoples' rights."
"Finally, seeing that next September's WTO Summit in Cancun is not far away, we must refuse to allow the energy sector to be included in the general agreement on trade in services, which would make energy a commodity like any other."
"The aim of universal access to energy in the service of development will not be achieved by following a model imposed by the liberal thinking of multilateral bodies like the WTO, but by expanding and guaranteeing the public service to meet the needs of the populations."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Wikjman again, and to respond very briefly."
"I have to say that we do not seem to have read the same document."
"The two speakers appear to have read a different Commission document from the one I am familiar with."
"I find this surprising, because nowhere in the Commission's document does it state that the Commission advocates the privatisation of energy services in developing countries."
"That is another kettle of fish altogether. Please remember that, ladies and gentlemen."
"True, we have proposed privatisation."
"Actually, it was liberalisation, not privatisation, and the two are quite different."
"Further, the proposal was made in the context of energy systems in the integrated European market."
"None of this has anything to do, however, with what you attributed to a text but does not actually appear in that text."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I challenge you to tell me on which page we advocated privatising energy systems in developing countries."
"Give me the page reference please, ladies and gentlemen."
"When you come up with the number of the page where we allegedly made that statement, I might be moved to recognise it does not make sense."
"I can however assure you here and now that it makes no sense whatsoever."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are today concerned with the millions upon millions of human beings the world over who do not have electricity and are therefore deprived of a whole range of opportunities for their personal development, training and access to technology."
"These people cannot take advantage of all the opportunities modern society has to offer."
"I put it to you that there is no time to waste discussing what does not appear in the document presented to the House."
"We should focus instead on genuine issues of substance."
"Please do not confuse a debate concerning regulation of energy markets within the European Union with support for development and the role of energy in promoting development in developing countries."
"These are two quite different issues."
"Money may be private or public."
"What is actually needed however are funds and resources."
"I should point out to the House that in the majority of those countries, the most serious problem is the corruption rife amongst the ruling elite, that is, in the public sector."
"Such then is the nature of the public sector in those countries."
"So, we would do well to deal sensibly with the issues in hand."
"I urge you to refrain from commenting on what does not appear in the text, and not to confuse documents."
"Mr President, I can understand the Commissioner's annoyance."
"It may be due to the late hour or to the fact that she is aware more funds are to be invested to see through the crash programme I referred to."
"I am certainly prepared to have a calmer discussion with the Commissioner."
"What I actually said was that I believe it is all well and good to resort to private funds, but public funds must be invested also, and that the Commission is prioritising private funds."
"I do not of course have any intention of going through the text article by article and line by line. I am however delighted to learn that the Commissioner is prepared to invest public funds and Union funds to help these developing countries."
"Of course I am aware that there are many corrupt governments in Africa and indeed elsewhere."
"What the people of those countries do not need, however, is for European companies to exploit their energy resources."
"Instead, Europe should support the public services to ensure those populations do have access to electricity and water."
"Both are central to the quality of life, and I was delighted to hear the Commissioner acknowledge this."
"Mr President, I would just like to add a word to the same effect."
"First to thank the Commissioner because I think holding debates in which ideas can contend is the way to make progress."
"That is what happened in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Not everyone was in agreement with all the points in the report, but that does not prevent me from wanting the debate to continue, because it must exist."
"I mentioned just now the general agreement on trade in services, for example."
"The debate on this subject is public, it exists."
"I want it to continue."
"Like Mrs Sauquillo, I also want to thank the Commissioner for what she said about the Commission's commitment to greater funding."
"The needs are in fact so great I think we can agree together to be generous in this."
"Mr President, I shall not prolong the debate."
"I am grateful for the contributions made."
"Allow me merely to make a small point concerning the discussion of whether investments should be private or public."
"I believe, exactly like Mrs de Palacio, that we need all the resources we can obtain."
"What is important is that there be regulations in each country ensuring that people with small incomes have access to energy, that is to say that we have sound regulations in this area."
"I believe that competition between different companies is, then, to be preferred to monopolies, irrespective of whether they are public or private."
"Thank you for the debate. I hope we shall come nicely to an agreement tomorrow in the vote."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11a.m."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this recommendation for second reading on the Council common position on the proposal to amend the 'Seveso directive' warrants a brief synopsis of its history."
"In the sensitive climate of the tragic accidents which have affected the chemical industry and, in particular, the communities living in the areas surrounding these sites, as well as the environment, the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal to amend Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996, which lays down provisions, of course, on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances."
"The proposal had the merit of being based on very thorough scientific work and of providing a constructive analysis of this sensitive matter."
"At first reading, I and other Members explained why it is necessary for the European Parliament to send out a signal loud and clear."
"My aim - which I confirm today - is, as far as possible, to ensure that such accidents are never repeated, ensuring both the safety of the citizens and workers at these plants and, of course, environmental protection."
"The Council has produced a common position which essentially takes into account many of Parliament's concerns, but a number of grey areas still remain, and these are the following."
"Firstly, the inclusion of mining activities and land-fill sites, an issue on which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has decided to retable the amendments from first reading, in other words the inclusion in the scope of the directive of all types of preparation and processing of dangerous substances in these sites - not just chemical or thermal preparations, that is, as envisaged by the Commission."
"I would point out, moreover, that we are only talking about active plant."
"We are aware that the Commission has, just recently, launched a specific proposal for a directive on the management of waste from mining activities, the terms of which will, moreover, have to be decided together with the European Parliament at the appropriate time, but, until then, there is and will continue to be a gap in the law which, given the recent accidents which have alarmed public opinion, cannot be tolerated."
"However, I am not excluding the possibility that the progress of the new directive on mining activities through conciliation might make it easier to reach agreement on this point."
"The second question is that of staff training."
"Here too, taking the same line as the Commission this time, we have proposed specific training measures on managing emergencies for all staff, including the staff of sub-contracting firms."
"Indeed, it is appropriate to provide for adequate measures not just on the handling of dangerous substances but on managing emergencies too, in order to limit potential damage as far as possible and to guarantee workers' safety fully."
"However, as rapporteur, I feel it is unnecessary to include the list of training measures in the notification provided for in Article 6 of the directive, which is why I would urge you to vote against Amendment No 3, as at first reading."
"The third question is that of urban development planning."
"In this area, the Council has already taken into consideration Parliament's desire to lay the foundations for definition at European level of methodological criteria which are necessary to assess compatibility between the sites in question and the areas at risk, not least by means of Union funding."
"However, given the great diversity of rules, regional situations, competences and responsibilities which characterises this aspect of safety - situating plant in terms of urban development planning - I believe that we must, of necessity, invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave it up to the Member States to decide on the minimum distances."
"That is why I have called for a split vote on Amendment No 6, and will only vote for the first part of the amendment."
"As regards the map showing risk areas, the committee believes that the pictorial representation of areas adjacent to the establishments subject to accident risks would be an effective, easily comprehensible measure for all the citizens concerned, who are entitled to greater clarity in this regard."
"To this end, the rapporteur has incorporated the wording used by the European Commission in the amended proposal for a directive."
"Lastly, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has proposed once again that a distinction should be made between forms of potassium nitrate, with new thresholds, in order to avoid farmers who use a form of potassium nitrate which could not be classed as fuel, falling within the scope of the directive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main points."
"Clearly, we are on track for a conciliation procedure."
"Indeed, the Council was unable to reach agreement on a compromise package and it did not, if the truth be known, seem to me to be particularly interested in achieving such an agreement with Parliament."
"I remain confident, however, that, with a constructive debate, it will be possible to achieve a solution which ensures maximum safety in these plants."
"I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on the Environment and the staff of the European Commission, who have been particularly helpful and cooperative."
". Mr President, first of all, a special thank you goes to the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, for his valuable work on this proposal."
"As you are aware, the Commission proposal under discussion seeks to broaden the scope of the Seveso II Directive in the light of the Baia Mare and Enschede accidents."
"Furthermore, it seeks to incorporate the recommendations of two studies, one dealing with carcinogens and the other with substances which are dangerous to the aquatic environment."
"Whilst the Commission proposal did not originally contain measures related to the Toulouse accident, a number of amendments proposed by Parliament have been incorporated into the Commission's amended proposal and subsequently into the Council's common position."
"I would like to stress again that it was not the intention of the Commission to effect a major overhaul of the Seveso II Directive."
"I shall now comment on some of the proposed amendments."
"Amendments Nos 9 to 11 on risk mapping and potassium nitrate were already accepted by the Commission during the first reading and consequently they figure in the Commission's amended proposal."
"These were the only three amendments that were fully rejected by the Council when adopting its common position."
"The Commission continues to support these amendments and can furthermore accept Amendment No 8 related to training for emergencies."
"I am pleased to tell you that a proposal for a directive on the management of mining waste was adopted by the Commission on 2 June 2003."
"The measures in the proposal complement those outlined in the Seveso II Directive and include the establishment of a major accident prevention policy and a safety management system."
"These measures will apply to those waste management facilities that present an accident risk but will not be covered by the revised Seveso II Directive."
"In our opinion, the Seveso II Directive should only apply to the most dangerous mining activities where chemical processes are involved and chemical substances are stored on site."
"The Seveso II Directive should not be transformed into either mining legislation or waste legislation."
"Therefore the Commission cannot agree to deleting the words 'chemical and thermal' as proposed in Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"We also reject Amendment No 12 which proposes making a reference to Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Amendment No 13, which seems to suggest that there are gaps in the coverage of mining sites through the two proposals."
"In our opinion this is not the case."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 4 would lead to requiring operators of Seveso lower-tier sites to include information on training measures in the notification and to inform the competent authority in the event of a modification of an installation, establishment or storage area."
"In our view this would introduce bureacratic burdens without improving safety."
"A notification should only provide certain minimum information."
"The issue of training is already appropriately addressed in the Directive; moreover, in the event of modifications, the reviews of the major accident prevention policy and the safety management system are important, not the notification."
"I acknowledge Parliament's strong wish to reinforce Article 12 of the Seveso II Directive."
"However, the Commission and the Council have already accepted related amendments presented in the first reading."
"Amendment No 6 does not constitute an added value; on the contrary, there is no need for separate guidelines setting out a methodology on minimum safety distances, as it should be possible to derive these distances from the technical database that will be created as a tool to help assess the compatibility between Seveso sites and sensitive sites."
"Furthermore, the Commission continues to be of the opinion that a development of incentive schemes and/or funding for the relocation of establishments is a task for Member States - this is subsidiarity."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 7."
"To conclude, let me confirm the Commission's position on all amendments."
"The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 11."
"Amendments Nos 1 to 7 and Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are not acceptable."
"I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest to have this proposal adopted and implemented as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Lisi most sincerely for the work he has accomplished."
"As has just been said, tomorrow Parliament will have to vote on this report's second reading and, as with other reports, we here are of course divided between the wish to take negotiations with the Council and Commission as far as possible and the desire to get this text finalised quickly so it can be implemented as soon as possible."
"At the end of the first reading, the Council incorporated a large number of amendments adopted by Members, but also rejected several proposals."
"A few weeks ago, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted by a very large majority a text which confirms the requirements to which we will have to submit if we want to make progress on prevention."
"On these questions, the European Union must show its unity and its willingness to improve the legislation in force in answer to the legitimate concerns of the European citizens."
"It is also an opportunity for us to give some meaning to this European construction which is often accused of devoting more time to drawing up product standards than to the Europeans' well-being, let alone their health."
"I am therefore glad that the Committee on the Environment has adopted the amendments concerning obligations to notify the competent authorities, because we need to be very demanding in this area without, Commissioner, being bureaucratic: there is no reason why we cannot simplify the documents."
"The amendments concerning training for all staff, including staff of subcontractors, seem to me to be essential, because it has been evident from several accidents that a lack of training and of information was involved."
"On the question of safety distances between establishments and sensitive areas, the terrible accident in Toulouse showed the weaknesses in the relevant legislation and we must include these things in our report, just as we must in future extend the mapping of sensitive areas."
"One point presents a problem and seems to be meeting with stiff opposition from the Council and the Commission, as you have just said, Commissioner; it is the question of extending the scope to all mining and waste processing activities using dangerous substances."
"The Council and the Commission want to restrict the scope of the Seveso II Directive to the chemical and thermal processing of waste only; they justify this position by the fact that in its proposal concerning mining waste the Commission refers, in Article 6 on the prevention of major accidents, to the provisions of the amended Seveso II Directive."
"However, if we want to avoid a legal void concerning certain mining activities and certain methods of processing mining waste until this new legislative proposal is adopted, the European Parliament must vote in favour of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 13 without prejudice to the scope of the future report and with no talk of redundancies."
"I would therefore like Parliament to adopt the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, thus strengthening on-site prevention and the safety of European citizens."
"Like the Council, we want to reach an agreement in this stage of the legislative procedure but, I hope you understand, not at any price."
"Mr President, more than three years have now passed since the fireworks disaster in Enschede."
"We still have not succeeded in laying down an amended directive."
"This amendment is essential in order, as far as possible, to prevent the same accidents from happening again."
"We should not therefore wait any longer."
"The Council and European Commission are apparently of the opinion that Parliament tabled too many amendments at first reading."
"Parliament's proposals have not been adopted because they are said to fall outside the scope of this directive."
"According to the Council, since it would be too time-consuming to look at these proposals in detail, it dismissed them for the sake of convenience."
"It is, for example, beyond me why the Council refuses to accept the addition of potassium nitrate."
"The adapted legislation will undoubtedly reduce the risk of accidents, but there will always be risks."
"In the unlikely event of a calamity, it is imperative to keep the consequences to an absolute minimum."
"It remains therefore of continued importance for minimum distances between hazardous installations and residential areas to be examined carefully."
"Of course, I appreciate that the implementation of this is not equally simple for every Member State."
"In the final analysis, the economic interests have to be weighed up against public safety."
"Safety should assume an important place."
"I subscribe to the importance of well-trained staff, so that preventive and emergency measures can be taken as effectively as possible."
"In addition, I would like to point out that the enforcement of this legislation by central and local governments is essential."
"This also means providing the public with sound information."
"Clear danger maps, which identify the special risks to residents, constitute a sound addition to this legislation."
"The Council should also be able to subscribe to the above."
"I would therefore take this opportunity of calling on the Council, and hence the European Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, to adopt Parliament's amendments, thus enabling us to lay down revised legislation immediately without having to go through an extended conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, like everyone else I welcome this report and I congratulate the rapporteur for his work. He has been thorough and consistent and has applied himself."
"We have moved a considerable step forward since this Directive was last considered for amendment in this House in Strasbourg in 1994 - I know because I was there."
"Events in Toulouse and in Enschede have demonstrated the need for action to amend and reinforce the existing Directive, so as to avoid any possibility of accidents and to minimise damage should an accident occur."
"A future directive on pipeline safety and a proposal with regard to tunnel safety will also be very welcome because they respond to promises made during the last reading in 1994 and also to events, some of them very tragic, that have occurred consequently in other parts of the Union."
"The common position is, in fact, quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems."
"There are still issues that remain unaddressed - issues that are quite clear and evident to us because of events that have taken place in the recent past."
"Everywhere else we have responded."
"We responded to Enschede and Toulouse with this Directive."
"We have responded with directives to events that have caused us to be concerned about tunnel safety and pipeline safety."
"We are going to miss the chance to respond properly and completely unless we amend this common position to cover other events that have taken place in recent times within and outside the Union."
"The events of Baia Mare in Romania and Doñana in Spain demonstrate the need to take action with regard to mining safety and mining waste safety."
"Until we see the mining waste directive we cannot relent on amendments that we have previously passed in this committee and in this Parliament to ensure that action is taken with regard to those dangerous substances and activities, not necessarily utilising dangerous substances that clearly need regulation."
"Put them in the mining waste directive, Commission, and we will relent on the amendments."
"That is a reasonable remark."
"Other issues have still to be addressed."
"In 1994 we argued very strongly the case to have some kind of discussions on distance."
"We still do not have a solution on that and that is why we maintain the amendments and insist they are placed in the common position."
"Finally, on safety reports and some of the technical issues, I would ask the Commission to think again."
"They are produced and directed at you in the light of our own experiences."
"Please act on them."
"Mr President, we are on the verge of deciding on the revision of the so-called Seveso Directive."
"Nearly a year ago, I remarked in this House that we are locking the stable door after the horse has bolted."
"This was an appeal to the Council to ensure that we use the revision of the directive as an opportunity to plug existing holes, so that accidents of the kind that took place in Baia Mare, Toulouse and Enschede can be prevented in future."
"In Enschede, it transpired that current Seveso legislation is insufficient."
"A fireworks factory which did not fall within the scope of the directive destroyed an entire housing estate."
"Human suffering was huge, and the grieving for the victims continues."
"Residents of this housing estate were not aware of the presence of the fireworks factory."
"Authorities were only aware up to a point."
"It is therefore logical to tighten up the rules."
"Of particular importance, in my view, is the drafting of a method for establishing minimum distances."
"The European Commission should set up guidelines for this purpose, because it is about time we knew exactly what a safe distance is."
"A safe distance in the Netherlands is considered 25 metres, in France 500 metres and in Germany as many as 1 000 metres."
"An objective method for establishing the safe distance is important for those living nearby but, above all, also for the local politicians."
"Hazardous factories do not belong in housing estates."
"An active policy should be adopted in order to remove them from those estates, if possible with the help of European funding."
"In addition, it is important for maps to be drawn up which indicate the areas in the vicinity of an establishment that could be affected after a major accident."
"Every citizen is entitled to this information."
"Tightening up the rules is one thing, observing them and being accountable is another."
"We can lay down rules ad infinitum, but if they are not implemented in municipal practice, they will have little effect in the end."
"If nobody feels responsible, if organisations each work in a vacuum, legislation remains a paper exercise."
"Safety is not only a matter of rules, but also of culture."
"It is a public task to actively promote this culture."
"Where safety is concerned, we should not cut any corners."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, I do not know if I should read anything into the fact that environmental issues tend to be discussed last thing in the evening."
"It certainly is not the best time to do so."
"I should first like to say that the Commission's communication describes the current state of the marine environment."
"It refers to the pressures and threats the latter is under."
"In particular, it highlights the dangers posed by industry, fishing, agriculture, transport, the exploitation of gas and oil fields and the accidental introduction of species."
"All these activities can have very serious consequences."
"I would remind you of the recent Prestige disaster and the Erika accident three years ago."
"Further, this communication recognises the lack of an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment at Union level."
"The Commission sets out 14 objectives and 23 actions."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we endeavoured to define these objectives more clearly and to broaden the scope of certain actions."
"In general, we tried to work towards a strategy for the protection of the marine environment consistent with European legislation and with the present condition of European waters."
"The communication reiterates that the two key references are the Sixth Community Environmental Action Programme and the Johannesburg Summit."
"Section 10 of the Johannesburg action plan emphasises the importance of sustainable development."
"It states that oceans, seas, islands and coasts are key components of our planet's ecosystems and essential to food safety."
"The loss of biodiversity as a result of accidents and the social and economic consequences of this loss have yet to be quantified."
"The Sixth Programme contains an important chapter calling for the protection of the marine environment to be strengthened."
"It also calls for environmental issues to be integrated into all other policies, and for commitment to a clear plan of action to curb the negative impact on biodiversity."
"It also appeals for more sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources."
"In addition, it recalls the Montreal Declaration on the Protection of the Marine Environment."
"It is important to describe the relationship between the strategy for protection of the marine environment and all other policies."
"These include policies relating to fisheries, agriculture, transport and chemicals."
"To this end, environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment should be used when developing activities, plans and programmes, as they are much more appropriate instruments."
"Objective 9 concerning transport and maritime security is of particular importance at the moment."
"The Committee on the Environment was of the opinion that it should be strengthened. This despite the fact that in the wake of the Erika accident, and particularly after the more recent disaster involving the Prestige, two reports on the subject were adopted in the last plenary."
"A further two reports were adopted in the Committee on the Environment this week."
"Nonetheless, further directives and communications are still being debated."
"There is a very important report on the Prestige by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and this chapter needs strengthening."
"The situation in European seas is not good, even though it has emerged from monitoring and assessment programmes that information on the marine environment is insufficient."
"In fact, we are recalling that the principles that should inform this new marine strategy must include the precautionary principle, the 'polluter pays' principle, a clear concept of sustainability, an integrated approach to management of both the coastal and offshore marine environments, strategic environmental assessment and a regional approach taking account of regional diversities."
"In addition, account should be taken of all the relevant existing international initiatives such as OSPAR, HELCOM and ICES."
"They must not be seen as substitutes, however."
"We also believe that the notions of sustainable fishing, the interaction between fishing and sea birds, the balance between fish stocks, fishing effort and the environment are crucial."
"Mr President, we realise this is only a first step."
"We await a Commission proposal on an effective strategy for protection of the marine environment."
"Nonetheless, I would like to thank all members of the Committee on the Environment personally for their effective input."
"It is thanks to them that the quality of this document is as good as it could possibly be."
"Mr President, when you look at the list of threats to marine biodiversity, overfishing is the first problem that is mentioned."
"The main environmental damage is caused by overfishing of depleted stocks of commercially valuable fish, not to mention damage to non-targeted species including fish and damage to the marine habitat such as coral beds."
"When you actually look at the Commission's approach to the whole issue of fisheries over the last few years, you will see that the Commission in fact used to be the most progressive of the EU institutions, pushing very hard for conservation and reasonable management of fish stocks with, of course, the obvious exception of third-country agreements."
"But over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the Commission."
"Take, for example, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy: despite all the fine words and the good proposals put forward by the Commission, it is clear, when you actually look at what has come out, that this is really a shadow of what was proposed."
"While there are some good possibilities in there, most of it basically requires an effort of political will on the part of Member States."
"One just has to look, for example, at the negotiations over cod and other TACs during the December meeting to see that there is no political will there."
"It is interesting that the Swedish Commissioner is here."
"Take the recent decision by Sweden, seeking to bring in more conservation measures in relation to cod: they were prevented from doing that."
"This sends out a very bad signal."
"If a Member State is willing and progressive enough to take more stringent measures then surely it should be allowed to do that."
"It is a regrettable decision and it is also unjustifiable."
"Consider, too, a Member State's commitment in relation to the basic regulation which was reviewed last December: again, they took out the opportunity which was used by the Spanish in the past to ban driftnets."
"This possibility was removed and I cannot understand why."
"We should also look at the issue of, for example, blue whiting."
"Over the past number of years the European Union has been doing the right thing by trying to convince other countries to be reasonable in relation to the kind of quotas they set for themselves."
"But if you look at what the Commission is actually doing now, it seems that it is changing its approach to this."
"It seems that it has basically decided to participate in the overfishing."
"It has indicated that it is going to abandon the idea of restraining other fishing countries and is going to dramatically increase the Union's own fishing activities."
"That contributes to the depletion of stocks."
"There is a major contradiction in what the Commission is doing and I wish the Commission would revert to its previous approach of being extremely progressive on the conservation of fisheries."
"It should try to pull the Member States along, because the Member States are being dictated to by the industry."
"We are going to end up with a serious problem in relation to the marine environment."
"It is already there and we need to be a lot more progressive."
"Mr President, the Prestige disaster cast a harsh light on marine pollution."
"It was a dramatic event that figured prominently in the media, and it highlighted institutional and political malfunctions. But it was in fact only the tip of the iceberg."
"Marine ecosystems are threatened by many other polluters besides single hull ships, and their biodiversity, be it marine flora or marine fauna, is at risk."
"There are many predators."
"First, overfishing and illegal fishing, which exhaust fish stocks, but also discharges from land, fertilizer and agricultural pesticide residues, clandestine degassing of ships, products from oil platforms, all of them human activities that have taken nothing into account apart from immediate gain, which have no prospects for sustainable development and have no concern for the environment."
"It is to the Commission's credit that it has drawn up an inventory of these risks, recorded the state of knowledge about them and reviewed the conventions and various laws that might control those risks at different levels: international, European, national or regional."
"On the basis of that inventory, the Commission has built a very goal-oriented strategy for protecting marine resources, with clear objectives and an action plan."
"Mrs González Álvarez's excellent report welcomes this effort, but it also suggests, first of all, that the Commission should go beyond analysis and be tougher and more precise about the action to be taken and, in particular, the time scale for that action."
"Especially when there are still gaps in our knowledge of a particular field, the precautionary principle must be followed for rapid intervention, to which we should add the polluter-pays principle and that of sustainable development."
"In this context, there is a need for a radical change to the legislation governing international shipping and a review of the old conventions that do not include these principles."
"The report's second suggestion to the Commission is that it should expand its communication by stressing various aspects that were perhaps not sufficiently developed."
"Examples include areas of particular vulnerability (the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas have been listed), dangerous substances that have not yet been mentioned (such as the various nitrogenous substances, hydrocarbons and discharges from land), activities that have remained in the background, such as flags of convenience, or species that are more particularly endangered, such as posidonia."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy received both the Commission communication and Mrs Álvarez's report very warmly indeed."
"Fundamental opposition from Parliament will certainly not emerge tomorrow."
"But while we can hope that the Commission will be firm and vigilant in the matter, we may be forgiven for having more fears about the Council, where there will have to be a real political will to implement this integrated strategy for the protection of marine resources."
"The past has shown that internal resistance, sometimes linked to national interests, can hinder the best thought-out European strategic policies."
"Hence the González Álvarez report's justified insistence that concrete steps be taken right away as part of an integrated strategy at all levels of power, but also at all geographical levels, including local authorities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Convention proposes that the conservation of the sea's biological resources must be the exclusive competence of the EU, while fishing should be an area in which the EU and the Member States have shared competence."
"This issue has been sidelined in the major debate about the future."
"Anyone familiar with issues relating to fisheries will find it very hard to understand that the Convention has proposed separating these areas."
"Rules concerning the way in which fishing is conducted are the very rules through which we enact decisions concerning the conservation of biological resources."
"Through provisions concerning mesh sizes, fishing periods and permitted gear, fishing can be regulated and the marine environment conserved."
"What, moreover, is really important for the marine environment is that aid to the floating fish factories should cease."
"For myself and many others, it is unclear how the Convention's proposal would work in practice."
"What, for example, would it mean for seals and for the fishing industry?"
"Where these matters are concerned, I hope that, for example, the Commissioner would explain to those who fish in the Kvarken straits, the Gulf of Finland and the archipelagoes what the outcome of this decision would be."
"I appeal to the Commission to clarify its positions on these issues too."
"If EU measures in favour of the marine environment are to produce results, there must be closer compliance with the rules, fewer exceptions and more effective international cooperation."
"We are successful internationally when we cooperate on matters such as the Oil Fund, to quote just one example."
"It also means, however, that the Member States must be prepared to take a stand on important proposals, such as the most recent one to impose penalties in connection with deliberate discharges of oil."
"Unfortunately, we see, however, the way in which legal hair-splitting constitutes an obstacle to the directive in the Council."
"Despite the fact that a Directive on oil reception facilities has been adopted, there has been no reduction in deliberate oil discharges."
"Commissioner, I would finally appeal to you to get a firm grip on HELCOM - the Helsinki Commission for Baltic Marine Environment Protection."
"It must not be a relic from the Cold War, merely issuing recommendations that do not lead to any measures being taken."
"Following the EU's enlargement, it will be possible for HELCOM to be a body attending to its task in accordance with the Water Framework Directive."
"If it is to be reformed, HELCOM needs the support of the Commission, especially when, for the first time in history, the new boss, who takes office on 1 August, is a woman."
"This organisation can implement the regional way of tackling things that both Parliament and the Commission wish to see."
"I would also ask Commissioner Wallström to convince her colleague, Mrs de Palacio, that the Commission must be more active in supporting Finland and Sweden when it comes to ice classification."
"Unfortunately, it was only Italy and the Commission that opposed the Nordic proposals concerning clearer shipping rules in this part of the EU too."
"Mr President, very little is as yet known about the submarine environment."
"That is why, moreover, it is hard to organise any sort of viable programme of protection."
"Stocks of some monitored, familiar species, that is to say mainly economically important species, have in many places diminished drastically."
"How can we protect species, therefore, about which we still do not even know anything?"
"Protection is nevertheless the starting point for the EU marine strategy."
"Consequently, I too have proposed that we should grant sufficient appropriations to enable us to carry out an investigation and draw up an inventory of submarine species."
"The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, HELCOM, has made more than 200 recommendations for improving the state of the Baltic."
"These are not binding on the Member States but the Commission might examine them and propose rules based on them that are."
"In the same way, EU investment is needed for the protection of nature in the northern seas."
"This would come about most effectively if the EU joined the Nordic countries, the United States of America, Canada and Russia as members of the Arctic Council."
"That would promote shared Euro-Atlantic understanding of environmental problems."
"There are environments in the European Union, such as many areas of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, where the natural environment would not necessarily recover properly from a large-scale oil disaster."
"That is why we must have more talks with countries such as Russia to develop stricter common standards for merchant vessels."
"It is vital that oil tankers sailing in the sort of difficult icy conditions there were last winter are immune to risk."
"The Commission should propose an amendment, within the framework of UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would allow intervention with regard to merchant vessels from third countries sailing through or close to EU waters if they are thought to be a potentially serious threat."
"In addition to oil disasters we should also consider, for example, the loud noise made by equipment used in mapping the location of natural resources to be a pollutant."
"I would furthermore like to draw the attention of the Commission, and the Council too for that matter, to the Member States' unsatisfactory capacity for tackling oil spills."
"I myself looked into the situation recently when I sent out questionnaires to those authorities in the Baltic countries responsible for this matter."
"The replies made disappointing reading."
"The situation was best in Finland and Sweden, where the equipment they have would be sufficient in practice for clearing the oil coming from a broken fuel tank on a large passenger ship."
"If there were a major disaster the equipment in these countries would be insufficient even if it were used in combination."
"Around 40 million tonnes of oil a year already pass through the Gulf of Finland, for example, and it is supposed that this volume will have doubled in 10 year's time."
"The Commission should initiate a survey of capacity for tackling oil spills and adopt rules for sufficient minimum capacity based on regional conditions and volumes of traffic."
". Mr President, thank you for this valuable input towards developing a marine strategy and special thanks to Mrs Thors because she provided me with an action plan supplementing my own Commission action plan which I also find very interesting."
"As regards the deliberations of the Convention, I cannot really know the answer as to why this became the end result of trying to establish a list of competences because, as you rightly say, this looks very curious and very strange to most people."
"Maybe, however, there is a deeper legal meaning to it and maybe it will prove to be helpful."
"However, I cannot give you a clear reply to that."
"You have made a number of important points which we have to follow up and you have also demonstrated the whole width of this issue."
"It encompasses, of course, many different aspects of the marine environment and this is what we must now continue to work on very practically. I have taken note of everything you have said."
"Thank you very much for your useful input, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Additives in animal nutrition"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0176/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition [15776/2/2002 - C5-0132/2003 - 2002/0073(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert)."
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is - I believe - an important topic that we have on the agenda this morning: the prohibition of antibiotics in animal nutrition."
"Before we come to what I hope will be the conclusion to this matter, I would like to thank everyone most warmly: my fellow Members, the staff of the political groups and also the secretariat, all of whom have done such hard work on this."
"Parliament has been calling for many years for antibiotics to be banned as growth-promoting additives in animal feed, and today we are going to make it a reality in Europe."
"In our debate on the second reading of this proposal for a regulation, it is certainly apparent that there are widely divergent views on the value of additives in animal feed."
"The use of antibiotics as growth-promoting additives in the fattening of livestock will now be banned in the EU once and for all with effect from 31 December 2005."
"I see this policy decision as long overdue in view of the growing resistance to various antibiotics used in the medical treatment of patients."
"Feedingstuffs imported into the EU from third states must of course take account of the requirements of this new regulation in the same way as those produced within Europe."
"One important topic in the preparatory debate was the open declaration of flavourings in feedingstuffs."
"Our constant watchword was 'let it have in what it says on the tin', but I do take the view that we must not go too far."
"The open declaration of flavourings in feedingstuffs has now been dealt with in a compromise between the Council, the Commission, and Parliament."
"At present, over three hundred flavourings are permitted, and these have been subject to the strictest controls and supervision in the course of production."
"It is for this reason that all the final formulations of flavourings in feedingstuffs no longer have to be declared individually."
"I think - and this is an important point - that, in the sphere of business competition, we should also, in the European Union, be aware of the fact that there is such a thing as corporate know-how, and protecting this corporate know-how, should be a matter of major concern to all of us in the political sphere."
"That is why the new rule in the proposal is an exact parallel to existing rules applicable to food for human beings."
"We must not apply more stringent rules to animals than we do where people are concerned."
"That, Commissioner Byrne, is why I see Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which deal with this subject, as particularly important, and I would be glad if you would briefly state what view you take of them."
"The main point of the compromise is, however, the use of histomonostats and coccidiostats, which are antibiotic additives that will continue to be urgently needed in poultry farming."
"We are not talking here about the use of antibiotics to promote growth; these products are used to protect animals, and their use as a means of preventing disease in animals strikes me as a vitally important topic, as these are agents that we cannot, at present, do without."
"I speak from personal experience, having, myself, some years ago, been deeply involved in the field of turkey-rearing."
"It is generally regarded as inevitable that the disease known as 'blackhead', which occurs very frequently in poultry farming - and, I might add, in organic farming as well - will wipe out up to 60% of livestock if we are no longer permitted to use these products."
"So, whilst these agents will not be permitted as additives indefinitely, they will still be permitted for a limited period."
"Our intention, Commissioner, in this time-limit in Amendment No 16, is to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the pharmaceutical industry to get them to produce suitable alternative products or, instead, to develop new vaccines."
"Today's vote will see us making a definite advance in the protection of consumers in the European Union, and I very much hope that, at 11 a.m., every side of this House will be able to come together to vote accordingly."
". Mr President, I am very happy that the second reading has contributed to filling the gap between the positions of the institutions on the Commission's proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition."
"I want to congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report, which points out the major questions we are dealing with."
"In short, let me recall the main points of the proposal that were accepted on first reading by the Parliament and by the Council."
"Firstly, we will have a clear and transparent authorisation procedure."
"The European Food Safety Authority will be the first port of call and will be in charge of evaluating all feed additives."
"In future, the validity of authorisations will be limited to ten years."
"The new system has an in-built review and re-evaluation process in order to take new scientific information into account."
"Companies must demonstrate the positive effect on the animal or in the feed and the absence of any risk to human health, animal health or the environment when applying for authorisation or re-authorisation of a feed additive."
"At present, four antibiotics are authorised for use in animal feed as growth promoters."
"The EU has already phased out the use in feedingstuffs of all antibiotics that are also used in human and veterinary medicine, in order to avoid cross-resistance."
"The four which are currently authorised are not used in any human antibiotic drugs."
"I am glad to hear that the Parliament, as well as the Council, is in agreement with the line of the Commission to halt the use of antibiotics for growth promotion from 2006 onwards."
"Allow me a few words on the controversial issue on which views were divided for a long time."
"I am referring to coccidiostats, which are substances used to prevent coccidia infections."
"I just want to stress that the proposal contains stricter rules for their authorisation and placing on the market, and they are kept within the scope of this Regulation."
"The reason for this is that hygiene precaution and improved husbandry practices are not sufficient to keep poultry free from such diseases."
"In order to ensure the safety of these substances, I am proposing a re-evaluation of current authorisations within four years of the entry into force of this Regulation."
"I also accept the request for a report to the Parliament and Council before 1 January 2008, on the use of these substances as feed additives together, where appropriate, with a legislative proposal concerning further use within the time limits as established in Amendment No 14."
"I fully agree with the solution finally reached by Parliament in order to impose a close follow-up of the use of coccidiostats and histomonostats."
"I can give an assurance that the Commission will propose measures in order to decide the future status of these substances."
"Parliament also proposed some flexibility on the labelling requirements applicable to flavouring compounds."
"I can agree to this change as I am convinced that this type of discussion should be made in the framework of the labelling of feed."
"A full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to the Parliament, and I trust that this will be included in the record for this session"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as time goes by, we in this Parliament find ourselves passing into law many proposals for legislation introduced by the Commission following on from its White Paper on Food Safety."
"In so doing, we are making a vital contribution to the improvement of EU law on food and feedingstuffs, while also ensuring that Europe's consumers recover their confidence - which had been lost -in the safety of their food."
"This case is no different."
"Both Parliament and the Council are agreed that the essential significance of this draft regulation is that, from 1 January 2006 onwards, antibiotics will, once and for all, be banned as additives in animal feed."
"What Parliament has been calling for for years, this regulation is now bringing to pass."
"Let me now turn, though, to the specific aspects that have concerned us in the course of second reading."
"Today's vote presents us with two alternatives - firstly, the amendments voted on in the committee, and, secondly, the compromise amendments negotiated by the rapporteur with the Council and the Commission, which are intended to make a long and laborious conciliation procedure unnecessary."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to support the compromise, and we did not exactly find that easy, having agreed in the committee that coccidiostats and histomonostats - the fundamental bone of contention between Parliament and the Council - would be permitted only until the end of 2008, which position was not - as is well known - supported by a majority on the Council."
"These substances are of great importance in poultry farming, and I have to say that I have no interest in banning their use."
"On the contrary, they must, in future, be removed from the category of additives to feedingstuffs and be categorised as subject to the legislation on veterinary medicines."
"Only thus can they be administered in a controlled way through prescription by a veterinary surgeon who knows the situation in the farm in question and can respond to it in an appropriate way."
"Failing that, the generalised prophylactic use of these substances - some of which are antibiotics - may well cover up any hygiene problems that exist on farms and in businesses."
"It was therefore of primary importance to us that we should today come to a decision in principle on what is to be done about coccidiostats and histomonostats, and, in this, the sequence of events was, ultimately, of only secondary importance."
"Compromise Amendment No 16 fixes a date for the cessation of the use of these substances as additives to feedingstuffs, that being December 2012, and, when seen in comparison with the Common Position, that amounts to major progress."
"We would certainly have liked to see them stop being used at an earlier date, but, even after the compromise has been reached, that is still possible, if - as the same amendment states - we ask the Commission, in January 2008, for a report and a legislative proposal."
"Should further progress have been made by then on the development of usable alternatives, we will then be able to agree with the Commission and the Council on an earlier date for the cessation of use."
"By adopting the compromise and by refraining from a conciliation procedure, Parliament has demonstrated that it is willing to cooperate, and let me make it perfectly clear at this juncture that we expect the same willingness to cooperate from the Commission and the Council at the consultations scheduled for 2008."
"The Council has met us halfway as regards another point, namely the labelling of flavourings."
"In this regard, we take the view that it is necessary to have a rule that is in line with the provisions applicable to flavourings used in the production of food."
"Why more stringent standards should apply in the area of animal nutrition than do in the field of food production, is incomprehensible."
"Should there be, though, in future, provisions on food that impose the labelling of all ingredients of flavourings, we will, of course, also have to apply them to feedingstuffs."
"Mr President, the requirements for agriculture to become environmentally-friendly and species-friendly are a matter of general knowledge; implementing them demands that we convert to methods of cultivation, rearing and feeding that are as close to nature as possible."
"In this chain, the food market is vigorously contended for, and distorted, by businesses operating on a national and international scale."
"That has an effect on almost all feed proteins and on additives."
"What happens to a farmer at the feed market is exactly the same as what happens to the consumer at the meat counter."
"Both have to be able to rely on what is inside the pack of meat, or the sack of feed, being what it says on the outside."
"It is, unfortunately, not yet universally known that what you feed to animals you end up feeding to humans."
"That is what makes the forthcoming general overhaul of the densely entangled European legislation in this area not only absolutely necessary but also, I think, overdue, even though, when it comes to additives to feedingstuffs, it is important to consider not only the effect of appetite stimulants or of growth promoters on the animals and hence on the farm's viability, but also the complex side-effects of such substances."
"Any risk of detriment to human health or to the environment must be excluded as far as possible."
"Only thus will it be possible to regain the consumers' confidence in the safety of foodstuffs of animal origin, a confidence shattered by the events associated with BSE, dioxin and antibiotics."
"It is that with which this regulation concerns itself, as does the committee's position, which I endorse."
"Even though voices are raised to assert that the large-scale banning of antibiotics from the feeding-trough is excessive, since some 90% of antibiotics are used in human and veterinary medicine, it is right that we should put a stop to growth promotion, as these antibiotics are far from being essential."
"We already have enough problems with the increasing number of people developing resistance to antibiotics."
"I too have some criticisms to make at this point."
"On 7 March this year I submitted a written question to the Council on the banning of the additive Nifursol."
"To this day, I have received no reply, even though Parliament's administration has pressed for one on two occasions."
"Nifursol, an aromatic nitrogen compound, was the last remaining prophylactic agent against blackhead disease in turkeys, and it appears that no medication is now licensed for the treatment of this disease."
"There are no alternatives, and there is no prospect of a vaccine."
"The reason why Nifursol was banned was that the EU classed it as carcinogenic."
"According to interim findings published by the Austrian health ministry on 16 June, no harmful residues have been found to date as a result of the testing of turkeys from food markets."
"If that result is confirmed, then prohibitions to protect human health may no longer be proportionate even under the broad terms of the European Court of Justice's ruling of 11 September 2002."
"The ban on Nifursol may end up being re-examined."
"Feedingstuffs that are guaranteed to be safe, as well as transparency in the production of food, demand that policy decisions be justified by science and taken on the basis of findings; they should not be rushed through in response to suspicions."
"For me, as a matter of principle, farmers must be at the centre of these decisions rather than on their margins!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance naturally support the policy of ceasing to add antibiotics to feed."
"This is an old demand by Parliament, and the ban might certainly already have been imposed years ago, but we wish to commend the process we are now completing."
"I must also take this opportunity to show respect for the Commission for having complied with this request by Parliament."
"We are part-way through the codecision procedure, and that gives me the opportunity to refer nonetheless to a number of reservations."
"Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, in your first reports, you had proposed a tougher approach to the registration of manufactured substances and to the timing of such registration, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did of course fall in with this proposal."
"In particular, you had initially recommended that coccidiostats be phased out by 2008."
"This has now been postponed to 2012 and not even, as yet, with a view to banning them definitively but rather with a view possibly to categorising them as medicines."
"That seems to me to be a very long wait."
"Why can they not be transferred into the medicines category before that?"
"Not that doing so would necessarily justify a ban."
"I have the impression that, in moving in that direction, you have been considerably influenced by the industry concerned."
"In the throes of a codecision procedure, a large group like the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has the opportunity of using its large quantity of votes to prevent us from obtaining the 314 votes we need and, through preferential negotiations, has the considerable power to land Parliament with results that we cannot then alter."
"In saying this, I would indicate that codecision does not necessarily always produce good results."
"Instead, it must be taken seriously and handled responsibly, and - above all, in the large group - there should be no getting carried away into complying with the interests of the industry."
"Nonetheless, we shall endorse this report, and I hope that you will reconsider whether it might not, however, be possible for your group also to support what has been decided by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the subject of registering manufactured substances."
"Mr President, I commence by complimenting the rapporteur, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, for her very practical and responsible approach to this important subject."
"I welcome the fact that the newly established European Food Safety Authority will play a key role in assessing applications for authorisation."
"This represents another step in the important work of rebuilding the confidence of European consumers in the quality and safety of European food products - as the Commissioner has often said - 'from farm to fork'."
"The lessons of the past have been learned and tremendous care has been taken to ensure that every link in the food chain is checked for soundness."
"Commissioner Byrne and his officials deserve great credit for their untiring efforts in this respect."
"I welcome the fact that authorisation of an additive will be valid for a maximum of ten years."
"It is necessary constantly to review regulation in this area, as new scientific evidence and testing is constantly being developed."
"Based on advice from the Scientific Steering Committee, it is appropriate that an adequate transitional period be laid down for the phasing out of the remaining antibiotics currently used in compounds for disease prevention. This should allow animal production practices to be adopted and the antibiotics to be replaced by alternative products."
"Livestock production occupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Community."
"Our farming and food production sector is facing great uncertainty at the moment and we must be vigilant in ensuring that any steps we propose serve to enhance the position of these crucial industries."
"I can only say that I wish that Commissioner Byrne's colleague, Mr Fischler, would demonstrate the same willingness to understand the difficulties currently faced by European farmers."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that satisfactory results in relation to this issue depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good quality feedingstuffs."
"The free movement of safe and wholesome food and feed is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and wellbeing of citizens and their social and economic interests."
"Mr President, as I look around the Chamber this morning, I am 200 miles from home but I do not feel as if I am in another country; instead, I feel as if I am on another planet."
"Certainly, when I try to explain to the small farmers what is happening here, they look at me as if I do come from that planet."
"Exploring these regulations and their proposed amendments, it is clear that the underlying ethos is the control of corporate business, itself a reasonable objective in a sector which has had more than its fair share of problems."
"What the authors of these regulations have clearly failed to recognise, however, is that many small and medium-sized livestock and poultry farmers and many family businesses also formulate feeds."
"Some of these enterprises operate on an extremely small scale and make up in flexibility, innovation and quality what they lose in economies of scale."
"None of these businesses can hope to deal with the complexities of this regulation, the paperwork, the recordings and the inspections - and they will progressively be driven out of the feed industry."
"They and their customers are either going out of business completely or are being forced to rely on the corporate feed producers whom they would normally wish to avoid."
"Once again, therefore, this Parliament, with its mania for regulations and its one-size-fits-all mentality, is obstructing the very things many of its Members profess to support: variety, diversity and quality, to say nothing of support for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I voted against these regulations at the first reading and if I thought it could succeed, I would have tabled an amendment to strike out the common position."
"As it is, I can only leave colleagues to make their own judgements as to the efforts made."
"I suspect they will not be that charitable."
"Mr President, Mr Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, overall, I approve the recommendations of our rapporteur, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, on the subject of additives in animal nutrition."
"It is obvious that we must move towards eliminating these antibiotics, coyly referred to as 'growth promoters' and systematically added to certain animal feeds."
"If the use of these antibiotics becomes commonplace, there is a risk that resistance to antibiotics will develop, and this would be undesirable and dangerous to human health."
"On the other hand, it does not appear to be necessary to ban coccidiostats, which remain essential in poultry farming, and on this point I support the latest provisions proposed by our rapporteur."
"As for the issues raised regarding labelling, I am of the opinion that they cannot be resolved merely by regulation, and that the crucial factor is the trust that exists between the manufacturer of the feeds and the livestock farmer who uses them."
"I should like to use this debate on additives in animal nutrition as an opportunity to remind the House that the feeding of farm animals using compound feeds produced industrially is not, fortunately, the norm."
"Ruminants, such as sheep, dairy cows and suckler cows, are for the most part fed on the products of the farm itself."
"In the case of laying hens, over 25% of their feed is produced on the farm."
"It is only in the case of table poultry and pigs that, in some regions, feeding is now almost totally dependent on outsourced industrial products."
"I think we ought to ask ourselves whether this development is advisable."
"Obviously it is in the interests of a powerful industry, but is it in the interests of the consumer?"
"Is it in the interests of the farmer?"
"Is it in the interests of the environment?"
"Is it in the interests of society as a whole, and is it in the interests of animal welfare?"
"It seems to me that in all five cases the answer is 'no', and that, on the contrary, common sense tells us that it is preferable for farm animals to eat farm-produced products."
"For consumers it would be more reassuring to know that they are eating animal products, such as milk, meat and eggs, which come from animals fed on farm products rather than industrial products."
"It is a question of image, of taste, of traceability and, of course, of food safety too, because farmers would never, of their own volition, have fed their cows on meat meals."
"For the farmer, it would be a way of obtaining more added value for his product and of avoiding two lots of transactions, namely the sale of his plant products and the purchase of his compound feeds."
"It would also enable him to improve his image and go up-market."
"Our environment would benefit from the obvious saving in terms of transport: the lorry that comes to the farm to collect the maize or forage peas being sold, and the one that comes to deliver the compound feed."
"As for society as a whole, the great advantage that we could expect would be a reduction in that huge deficit in vegetable proteins which threatens our food safety, by the replacement of imported soya by locally-produced oil and protein crops."
"I would also add that, if agri-environmental aid were granted to farms producing such crops for consumption by their own animals, it should be easy to gain acceptance for such a measure under the 'Green Box' so dear to Mr Fischler's heart."
"Finally, from the point of view of animal welfare, it would mean the animals spending more time out at pasture, and a fresher, healthier and more varied diet."
"It would perhaps be a good idea then, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without, of course, denying the usefulness of adopting legislation on additives in animal nutrition, for the European Union and the Member States to expend more energy on encouraging the feeding of animals on farm-produced feeds than on regulating and controlling the production of industrially manufactured feeds."
"Mr President, current legislation on additives in animal nutrition is complex."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that a proposal has been tabled which reduces the existing chaos into a readily understood format."
"We agree wholeheartedly that the rules for additives in animal nutrition should become strict and unambiguous."
"This is certainly necessary."
"After all, this is about protecting the lives and health of humans and animals."
"It is important, though, that sound alternative products are available."
"Where these alternatives are not available, we need to exercise some flexibility."
"This is why we back the amendments which permit coccidiostatica and histomonostatica for longer than other antibiotics. This is because at present, there are certain diseases in poultry farming which are difficult to fight without these additives."
"I am certainly not, however, advocating the unlimited use of coccidiostatica."
"Although the transitional period is somewhat limited, we assume that the feed industry and poultry farming will find sound alternatives to these substances within that time."
"We are struggling with Amendments Nos 10 and 13 which exclude mixtures and premixtures containing flavourings and appetite stimulants from the labelling requirement."
"The argument of the economic drawbacks for the industry does not, in our view, carry more weight than the interests of humans and animals, which are at stake here."
"Indeed, consumers benefit from clear and extensive labelling of the product so that they know exactly what is in it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the report (A5-0171/2003) by Mr Lisi, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on a Community Action Plan for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean Sea under the Common Fisheries Policy [COM(2002) 535 - C5-0623/2002 - 2002/2281(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we received with great interest the Commission communication on a Community Action Plan for fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea."
"This communication responds to a frequently expressed demand which is wholly legitimate, given both the importance of the Mediterranean fishing economy for the European Union and the specific nature of fisheries in the Mediterranean region."
"The current regulation on fisheries in the Mediterranean - Regulation 1626/94 - has thus far survived only thanks to derogations which, although, on the one hand, have made it possible to save the unsaveable, as in the case of special fisheries, have, on the other, served first and foremost to highlight the inadequacy of the Union's approach to the Mediterranean question."
"Indeed, we all know that applying the principles of the common fisheries policy exactly as it stands is counterproductive to the Mediterranean and can even, at times, be harmful if we consider the socio-economic consequences."
"That is why I welcome with particular satisfaction the Commission's endeavour, this endeavour to establish the specific nature of the Mediterranean and the sustainability of fisheries resources as new criteria in the future action plan."
"There are many positive aspects of the communication, such as, for example, the delegation to the Member States of responsibility for managing coastal fishing, the involvement of fishermen's associations, dialogue with third countries and the consideration given for the first time to leisure fishing."
"Nevertheless, following a proper analysis of the sector and its specific characteristics carried out by the Commission with regard to the solutions, the rapporteur and our Parliamentary committee feel that not enough effort has been made to find imaginative solutions and avoid recourse to conventional CFP - common policy - instruments, whereas, for the Mediterranean we need an innovative, coherent, step-by-step measure whose thrust can be altered whenever it is deemed necessary."
"I would now like to draw your attention briefly to a number of points contained in my report."
"Firstly, the Union's systematic, multilateral approach must be a reality, not just wishful thinking."
"Involving fishermen's associations must include promoting the experiments carried out at local level with a view to responsible management, experiments which demonstrate the effectiveness of the selective equipment used and the effectiveness of alternative ways of managing the fishing effort, such as, for example, temporary closures."
"Rigidly and systematically transposing CFP management mechanisms such as minimum sizes or TACs is liable to negate fishermen's determined efforts and could prove to be counterproductive."
"Moreover, premature implementation of inadequate technical measures would be liable to render ineffective the multilateral dialogue which the Commission plans to hold with the third countries of the Mediterranean region with a view to the sustainable management of the Basin as a whole."
"What we want is for the negotiations with countries which, like us, fish the Mediterranean Sea to be undertaken as soon as possible, so that we can submit the results of these talks to the forthcoming Mediterranean Interministerial Conference on fisheries due to take place in Venice in November 2003."
"The second point is the emphasis placed on the fundamental role of research to support an effective fisheries policy."
"As we know, from this point of view, the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean have always represented a problem, but we must emphasise the need for scientific research to be relevant to the action plan."
"It is in this regard that we propose a Mediterranean research model based on local data-collection networks."
"Then there are the structural implications of the action plan, which we feel the Commission has underestimated somewhat."
"In particular, we consider the part dedicated to this point to be unsatisfactory."
"As a committee, we propose to evaluate, in cases such as this one, not least, innovative support measures, particularly the measure extending the de minimis rule to the fisheries sector."
"It must certainly not be forgotten that 80% of Mediterranean fishing is small-scale and tied closely to the areas concerned, whose socio-economic equilibrium verges, more often than not, on mere subsistence."
"Lastly, Mr President, there is the line taken by the Commission on the environment."
"It appears to us to be somewhat incomplete in that it does not acknowledge that fishermen are more often victims of, rather than responsible for, environmental damage."
"In a region where genuinely coastal fishing predominates, the key to sustainable coexistence remains, in any case, the integrated management of coastal areas, an aspect to which the Commission fails to give sufficient emphasis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by thanking my colleagues from the Committee on Fisheries for their extremely helpful suggestions, which allowed us ultimately to achieve unanimous consensus on the report."
". Mr President, I am pleased to see that Parliament endorses the approach proposed by the Commission."
"It is true, as is highlighted in the report, that the Commission has conceived an ambitious plan, but this is warranted by the importance and complexity of Mediterranean fisheries. The Community must do its utmost to deliver sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean."
"Many fishermen's associations, public opinion and the European Parliament too have repeatedly requested a more stringent, reliable and strategic common fisheries policy in the Mediterranean."
"The plan will respond to this challenge and, if properly implemented and supported by our Member States, it will allow us to achieve the main goal of reconciling fisheries with conservation of exploited resources and the environment within a framework of economic and social sustainability."
"We are worried about the state of resources and sustainability of fisheries in the area."
"Both the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of the Commission have underlined the poor state of some of the species in the area."
"There are clear signals that the fisheries are not properly exploiting the production potential of the resources."
"In addition, the poor economic performance of several important Mediterranean fleets means that the current exploitation pattern needs to be revised."
"The Commission will make use of all the management tools available on the basis of scientific advice."
"Even though effort management, together with improved control of fishing capacity, is likely to be the most appropriate tool for Mediterranean fisheries, it is undeniable that improving technical measures is also necessary."
"The Commission has already started work on a proposal to improve the technical measures to achieve better protection of juveniles, of habitats and, in general terms, of biodiversity."
"We have already convened two meetings on 19 May and 16-17 June 2003 to discuss this measure with the fishing industry."
"Improved dialogue with the industry will allow the Commission to adopt quite soon a proposal on technical measures that takes into consideration the expertise of the sector."
"Immediately after the adoption of the technical measures package, the Commission will start to address the fishing effort issue and I hope that a formal proposal could be put forward early in 2004."
"However, we are well aware that all our efforts could be wasted if we do not establish cooperative management with the other Mediterranean countries."
"There are many international waters with open access."
"In addition, the trawlable shelf extends well beyond territorial waters. This means that the Community must work together with Mediterranean third countries to establish harmonised measures and to freeze or reduce the fishing capacity operation in certain shared areas."
"We are well advanced in the organisation of a ministerial conference in Venice scheduled for 25-26 November 2003."
"That should hopefully deliver a further boost to multilateral cooperation in fisheries."
"However, as the biggest fisheries player in the area, we have a responsibility to lead the process and to promote responsible fisheries, first of all, on our own side."
"Establishing so-called fishing protection zones is, in the Commission's view, a necessary move to improve control and fairness in international waters, as well as to create an international framework to deliver responsible fisheries and to ensure conservation of straddling and transnational stocks."
"This should enhance multilateral cooperation without prejudice to the historical rights of our fishermen and the legitimate aspirations of the other bordering countries."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, on the report he has prepared, and in particular on his will and his way of working, which has enabled the other members of the Committee on Fisheries, as he said himself, to enter into a fruitful and positive dialogue when drawing up this report."
"The Mediterranean, which is the cradle of European civilisation, is a responsive, living, but extremely fragile place, characterised by its status as an enclosed sea, which brings its own dangers."
"There are therefore no easy solutions to problems such as industrial pollution - as the rapporteur himself pointed out - or pollution due to high demographic density."
"The Action Plan presented by the European Commission is necessary."
"We need an all-embracing Action Plan that is not restricted to fishing methods, because nobody could believe that the current scarcity of fish is due solely to overfishing."
"It is due rather to a combination of factors, mainly marine pollution due to agricultural pesticides reaching the sea, oil slicks and everyday leaks from oil tankers, and the lack of purifying plants for treating sewage."
"We therefore urgently need to adopt measures o combat industrial and urban pollution in the Mediterranean."
"We also need to put a stop to the infringements of the common fisheries policy that currently take place, such as illegal fishing, the use of illegal methods, parallel trading and lack of compliance with standards relating to minimum size."
"The Mediterranean fishing sector is fragile."
"Its fleet - as we have already heard - essentially comprises small-scale fishing boats."
"The sector therefore needs the continued support of the public authorities if it is to develop in a controlled manner without growth for some leading to bankruptcy for others."
"This applies equally to the small-scale fishing fleet, aquaculture - a growing industry - or marketing."
"As the Commissioner has pointed out, the characteristics of the Mediterranean are highly specific."
"Around twenty countries - most of which are not EU Members - as well as world fleets operate in this area, such as the Japanese and Russian fleets."
"The Community needs to ensure, in conjunction with the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean, that all parties comply with the principles of the common fisheries policy with regard to the Mediterranean."
"Without sustainable management of resources, the days of fishing in the Mediterranean are numbered, as this area provides a livelihood for almost half the workers in the Community fishing sector and half the European fleet."
"As Mr Lisi has pointed out, the fishing sector in the Mediterranean employs a large workforce and has a positive effect on other sectors, such as tourism."
"Poor application of the principle of subsidiarity - and this is perhaps the strongest objection I would put to Mr Lisi - resulting in the renationalisation of the CFP, would be a death sentence for fishing in the Mediterranean."
"I therefore believe we urgently need to apply the CFP in its entirety in the Mediterranean, adapting it to the reality of the Mediterranean situation and considering in advance, where we feel it necessary, what exactly are the prevailing conditions in this area."
"We need to adapt the fleet to existing resources, but we cannot - and here I agree with Mr Lisi - sentence it to ruin, as might happen if aid for renovating the fleet was discontinued."
"The ageing of the fleet would lead to the end of fishing in the Mediterranean, as surely as if there were no more fish."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists - and I should make this clear - supports the Action Plan presented by the Commission, which should be implemented with the utmost regard for the special characteristics of the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I believe we are all agreed that the sustainability of salt-water fisheries resources, and provisions to maintain it, are essential for the fisheries sector."
"A common fisheries policy (CFP) cannot, however, be blindly applied: it must take account of local and regional variations between different fisheries, fleets and regions of the Member States dependent on this sector, and the populations involved."
"For that reason, a degree of participation on the part of fishermen and their associations is essential. Their experience is vital."
"This requirement also means, however, that if the CFP is to be correctly applied, it is essential to guarantee flexibility for Member States in the application of measures for the management of the fishing effort. We must take into account experimental local projects developed by the fishermen themselves."
"The rapporteur mentions such projects in the Mediterranean. This also suggests that the Member States should be able to enforce conservation measures themselves, since it is they who know most about the state of resources."
"Another point relates to promoting research, since measures to conserve and evaluate the state of resources should be taken on the basis of sound scientific opinion, with the participation of fishermen and their associations."
"In order to achieve that, it is necessary to promote research, a step the rapporteur also proposes for the Mediterranean in his report."
"We are also in favour of delegating the responsibility for coastal and other fisheries management to Member States, as well as encouraging the discovery of solutions on a local level. The aim of this, with the principle of subsidiarity in mind, is to reduce the fishing effort."
"I feel that this is a good path to follow in other areas, such as the Atlantic."
"In Portugal, for example, as in the Mediterranean, small-scale coastal and non-industrial fishing is very important."
"While I concur with the rapporteur's argument that we need to take measures specifically to support such fishing, just as I argued for that need when the 2003 fisheries budget appeared, I would emphasise the need for the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance to help small-scale fishing."
"I would also emphasise the importance of considering, for various parts of the Atlantic, and in particular for the 200-mile-long Portuguese coast and island territories, identical measures for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of salt-water fisheries resources to those I upheld for the Mediterranean."
"I would also like to emphasise, as did the rapporteur, that the decline of fisheries has other causes, notably pollution and sea transport. The sector is therefore often a victim of these phenomena."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are keen to emphasise the importance of this special report on the common fisheries policy, because it highlights the special situation of the Mediterranean fisheries."
"I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent quality of his work."
"The Mediterranean is a semi-enclosed sea."
"It forms an ecosystem, an entity in its own right, rich in its environment and in its culture."
"The problems involving the Mediterranean must be solved in the context of multilateral relations and the MEDA programmes, for which I am the rapporteur and which are true instruments of the European Union, set up by the 1995 Barcelona Convention, making it possible to take action from the point of view of sustainable development."
"MEDA must also take into account the economic, technical and environmental problems relating to fisheries."
"I should like to emphasise several points which are raised in Mr Lisi's report and which I believe to be of major importance."
"First of all, in order to gain a knowledge of the region, it is essential to carry out a survey of the environment, the treatment of waste water, the development of coastal belts and the development of fisheries resources."
"In order to do this, considerable investment will have to be agreed on rapidly, to enable scientific research programmes to be implemented concerning the state of fish stocks and the prospects for development as a function of pressure from fishing."
"Secondly, fishing techniques must be studied in order to decide which ones are most suitable, taking into account, in particular, the size of the fish, which are often smaller in the Mediterranean than elsewhere, and smaller fish do not necessarily mean juveniles."
"Thirdly, we must protect and promote small-scale fishing, by which I mean non-industrial fishing, which is often coastal fishing and which is an important source of jobs besides treating fisheries resources with greater care than industrial fishing does."
"Fourthly, fishing is an occupation with many motivated and competent people in responsible positions, people who are highly experienced and who are concerned with preserving the ethics of fishing, and who do not hesitate to share their extremely interesting local experiences so that lessons may be learned from them."
"Regional fisheries committees, which serve as centres of consultation, and which take into account the needs of the profession, should be encouraged."
"Finally, as regards the Mediterranean Sea itself and the coastal lagoons, as well as the wetlands around them, we must seek to ensure greater respect for the environment so that fishing can continue to develop, particularly in the lagoons, such as the Etang de Thau, whose Category A status it is absolutely essential to preserve."
"Only in this way is it possible to allow the continuation of extensive fishing, constantly taking into account health criteria which correspond to an environment of excellent quality, thereby avoiding any deterioration which would certainly occur if we encouraged only activities taking place out of the water, in particular the cleaning of shellfish."
"Mr President, the Community Action Plan for fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea presented by the Commission is an initial major step towards sustainable management of the sector."
"However, what we have here are a series of good intentions which, although we do not fully support them, need to be implemented with some urgency."
"A number of points, rightly emphasised in Mr Lisi's report - and I would like to congratulate Mr Lisi - are particularly important."
"The Commission rightly considers that one of the key elements to bear in mind, with a view to a sustainable approach to fisheries in the Mediterranean Basin, is the specific nature of the Mediterranean itself."
"Quite right."
"I would point out that the principal areas of reproduction and repopulation of many - not all - species of fish in the Mediterranean are concentrated in the coastal areas."
"On behalf of the UEN Group, I can therefore only welcome the European Commission's proposal providing for delegation to the Member States of responsibility for managing coastal fishing."
"I would also point out that another specific characteristic of the Mediterranean Sea - a relatively small, warm sea compared to the northern seas - is the fact that few single-species schools of fish are formed. Precisely for this reason - and here I am disassociating myself from the Commission's proposal - I feel that the Mediterranean fisheries system does not lend itself to the effective implementation of TACs and quotas."
"We support the Commission's line on enhancing and improving scientific research in the Mediterranean and involving fishermen's associations in key decisions in the fisheries sector: these are points of primary importance which I am afraid it is not possible to go into in more depth here."
"I would, however, like to highlight the excellent proposal to allow professional organisations to participate in the future Advisory Council for the Mediterranean which we hope to see established."
"In conclusion, still on the subject of the specific nature of the Mediterranean, I would like to emphasise a point which is genuinely important and crucial for the sector's economy, a point which certainly applies to Italy in any case. We must make every endeavour to support the small-scale fishing, the traditional fishing which, in addition to providing a vital source of employment for countless families, is the guardian of an age-old tradition which Europe must protect and safeguard."
"Mr President, I apologise for being a bit croaky. I have made so many speeches over the last week I am losing my voice, although some people would regard that as a blessing."
"First of all I congratulate Giorgio Lisi for his excellent report."
"Embracing the Mediterranean within the controls and regulations of the common fisheries policy is a very ambitious plan and one which I hope will secure the core objectives of conservation and sustainability."
"However, to do so we first must learn the lesson from past failures of the common fisheries policy."
"We do not need to search far for these failures: for the past year we have been dealing with crisis after crisis."
"The Commission itself, in the opening lines of its CFP reform document, acknowledges that the policy has been deeply flawed."
"Where the main objective of the CFP has been to sustain employment in the sector and to sustain fish stocks we have failed miserably on both counts."
"We are now dealing with estimated job losses in excess of 40 000 around the North Sea alone, with hundreds of fishermen leaving the industry and scrapping their vessels, and fish stocks across the major whitefish species showing signs of imminent collapse."
"The reasons for these problems are of course manifold: overfishing has indeed played its part, but so have environmental pollution, global warming, North Atlantic drift, and many other factors."
"However, the strict regime of TACs and quotas has itself exacerbated the problem of discards, with over 25% of healthy fish being thrown dead back into the sea every year."
"A Commission official told our committee last week that an estimated 150 000 tonnes of fresh healthy haddock were dumped dead back into the North Sea last year."
"This is an utter tragedy and completely unsustainable."
"Similarly, the problems of illegal fishing - black fish landings - have made the situation even worse."
"We must not allow these problems to be imported into the Mediterranean under the CFP."
"Of course, we have an initial difficulty - and a very large one at that - because the majority of countries fishing in the Mediterranean are not EU Member States, so we must seek their active cooperation in achieving our conservation and sustainable exploitation objectives."
"It would be untenable to impose a strict regime of regulations and controls on our own fleet while allowing vessels from other nations to plunder the seas unhindered."
"The very nature of the fishing sector around the Mediterranean is unique: few people realise for example that the Italian fleet is the second largest in the EU, with over 17 000 vessels."
"98% of these, however, are under 12 metres in length, which means the main fishery is being prosecuted in inshore waters and is of a largely artisanal nature."
"Many of these craft are old and are becoming increasingly unsafe, so we need to look at the modernisation of these vessels on health and safety grounds alone."
"I also welcome the recommendations from Mr Lisi that we should closely monitor leisure fishing."
"This is an increasingly important area and it provides many jobs in the tourist sector, the value of which we cannot underestimate."
"It would be ludicrous, however, to ignore the impact such activities have on the fisheries sector and on fish stocks."
"Finally, I am very much in favour of the multilateral approach to fisheries management in the Mediterranean in future."
"This is the only way in which we can involve all of the actors and stakeholders in the formulation of sensible management proposals for a sustainable Mediterranean fishery."
"I hope your vocal chords recover soon, Mr Stevenson."
"Seeing as we are talking about fisheries, I would like to make a suggestion."
"I am not a doctor, but I think you should do as the fish do for two or three days: remain silent."
"That will cure you for sure!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not croaky, I am glad to say, but my voice does quaver a little when I speak of the Mediterranean, which beckons us towards the sun, beaches, and holidays."
"The climatic, physical, cultural and political history of the Mediterranean is very rich and complex."
"I read recently that it dried up completely five thousand years ago, as demonstrated by the layers of salt on the sea floor."
"Admittedly, the pressures of tourism, the population explosion in northern Africa and pollution do not currently threaten this beautiful sea as gravely as did that climatic disaster which dried it up completely."
"There is nevertheless a risk of overfishing in many parts of the Mediterranean."
"The most rigorous scientific research says as much, though there is as yet no scientifically proven risk of a collapse in fish stocks."
"While there is admittedly no risk of collapse, then, there are threats nevertheless, and it is to be feared that resources in the Mediterranean may suffer the same decline as has occurred in other maritime regions."
"That is why it is necessary to take action."
"It is a good principle, one which could eventually be applied at points on the Atlantic rim, such as the coast of Portugal, for example. The obstacles placed by the rapporteur in the way of implementing the main tools of conservation policy, however, especially total allowable catches (TAC) and quotas, raise some doubts in my mind."
"The objections brought by the rapporteur to the introduction of minimum landing sizes are also debateable."
"The reference to the special character of Mediterranean fisheries is legitimate, but seems almost to have become for some a pretext for maintaining the current status quo."
"Research is the magic word, but it is also used to defer decisions that demand to be taken straight away."
"In point of fact, though, research must indeed be a priority for the European Union, and organisations under its umbrella, if errors are not to be made in future regarding the state of fisheries resources and marine biodiversity."
"A more balanced and rational study of salt-water fisheries resources in the Mediterranean is needed. That much is indisputable."
"At this point, however, after hearing the speeches made by my fellow Members, I continue to entertain doubts about whether we should apply the current Atlantic common fisheries policy (CFP) to the Mediterranean, or whether we should, on the contrary, apply the Mediterranean model to the Atlantic ?"
"This is a highly controversial issue which we should perhaps examine in depth rather than superficially, since what has finally come to light today, after the speeches we have heard, is that the current CFP model is misguided, and the existing Mediterranean model is the one which may eventually come to be adopted."
"Is this claim true or false?"
"It certainly constitutes a challenge."
"As the Commission says, the one thing of which we can now be certain is that the Mediterranean lacks regulations allowing the same levels of development to be achieved, and attaching the same high priority to this issue, as in other parts of the Community."
"It is not even true to say that a few specific elements are necessary."
"Who is right?"
"This answer to this question is very important if we are to resolve doubts over whether some of the speeches made on the subject of the Mediterranean are not designed purely and simply to maintain the status quo."
"Mr President, it was not until the end of 2002 that the Commission adopted an Action Plan aimed at ensuring the sustainability of fishing in the Mediterranean."
"One might say that it was not before time, and Mr Lisi's excellent own-initiative report emphasises the various positive aspects of this plan, at the same time highlighting those points that seem to him to be inadequate, or those that seem to him to be the most important."
"Thus he points out, rightly, that before any restrictive measures are adopted, more in-depth studies should be carried out, leading to a precise evaluation of the current situation in the Mediterranean fishing areas."
"That evaluation should tackle every aspect of fishing activity, including its biological, economic, social, technological, cultural and even anthropological aspects."
"Such an evaluation would also have to be on-going."
"Mr Lisi, also following the Commission's plan, emphasises, again rightly, the fact that the Mediterranean ecosystem has a certain unity, which means that the issue has to be dealt with on a multilateral basis."
"There are currently six Member States bordering on the Mediterranean, if we take into account the accession of Malta and Cyprus, and that means that the Union will carry very considerable weight in any future negotiations."
"That can be demonstrated in the context of the Barcelona process."
"Permit me to remind you that it was in Barcelona that the first congress was held, in 1999, on maritime technological innovations and research."
"The report emphasises the need for consultation with the people who are involved in fishing, who have organised themselves, and done a good job of it."
"They have modernised their fleet, and have adapted to change."
"All these efforts must be taken into account."
"They have often - almost always - done it with the aid of regional or autonomous authorities."
"That is the case in Catalonia and, I would say, in all the Catalan regions."
"It is important, therefore, that any regulatory action is taken in close consultation with the fishermen themselves, the institutions that they have formed, and the local, regional and autonomous authorities."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"We shall now adjourn until voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.10 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m.)"
"Mr President, we are shocked to learn that, in various countries, representatives of the Iranian opposition are setting themselves alight at a time when we receive the official Iranian representatives in this House."
"May I insist, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, that we side with those who, in Iran, uphold the values of human rights and democracy, so that acts of despair no longer take place?"
"I think your message is loud and clear, Mrs Maes, and we will ensure that it is understood."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I have to draw your attention to a serious irregularity: we are about to vote on the Terrón i Cusí report."
"At 10.50 a.m. this morning, it appeared that various translations of this report were not yet available."
"They are now available at 11 a.m., but this is far too late to vote on the report now."
"We will therefore have to respect the rules of this House and adjourn the vote until the Strasbourg sitting."
"Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues in both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Council and the Commission for their fantastically creative and constructive cooperation."
"It will mean quite large changes in Europe, and it will mean a lot for public health."
"There is, nonetheless, a small detail in all this that is incredibly important, namely the fight against resistance to antibiotics."
"I wish therefore to ask Commissioner Byrne to give us oral confirmation that the Commission takes this seriously and will table new proposals."
". Mr President, the Commission wishes to thank Mrs Paulsen for her support for this proposal and hopes that the compromise package discussed between the institutions will be accepted by Parliament."
"The Commission also notes with satisfaction the general support of this House for the package of proposals on zoonoses."
"As you probably know there have been delicate discussions with the Member States on this regulation, its scope, the timetable for implementation and its financial dimension."
"I also understand that some of you have expressed concerns in relation to the use of antibiotics in animal production and the related risk of development of resistance to anti-microbials."
"On 26 June 2001, the Commission adopted a Community strategy against anti-microbial resistance."
"This strategy comprises actions in all relevant sectors, including public health and the veterinary and phytosanitory sectors."
"In March 2002, the Commission proposed the total ban of antibiotics used for growth promotion from 2006."
"The European Parliament is today expected to decide on this prohibition."
"I hope that it will support that date of 2006, as it is foreseen in the common position and, indeed, was included in the Commission's original proposal."
"The Commission will also ask in the coming months for a European scientific evaluation of the use of antibiotics as medicines in the framework of salmonella control programmes, particularly in poultry."
"The Commission intends to take due account of scientific opinion in the actions to be taken."
"The regulation will be a well-balanced compromise. It will contribute to strengthening the Community approach to the control of salmonella and will certainly lead to a large decrease in the incidents of human salmonellosis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday and following long negotiations, the Council reached agreement on the statute for European political parties."
"We therefore have a major opportunity today of passing, at first reading, this law that is so important for democracy and transparency in Europe."
"If that is to be possible, we must, in the course of the codecision procedure, make the Council and Parliament texts compatible."
"All the compromise amendments before you fulfil this objective."
"Whoever, therefore, wants us today to take the momentous step of deciding upon this party statute must vote in favour of the compromise amendments and reject all the others."
"The translations had to be carried out very quickly between Monday and Wednesday."
"I would therefore ask Parliament's language service to check the text for compatibility with the Council's text, especially where the numbering is concerned, and also to add paragraph 3 of the Council's text, which we ourselves forgot about, to Amendment No 55."
"Parliament's services, and the Council, are very much aware of the numbering problem that you raised."
"The text will be aligned as you request."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on a point of order, I would like to emphasise, as Mr Leinen's speech confirms, and as I said yesterday, that we are introducing a new precedent today: we are going to approve amendments which have not been agreed on the basis of proposals suggested by my fellow Members, but a new type of amendment, negotiated with the Council."
"This is a new interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, a new innovation by Parliament."
"I therefore felt that the procedure defined in Rule 130a of the Rules of Procedure should have been followed."
"At this stage, however, I do not want to labour the point."
"It is the Bureau's decision and I can of course do no more than note this development."
"Mr President, my congratulations to Parliament and to all those who have also offered their help."
"This really is a good day for European democracy."
"There can be no European democracy without European political parties."
"As we also said in yesterday's discussion in connection with the constitution and the outcome of the Convention, this statute is an important step towards giving politics a fully European dimension."
"Allow me to thank all those who have offered their help: Mr Tsatsos and also Mrs Schleicher who, with this Parliament's reports, prepared the way years ago; and next, of course, the Commission, which submitted the draft law to us very quickly once the Treaty of Nice had come into effect."
"Most particularly, I should like to thank the Greek Presidency of the Council, for which this was quite a major commitment, and a very successful one."
"My sincere thanks to my Greek fellow MEPs."
"We have a lot of European statutes that are not yet operational."
"Today, we finally have one that can come into effect and that works."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to give colleagues a short update on where we stand on this important proposal."
"First, may I say that your vote today will mark a further substantial step forward in the delivery of reform of the European Commission."
"As you will recall from our previous debates, this reform of the staff regulations brings in the major revisions and restructuring of the employment conditions and career development for staff throughout the European institutions."
"Colleagues, when we had a debate here in Brussels on 27 March 2003, you were kind enough to give us your support for the amendments we proposed."
"However, we asked you to hold off from voting on the legislative resolution to give us the opportunity, as rapporteurs, to negotiate with the Council and the Commission to sustain Parliament's position."
"This is not an item of codecision, it is an item where we have an opinion."
"We have done that successfully and we now want you to vote on this substantially; we want to release the next stage of the discussion process - the convening of a consultation committee involving the Council, the Commission and representatives of staff and staff unions throughout the institutions."
"So please, support this today."
"The amendments we are tabling reflect the current negotiating position and ask the Council and the Commission to bring back to us further changes that they will make beyond the original proposal."
"We will be returning to you with two further reports in a few months' time to confirm the whole process."
"Mr President, to reiterate what Mr Harbour has just said, we are now asking for the final vote on this proposal."
"As Mr Harbour said, the text is now at the stage of being discussed jointly by the staff and the institutions."
"A second proposal will then eventually come back to this House, containing aspects that were not included in the original proposal - I am referring to the entire pensions system, whose reform the Council evidently wishes to raise and on which Parliament would once again need to be consulted."
"The adoption of this text now enables us to express our initial position."
"In order to state our position on the definitive text, we would then need a second Council proposal."
"Mr President, I have here - and for relevant reasons - an oral amendment, with the new number 15 a. There is a problem in this connection, namely that the title of the agreement, which we wish to support in Parliament, is rather long."
"The amendment itself is short, and I only have the English text."
"In spite of that, I would ask the House, if possible, to facilitate a vote on it."
"I shall read out this amendment:"
"I understand, Mr Swoboda, that you have spoken to other political groups regarding this matter."
"Mr President, we support this oral proposal."
"Mr President, we would like to change the last twelve words of paragraph 20 by way of oral amendment to 'are issues which require a sustained dialogue between the transatlantic partners'."
"This is the oral amendment on behalf of the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I shall not take up much of the House's time."
"I would simply like to thank the staff very much for the speed with which they have worked."
"I would also like to thank the political groups for their capacity for dialogue on this issue of immigration, which is normally controversial but which requires the agreement of all of us in order to impose common sense and useful policies."
"Many thanks also to the spokesmen of the groups for their availability, which enabled us to vote on this report before the Thessaloniki Summit."
"Mr President, in Amendment No 6 to this report, Mrs Boudjenah proposes to add a sentence to paragraph 1."
"She stresses the important role of access to energy for development and suggests that we characterise access to energy as an essential human right."
"I am sympathetic to her reasoning, although I do not think we can make such a statement."
"Access to energy is not part of any human rights convention."
"I would, however, be prepared to replace 'essential human rights' by 'economic and social rights'."
"If the House agrees to such an oral amendment, I would then recommend that it support the amendment thus corrected."
"If not, I would advise the House to vote against the part of the amendment which refers to essential human rights."
"."
"(PT) The Olympic Games will be held on the territory of a Member State for the first time since the creation of the Schengen area and its integration into the Union framework."
"We have here a specific Community measure that sets out a system of derogation from the rules on the issue of visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens."
"The aim of this Regulation is to facilitate the task of the Member State entrusted with organising the next Olympic Games - Greece - while enabling it to fulfil the commitments made under the Olympic Charter."
"Temporary derogations from certain provisions of the acquis communautaire on visas are provided for; they are of limited scope, proportional, of a technical nature and fully justified by the exceptional character of the event."
"Members of the Olympic family who, because of their nationality, are subject to visa requirements will continue to be subject to those requirements."
"The intention is merely to facilitate the procedures for submitting applications and the form in which visas are issued (the Organising Committee will simply have to forward a list of participants to the services responsible for issuing visas in Greece). Neither is there any conflict with the basic principles or security rules of the Schengen area (the Greek authorities must check that all the requirements are fulfilled before a visa is issued)."
". British Conservatives fully support the values of the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004 but even under these very important circumstances we are unable to support the principle of a common visa policy."
"To a great extent I share the rapporteur's concerns regarding the need to simplify the visa application procedure for participants in the Athens Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2004."
"I also agree with her position on speeding up the entry and transit procedures on these occasions, without forgoing the security needed for situations of this kind."
"Indeed, as history has dramatically shown in the past, the Olympic Games, because of the media attention they enjoy, are prime targets for displays of extremism and violence; high levels of security are therefore essential."
"The adoption of a uniform short-stay, multiple-entry visa may lead to improvements in the processing of data, which will certainly make it easier for the organising country to keep track of and monitor entries and exits from its territory and the whole Schengen area."
"I think it appropriate that the Commission should prepare a prompt report, as recommended by the rapporteur, to help in assessing the functioning of the proposed system and allow it to be implemented at forthcoming events of this nature."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"The Mediterranean plays a highly significant part in the European Union fisheries sector."
"The Community's Mediterranean fleet, representing 22% of Union vessels in terms of tonnage, is clear evidence of that."
"In view of this, I voted in favour in order to support the rapporteur's position and to welcome the Commission's views in this Action Plan, especially when it refers to the specificity of the Mediterranean as an essential parameter in the ongoing reform."
"This perspective is made all the more relevant by the current discrepancy between the real importance of that specificity and the attention paid to it in the context of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"The rapporteur has drawn up a pertinent set of proposals which will contribute to a reasonable consideration of Mediterranean particularities and lead to the development of a model specific to the area."
"I particularly agree with the following proposals: the assessment of CFP impact in this area; the preference for the decentralised approach to local or self-management solutions, as is essential for sustainable fishing and full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity; the promotion of improvements in scientific research, and consequently the adaptation of the Action Plan to the conclusions drawn from the results achieved; and the rapid setting-up of negotiations with coastal third countries, as well as the involvement of countries which, although not Mediterranean themselves, have important strategic positions in this area, especially those that are Member States of the European Union."
". Although my vote was in favour of the Markov report, I wish to draw attention to the fact that paragraph 11, in supporting the assignation of the entire responsibility for the structural funds to a single authority and a single minister in each Member State, may be inconsistent with the arrangements in Member States that have federal or devolved administrations."
"I hope that the paragraph will be interpreted in a manner appropriate to these situations."
"Yet again we note, as does the report, the failure of the EU's regional policy and the lack of prospects for its future application, especially in the weaker countries following enlargement."
"Not only have the objectives of economic and social cohesion not been implemented and no reduction in development inequalities observed, but also, on the contrary, inequalities are increasing, even within the Member States, there is galloping unemployment and the socio-economic fabric of agricultural, mountain and remote areas is unravelling."
"A typical example is Greece, which was and still is the poorest of the 15 countries, with huge regional inequalities internally and with the sad privilege of 9 of its regions belonging to the poorest areas of the ?U. In addition, Greece refunded from the famous 'gold mine of packages' 46.4% of the subsidies relating to the funds of the richer Member States via the importation of know-how, capital equipment, goods and services."
"In other words, we are robbing Peter to pay Paul!"
"Thus, not only did Greece not benefit from regional policy, but also, on the contrary, it committed its future growth and national independence in return for a few subsidies for works and studies of questionable efficacy for its real growth."
"The European Parliament's initiative in assessing the take-up of the Structural Funds deserves praise."
"This highly negative assessment identifies a number of unacceptable problems in this instrument, which is so crucial for reducing inequalities in regional development."
"For various reasons, each one more unacceptable than the next, an excessive proportion of the available funds ends up not being used - between 30 and 60%, depending on the funds!"
"Fortunately, Portugal has a fairly good take-up rate."
"This assessment identifies the reasons for this underuse, blaming both the Commission and the Member States that benefit from these funds: a lack of transition between programmes, delays in execution and the submission of projects, inadequate coordination and poor planning decisions."
"It also presents solutions which, in my view, should be implemented in the mid-term review of the Structural Funds, such as: the simplification of procedures, monitoring of fund use, clarification of the responsibilities of the participants, and sanctions in the event of failure to keep to the timetable and fraud."
"Finally, as I have previously argued in this House, this report proposes transitional measures for those regions that currently have Objective 1 status but risk losing it because of the statistical effect resulting from the entry of poorer countries."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is sensitive to this injustice."
"."
"(PT) I voted in favour of this report."
"Once again we find that there is a large discrepancy between budgetary forecasts and actual implementation, as far as the Structural Funds are concerned."
"Utilisation of payment appropriations was 69%."
"I agree with the Commission's suggestion that greater responsibility should be given to the Member States' administrations and that procedures should be simplified, based on the adoption by the Member States of best practice, together with suitable training for administrative staff entrusted with these tasks."
"All this had already been mentioned in previous reports."
"I still consider that much greater visibility needs to be given both to the programmes and to the potential for regional development and job creation."
"I also think the European Commission should be prepared to join occupational, regional and local associations, especially in the private sector, in promoting awareness-raising activities (conferences, seminars, etc.), to serve as a practical incentive and to contribute to improving the economic actors' understanding of the potential benefits, framework and responsibilities associated with their projects."
"If the Commission approached the economic actors more closely and thus made a more effective contribution to the much-desired 'harmonious development of the whole Community', it would not only result in an increase in actual project implementation but also serve to prevent the misuse of funds, which can have dramatic consequences, as in the case of the relocation of companies that benefit from structural funds."
"."
"(PT) The imbalances among the various regions of Europe are the greatest threat to the project for the political and economic integration of the Union."
"The promotion of economic and social cohesion is a priority political objective of the Union (consolidated by the Maastricht Treaty on European Union into one of the three pillars of European integration)."
"The Cohesion Fund has played a decisive role in lessening these asymmetries by supporting those Member States with greater structural difficulties."
"It will become even more important in the context of enlargement (from 2004, all the candidate countries should become eligible)."
"I believe that the approach taken by the rapporteur in her report should have been more positive and less bureaucratic."
"I share her concerns regarding the 4.1% deficit seen in Portugal in 2001 (which thus does not conform to the macroeconomic criteria), which the present Portuguese Government inherited from the previous socialist government."
"It would have been fairer to Portugal if the rapporteur had recognised the effort and the measures that the Portuguese Government has already taken, which have been praised by both the Commission and the Council."
"All these instruments are essential to comply with the principle of economic and social cohesion."
"The Cohesion Fund, like the other Structural Funds and the remaining Community policies, should continue along these lines."
"Without cohesion, the European ideal will be lost and will fail."
"."
"(PT) Through its Cohesion Fund, the priority objective for the promotion of economic and social cohesion, the European Union has contributed to the fight against regional imbalances in the Member States."
"Because the Portuguese GNP is less than 90% of the Community average, since accession the country's infrastructure has benefited from an unprecedented leap forward, particularly in the environmental (management of water resources) and transport (railways) areas."
"With enlargement on the doorstep, it is becoming increasingly important to use the available funds effectively and rationally, to submit high quality projects and to meet realistic timetables."
"As argued in this report, I support stricter control of fund applications on the ground, a more detailed assessment of the impact of the funds, sanctions for irregularities and the recovery of sums unduly paid out."
"These are measures that will help to enhance transparency."
"It should be remembered that macroeconomic criteria, especially the increase in the public-sector deficit, affect the allocation of Community funds."
"Portugal's 4.1% deficit in 2001 raised the question of the possible suspension of funding."
"This report refers to Portugal as the only Member State in this situation!"
"In this connection, I should like to state here my clear support for the rigorous budgetary measures currently being developed in my country, despite the harsh criticism that they have attracted."
"."
"(PT) I find myself forced to abstain."
"I believe the motion for a resolution, although dealing with an annual report for 2001, falls far short of properly representing the de facto reality of the implementation of the Cohesion Fund."
"It represents inaccurate realities which, even in view of the time to which they refer, are irredeemably divorced from the framework of conclusions and ways forward that should take precedence in a report of this nature."
"Abstention also expresses my inability to agree with a reading which, in presenting concrete data supplied by the Commission, draws conclusions that have long been clearly invalid."
"Specifically, I could not help being particularly stung by the statements in clauses 8 and 9, which are potentially onerous for Portugal."
"It is unfortunately a fact that poor governance by the socialists in Portugal led to financial disaster, as shown by the public-sector deficit of 4.1% in 2001, which was punished by the Portuguese people in the early elections held in March 2002."
"On the one hand, however, this fact did not have the automatic effects that might be inferred from clause 8; and, on the other, clause 9 regrettably ignores the fact that the new Portuguese Government has - forcefully - already taken all the measures required to correct the situation. By making great sacrifices, it achieved absolute success straight away in 2002."
". I would like to highlight some important points regarding my report on the European Commission's Annual Report on the Cohesion Fund for 2001."
"In its Agenda 2000 Communication, the Commission retained the priority policy goal of promoting economic and social cohesion."
"The main aim of the Cohesion Fund was to help countries with the greatest structural disadvantages; the beneficiaries of the Fund having a per capita GNP lower than 90% of the Community average and committing to adopt a convergence programme."
"The Annual Report is an essential tool in assessing the activities of the Cohesion Fund."
"The financial execution of the fund in 2001 was generally acceptable."
"However, the issue of outstanding commitments to be paid (R.A.L.) remains a serious weakness and there is still an urgent need for rigorous checks to ensure that the rules of transparency are observed in relation to public contracts."
"The control of the Fund's activities on the ground still needs to be intensified."
"I welcome the Commission's efforts to tackle the problem, in particular through the establishment of a task force in DG Regio in April 2002 and I reiterate our call to the Commission, when it submits future reports, to give more detailed information about the projects financed."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1).)"
"."
"(PT) Although the Common Position takes up a number of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading, particularly those relating to the accident in Toulouse and the time limits for application of the directive, the fact is that it is essential to reiterate certain amendments that were not taken into consideration by the Council."
"I therefore argue that, in view of the recent mining accidents, it is fundamental that these amendments should be included in the scope of the Seveso II Directive."
"Moreover, it is important that the sites with the highest accident risk should be mapped and represented graphically."
"."
"(PT) We regret that the Council has still not pronounced on how it is going to finance the reform of the common fisheries policy and has not reached an agreement on the provision of additional appropriations for the supplementary measure on scrapping fishing vessels, when the Commission proposed an extra EUR 32 million in 2003, financed through the flexibility instrument."
"Although we reject the scrapping incentive measures (not least because the criteria are unfair), we also reject the idea already aired by the Commission that the reform should be financed through reprogramming of the FIFG or even of the other Structural Funds."
"We regret that the report does not give the Council a lead in this matter, especially in view of the opinions of the European Parliament and the Committee on Fisheries during the 2003 budget procedure debate."
"We also regret that our proposed Amendment No 5 was not approved, since 'new priorities require new financial means'."
"It is unacceptable that the fisheries sector should continue to be sacrificed, even in the preliminary draft budget for 2004, given the crisis it is undergoing and the need to support fishermen and regions dependent on the sector."
"We therefore voted against the motion."
"."
"(PT) In its Draft Amending Budget, the Commission proposed additional appropriations for the scrapping of fishing vessels through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument, to the sum of EUR 32 million."
"In its version of the Draft, the Council rejected this request since it could not reach internal agreement on the manner of financing this measure."
"I should like here to state my total support for the rapporteur in urging the Council to submit a sustainable proposal for financing the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The present request for additional appropriations simply refers to the use of surplus funds from 2002."
"There is nothing new here, just a way of giving financial resources to certain measures that have already been adopted, including:"
"the reconversion programme for the Spanish and Portuguese fleets, which suffered as a consequence of the non-renewal of the Morocco fisheries agreement; and"
"the emergency measures taken after the Prestige disaster off the Galician coast."
"It should be remembered that these measures were included in the flexibility instrument for 2003-2006, the share for 2003 being EUR 32 million."
"The Council seems to have 'forgotten' the consequences of the moratoria on cod fishing, the failure to renew the Morocco agreement and its refusal of funds for vessel modernisation."
"The Moderates are choosing today to abstain from voting in the final vote on the financing of European political parties."
"Political parties should be built upon their membership and manage without public funding."
"Public funds should not, on principle, be used to finance political parties."
"We are voting, for the aforementioned reasons, in favour of Amendment No 41, calling for the rejection of the Commission's proposal in its entirety."
"- (FR) We voted against the Leinen report on the statute and financing of European political parties because we believe it is indecent to take money from taxpayers in order to preserve these artificial bodies, the main object of which is to make people believe that there is a real European political scene, participating in European democracy."
"In reality, this is to a large extent an illusion."
"If the would-be European political parties really possessed the solid base that they claim to have, then let them be funded by that base, in other words by the national citizens and political parties."
"Moreover, the proposed 'statute' system may lead to political control of the parties, legal references for which are extremely vague, and which would be unworthy of a free society."
"This is so true that even the instigators and beneficiaries of the proposed scheme are reticent about having their names attached to it."
"The Commission would like Parliament to operate the scheme, because it is obviously political in nature. Parliament, which does not want to see its image tarnished, would like it to be run by the Commission."
"How would it be if, in order to simplify things, we just abandoned this ill-conceived proposal?"
"Financing European political parties is yet another step in the direction of the European federal superstate."
"From above, there is the desire to standardise the existing parties, knock the edges off them and extricate them from their national traditions."
"Moreover, political parties in various Member States are already being funded by the government; in Belgium, for example, they are financed by the provinces, the regions and the federal government."
"It is really worrying when funding becomes tied in with conditions."
"Concepts such as 'respecting the democratic principles' are not defined anywhere precisely."
"This opens the floodgates to arbitrariness."
"Except for the Communist parties, only the odd party represented in the European Parliament is opposed to democracy, but press articles have meanwhile shown that national right-wing parties are expressly being watched."
"In certain circles, it has become commonplace to declare opposition to 'politically correct' dogmas - concerning the immigration problem, for example - to be incompatible with democratic principles."
"Aberrations of this kind must be reserved for strictly polemical use and may not be translated into European legislation."
"The representatives of the 'Vlaams Blok' and the 'Front National' will therefore be voting against the report and will examine all legal remedies against this violation of the principle of equality."
"- (FR) I abstained from the vote on this report for two reasons."
"The main reason is that the regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties authorises gifts from legal persons to European political parties."
"I cannot accept such a proposal because it would make it impossible for the parties to be independent of business circles."
"The influence of the business lobbies on parties and political orientations is already considerable, and direct financing, even with a ceiling attached to it, would increase even further their influence on political parties."
"Besides, there is no guarantee that the financing of the national political parties by the European political parties will be kept separate, because of the authorisation of cross-border measures."
"Finally, it is no longer a question of European political parties, but rather of political parties at European level."
"I decided to abstain, rather than vote against this report, because I believe that the adoption of such a statute is a strong and positive signal of a move towards a closer Union and towards a destiny that is truly shared."
"The European political parties, funded by public subsidies and by contributions from activists, are one of the means offered to our citizens of bringing about this increasingly close Union of our peoples."
". We cannot support this attempt to build a political and parliamentary sphere in the European Union from above."
"The EU elite believes European political parties will solve legitimacy problems and support integration, but the opposite is likely to happen."
"There will be conflicts between the rights of national political parties and European political parties since they have to be active within the same 'political space' (There is no European political space which exists in no-man's-land above the national territories)."
"The citizens in the Member States, who are supposed to contribute tax money to the proposed European parties, will view these as artificial bodies intended to reduce the influence of the national parties and to impose political integration from the top down."
"Democracy must be built from the bottom up, not the other way around."
"We strongly recommend that the proposal be withdrawn."
". (EL) The report being debated has no administrative character, it has a purely political character."
"The proposed introduction of European political parties is not the result of voluntary choice and agreement on action based on common ideological approaches; on the contrary, it is intended to bring about acceptance of the reactionary and anti-grass roots structure of the ?U."
"For the ?U, respect for the 'rule of law' is respect for the dictatorship of the monopolies, with the Schengen Agreement, fewer and fewer rights and personal freedoms, EMU, part-time and temporary work and anti-grass roots austerity programmes, in order to safeguard big business's profits."
"The ?U's ambition, using blackmail and funding as a lever, is to incorporate its terms for building parties into its reactionary policies and so impose them."
"It opts for constant and institutionalised intervention in the Member States, in order to restrict the voice and action of the political forces which have an anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist character and are fighting the ?U. The strategic objective is to depreciate the class struggle at international and national level in the consciousness of the peoples."
"A party has validity at European and international level when it is strong in its own country."
"Opportunist political configurations are being strengthened which put a brake on the radicalisation of consciousnesses, on the search for struggling poles of expression and action, trapping the peoples in reactions that are painless to the system."
"For these reasons, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report and called for it to be withdrawn."
"- (FR) Apart from outstanding issues such as the role of the Commission in allocating and controlling credits, there are certain points that give rise to serious problems."
"One is the obligation imposed on the European parties to respect the principles of democracy and of the rule of law, as well as the fundamental rights and principles contained in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the Treaties ."
"I am very worried about the irregularities that such a provision could lead to, given that it contains the seeds of the principle of the prohibition of political parties, because that is what the exclusion of part of the public financing boils down to."
"This measure, which is fatal to freedom, is all the more shocking in that it leaves room for arbitrariness."
"How can we possibly believe that the verification, by Parliament, of the statute, programme and activities of a political party will be carried out objectively?"
"Moreover, we must emphasise the fact that a Europe of parties, which is what the proposal seeks to achieve, will in no way be the same thing as a European democracy."
"Nothing could be worse than to watch the development, within the European Union, of a system dominated by parties greedy for power, a system which, in France, was responsible for the collapse of the Third and Fourth Republics."
"."
"(PT) I regret the manner in which this report was put before the house."
"When the agenda includes the strengthening of 'democracy and transparency' in the functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament should set an example."
"This has certainly not happened, with the last-minute tabling of a vast number of apparent 'compromise amendments', considerably changing positions the rapporteur had always upheld and resulting from direct negotiations with the Council, about which more detailed information should be provided."
"As I said in the debate, the best thing would be to apply Rule 130a of the Rules of Procedure, send the procedure back to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and reschedule the subject for the July part-session."
"In addition, although I recognise that the final positions reflect highly positive advances compared with both the Commission's initial proposal and the rapporteur's obstinacy - a development that I welcome - I still have differences on essential points: the failure to provide for an expanded system embracing all legitimately constituted political parties, since the Treaty does not authorise discrimination between political parties 'at European level', recognising also that they are all 'important'; the requirement for a level of self-financing that I consider too high and which I fear will be a source of problems at a supranational level; the non-jurisdictional system for rejecting funding, as I do not think the obvious existence of the right to appeal is sufficient."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"I have voted against the report, which was nonetheless adopted by 345 votes, with 102 votes against and 34 abstentions."
"The reason for this is, firstly, that it would be preferable if the Commission were to set the amount of party financing, not Parliament, which would in that way grant party financing to its own 'political European families'."
"There would be a significant temptation to do this."
"Secondly, the requirements for forming a European political party have been set too high, with representation demanded in every fourth Member State."
"Thirdly, there is a built-in risk of arbitrariness inasmuch as separate assessment criteria are applied to what are termed European parties before they are given financial support."
"Who is to decide how these criteria are to be applied?"
"In practice, it is the dangerous system whereby political parties are to decide which political groups are to have the status of parties and so receive financial aid, a system unknown to the Swedish Parliament."
"As Flemish Socialists, we have voted against the Council's compromise concerning the statute for European political parties as this was presented before the EP, because it does not sufficiently guarantee the independence of European political parties."
"The compromise contains a financial arrangement which means that fully-fledged European parties can be co-financed by donations from 2004 onwards."
"The compromise that was reached, as a result of which a donor - being a natural or legal entity - can donate up to EUR 12 000 per annum to a European party, with a traceability ceiling of EUR 500, is unacceptable to us."
"We continue to work for a ban on company donations and a ceiling on private donations of EUR 2 000 per annum, whereby donors are required to make themselves known if they contribute EUR 125 or more."
"Overall, we are abstaining from voting in favour of the motion for a resolution in Mrs Terrón i Cusí's report on an open method of coordination for the Community immigration policy."
"We are in favour of the motion, but are abstaining from voting since we believe that it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide."
"- (FR) We voted against the Terrón i Cusí report on the Community immigration policy because it constitutes, in both form and content, an example of one of the most disastrous products of the European Parliament."
"As regards form, it was added to the agenda at the last moment and it was the subject of a vote of approval without any debate, like most of the reports this session."
"As for content, this text, submitted by a rapporteur from the Left, is supposed to deal with immigration policy as a whole, yet it says almost nothing about illegal immigration."
"On the contrary, it considers that the crucial factor for evaluating the success of a European immigration policy is the full integration of the migrants into the host countries."
"With this in mind, it proposes, amongst other things, the creation of a 'civic citizenship' enabling legal immigrants to be given various rights, including the right to vote in local and European elections (paragraph 29)."
"Not surprisingly, the report states (in paragraph 53) that the European Refugee Fund cannot finance forced repatriation, yet it welcomes the Commission's proposal concerning the financing of pilot projects relating to integration (paragraph 39)."
"I am voting against the report, since a political document that is silent about the conditions in European jails designed for deportees, about deaths at the borders, basically caused by European border controls, and about the structural racism of European immigration policy does not deserve to be endorsed."
"What is more, European migration policy pursues two objectives: it increases the isolation of Fortress Europe by shifting border controls further upstream, namely to countries of transit and origin; and it optimises the economic exploitation of what are, from a capitalist point of view, 'usable' labour forces."
"The report before us attacks, however, neither the reduction in the level of protection for refugees to the lowest common denominator nor the hypocrisy and double standards in the so-called 'fight against illegal immigration', aimed at militarising the borders at the same time as purloining cheap labour forces."
"It even still welcomes the introduction of common border controls."
"The deportation agreements that are being urged upon third countries by the EU are not up for debate."
"The report before us does not even begin to criticise this repressive and xenophobic behaviour."
"Instead, a large majority in Parliament applauds a toothless report representing the wretched political mainstream."
"I do not add my voice to this majority."
"."
"(PT) We support the United Nations' initiatives aiming to combat the illegal trade in weapons, including light weapons, which feed the traffic in arms and the profits of the major armaments industries."
"Significantly, however, I must highlight the fact - and the contradiction - that this debate took place in conjunction with the debate on a 'Security Strategy for the European Union', attended by Javier Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP, who had prepared a report for the Thessaloniki Council."
"Why?"
"Because in his speech Mr Solana upheld a concept of security based on militarism and interventionism, arguing for the development of a strategy assuring an early, rapid and 'robust' intervention, when necessary, and the existence of more military resources in combination with diplomatic and civil instruments."
"This proposed 'Security Strategy for the European Union' seems to adapt the objectives of the CFSP and CESDP to the conclusions of the Washington and Prague NATO Summits in that it places the emphasis on the possibility of using military aggression."
"In other words, it is a consolidation of policies and instruments that are the negation of disarmament and détente in international relations and seek to guarantee worldwide military domination, through a hoped-for 'partnership' of the European Union with the United States."
"."
"(PT) The essential problem of developing countries with regard to energy - in contrast to the situation in more developed countries - is not the replacement of current production sources with other, less polluting ones."
"The essential problem is one of access to any sources of energy at all."
"Note that two thousand million citizens do not have access to electricity."
"So in order to achieve the dual objective of democratising access to electricity without worsening the greenhouse effect, it is fundamental that we should support the transfer of technology and the financing of environmentally beneficial projects."
"It is unacceptable that the European Union should send its most obsolete technology to developing countries."
"I welcome the efforts made by the European Union at Johannesburg for there to be binding targets for renewable energies, and the initiatives launched at that summit to get businesses involved."
"I believe the rapporteur has made an excellent contribution to this cooperative effort to share the best technologies."
"- (FR) The Wijkman report has the great merit of demonstrating the key role played by energy in development, and of giving us some sobering figures that reveal the size of the problem."
"From the two billion human beings who do not currently have access to an energy service capable of responding to their basic needs, to the forecasts of the growth in world energy demand by the year 2020 (an increase of 65% compared with 1995), the accent is judiciously placed on the vicious circles of under-development on which it is now absolutely essential to take action in the interests of the planet as a whole."
"Although, like the rapporteur, we can welcome the Commission's initiatives, we would hasten to add that, when mentioning their lack of ambition, emphasis could - and indeed should - have been placed on the lack of any research effort as regards nuclear energy, because serious forecast studies clearly show - and the rapporteur, in spite of himself, also contributes to this conclusion - that we will not be capable of meeting the future energy needs of the planet if we turn our backs on the only technology that is capable of effectively taking over from fossil energy sources, which are often, as the report emphasises, the source of covetousness and of extremely serious conflicts."
"My group will vote in favour of this report, hoping that it will contribute towards this salutary realisation."
"."
"(PT) I congratulate Mr Wijkman on his excellent report, both for his insightful reading of the key role played by energy in development policies and for the ways forward that he points out, which are always marked by a pivotal concern to improve living conditions for the poorest people."
"This concern and the adoption of practical, realistic and effective measures are a challenge for the creativity of the peoples in the European Union and an imperative for humanity."
"We have to break the energy-poverty nexus - the basis for the two Commission proposals - in that 'where energy is lacking, poverty develops and a vicious circle comes into being.'"
"I share the rapporteur's concerns about the lack of a clear financial commitment by the Commission to back up the diagnosis made."
"I believe, however, that we are moving in the right direction. Even from a merely economic viewpoint, all the support that can be realised in the field of energy is clearly an investment for the future."
"For everybody."
"It is one of the areas in which development policy can have a more lasting and visible effect."
"We Moderates believe that the marine environment is important and should be protected."
"The prerequisites for a clean Baltic Sea environment in the future have improved considerably through the fall of Communism and are in the process of being improved further through the enlargement of the European Union."
"Through EU cooperation, the common work in favour of a cleaner Baltic Sea will be intensified."
"We have voted in favour of this own-initiative report in spite of its not taking account of what has already been done and in spite of the fact that the rapporteur wishes to direct developments using unduly far-reaching central control and supranationalism."
"We Moderates believe that the problems of the Baltic Sea neither can nor should be solved in the same way as, for example, the Mediterranean's."
"Affected countries and regions in their respective geographical areas must be able to find solutions adapted to local conditions."
"."
"(PT) As stated in the plan of implementation from the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, 'oceans, seas, islands and coastal areas form an integrated and essential component of the Earth's ecosystem and are critical for global food security.'"
"Protection of the marine environment, particularly the conservation of its biodiversity, must be considered a priority, and further action in the field of marine protection, a true coastal policy and promotion of sustainable use of the seas are all needed."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur that a strategy in this field must integrate the following: the precautionary principle; the development of protection and conservation measures; an integrated approach to all human activities impacting on the marine environment; an integrated approach in the management of fishing effort; and a regional approach, taking into account regional diversities and respect for their 'ecological characteristics and socio-economic aspects', without forgetting that there are other causes of marine pollution."
"Hence we consider that the recent Commission proposal for the management of fishing effort in the Atlantic calls into question the objectives of conservation and the ability of Portugal, in particular, to carry out conservation measures in its exclusive economic zone."
"- (FR) I voted in favour of this report."
"To adopt a strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment is to devise a real European policy in favour of marine safety."
"The rules and directives are in place."
"It is up to Member States to apply them and up to the European Commission to monitor their implementation."
"We must be firm on this point, because it is only too easy, when disaster strikes, to make Europe the ideal scapegoat."
"New marine safety requirements are also proposed in order to protect our coasts, such as the use of double-hulled vessels and possible penal sanctions for anyone committing infringements, and I am asking that these measures be accompanied by the creation of European coastguard services."
"This policy seeks to protect and preserve instead of attempting to repair the damage that has already been caused."
"In effect, environmental disasters cannot be remedied by subsidies."
"The regions affected are suffering, and will continue to suffer, for a long time, in terms of their biodiversity and their ecological balances, so essential to the preservation of fish stocks and the conservation of species."
"."
"(PT) I congratulate the Commission on the Communication it has presented."
"I consider, however, that the Communication should have based its analysis on the conservation of fish stocks and not on vague sustainability."
"It also did not go far enough in analysing the impact of fishing on the protection of the marine environment or in defining the quantified targets and timetables to be achieved."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will, as soon as possible, table a draft strategy for the protection of the marine environment, setting out a global response to the challenge of promoting the sustainability of the marine environment, both by coordinating and consolidating the various legal texts that already exist and also by encouraging the creation of European and worldwide monitoring and assessment bodies."
"This strategy must contain an action plan for the protection of the marine environment that includes targets, resources and timetables."
"Lastly, I appeal to the leading role of the European Union in the international negotiations on marine conservation: it is fundamental that by-catch techniques (laying very long nets which end up killing non-target species such as cetaceans, seals, birds and turtles) should be severely restricted on a worldwide scale."
"."
"(PT) The unanimity achieved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy confirms the almost incontrovertible nature of this own-initiative report."
"I shared its positions and voted in favour."
"I believe it is appropriate to set up a harmonised European Marine Strategy, the need for which has been demonstrated."
"Moreover, the idea that the lack of complete information is not an excuse for avoiding the adoption of precautionary measures (especially where the decline in biodiversity is beyond doubt) is, if not applied blindly, a worthy principle for taking action."
"Equally useful is the rapporteur's request for the European Union to decide to join the Arctic Council (whose current members are the United States, Canada, Iceland, Norway and Russia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland)."
"If the EU were a member, this would surely improve Euro-Atlantic understanding of environmental problems and give the EU a significant forum, particularly for the protection the Nordic marine environment."
"As for the Commission's conviction that the maximum sustainable yield should be defined in terms of the sustainability of stocks and not of economic sustainability, I think a more balanced approach is needed: a strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment, and at the same time a definition of mechanisms to enhance economic sustainability."
"The best thing about such a compromise is surely finding that the policy thus defined is a constant success."
"."
"(PT) As I wrote in my explanation of vote on the Markov report, here too one of the main problems of the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) - the development programme aimed at eight of the countries in the process of accession, for the year 2001 - is the persistence of difficulties associated with fund utilisation procedures."
"The ISPA programmes form a sort of Cohesion Fund for the countries that are soon to join the European Union, and aim at improving basic infrastructure in the environmental and transport fields."
"Within this framework, as the rapporteur points out, it is important to invest in good administrative training for the staff in these countries who will be managing the Structural Fund aids from next year. This will avoid bureaucratic hold-ups, which result in constant bottlenecks and delays."
"In agreeing with the rapporteur's position, the message that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism would like to pass on to the Commission is also that a major simplification of procedures is needed, without prejudice to compliance with essential measures on accounting controls."
"Otherwise, there will be a risk of serious paralysis in the next few years, offset by last-minute liberality that is not consistent with ideas of rational and structural development."
"."
"(PT) The viability of the fisheries sector depends on the sustainability of fish stocks, which must be treated as a public commodity."
"We therefore agree with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, according to which measures should be introduced so that pollution, waste, discards and catch by lost gear or of non-target species are minimised."
"What is needed is the development and use of more selective and environmentally safe fishing gear and techniques, and effective protection for juvenile fish."
"The FAO has estimated the volume of fish discards within commercial fisheries at between 17.9 and 39.5 million tonnes per year, or between two and five times the EU's fisheries production, which is quite unacceptable."
"We agree in general with the objectives of this report."
"We think, however, that the solution will only be found when there is effective decentralisation of the common fisheries policy, enabling fishermen, scientists and public authorities to play an active role. Initially, as the rapporteur states, this may be achieved through the involvement of the Regional Advisory Councils, as provided for by Regulation 2371/2002, in formulating a strategy on the elimination of discards."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
". (FR) I abstained from voting on the resolution on the trans-Atlantic partnership, even though it is, as a whole, an excellent one, containing as it does features that European Socialists, and Europeans generally, see as essential, namely the reaffirmation of the desire for multilateralism in trans-Atlantic policy, the importance accorded to international law, and the preservation of European social legislation with the adoption of Mr Obiols' Amendment No 16."
"We adopted Amendment No 26, however, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which stresses that European security strategy should take into account the US national security strategy and that the EU should be especially prudent in the positions it takes relating to situations that the United States appears to interpret in a different way."
"The partnership is in serious danger of being nothing more than a monologue."
"The Europeans will never get the Americans to declare themselves ready to sign international conventions against torture and antipersonnel mines or upholding the Kyoto convention, the International Criminal Court or the application of the Geneva Convention to Guantanamo."
"On the other hand, it might be thought that, should the European Union not undertake to take US strategy into account, it would be not only the NATO headquarters in Brussels that would be under threat but that of the European institutions too!"
". The British Conservatives, however, are forced reluctantly to vote against the resolution because of a number of references which we do not believe are helpful either to understanding or to good relations."
"There is, for example, a reference to unilateral approaches to problems that is offensive and which ignores the pre-eminent role which the United States as the world's largest and most powerful country must inevitably play if the values to which we subscribe are to be upheld."
"The insistence that the United States share Europe's view on the ICC is also made plain - despite the problems that an unamended statute would cause for the United States at present."
"Equally there is no need for Europe continually to seek disagreement with the United States over the death penalty which remains legal in international law."
"We need to respect their difference of opinion, not attempt to raise it as a symbol of European moral superiority over the United States."
"There has been too much anti-Americanism in Europe recently and Europe needs to remember what it owes to America."
"That is not fully reflected in the resolution as it stands."
"Lastly we cannot support QMV in the CFSP."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 19 June 2003."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Piet Dankert, from Stiens in Friesland, whose enthusiasm for social democracy had been kindled by his Frisian grandfather, started his career as a teacher, and made an important contribution in Europe in many roles, of which I should like to list a few examples."
"Openness."
"The election of Piet Dankert to President of the European Parliament was the first time that a decision of such significance had not been reached internally among groups."
"The election was held in an open and almost professional manner, and included a press campaign."
"This action was about twenty years ahead of its time."
"Piet Dankert, monsieur le Président."
"Perseverance."
"As a good European, Piet believed in the right and proper use of European money."
"He took an interest in any report of possible misuse."
"However, he was also keen to find out whether the accounts were true."
"Sometimes, the facts were somewhat distorted to ensure that other bodies with more powers would actually take action."
"Democracy."
"In 1979, Piet Dankert managed to give the European Parliament more bite by deploying budget legislation as a political instrument in an inventive manner."
"He threatened that Parliament would vote against the Budget, and this is exactly what happened."
"Ever since, the Commission and Council have been forced to take the European Parliament seriously."
"Vision."
"Piet Dankert wanted a more social and democratic Europe with a clearly defined role in a world with which it shows solidarity."
"Piet Dankert featured in this connection as a level-headed and realistic champion of the European ideal."
"In the capacity of secretary of state for Europe, he tabled proposals for a more democratic Europe during the Dutch Presidency in Maastricht in 1992."
"Governments were not quite ready for this."
"Piet Dankert observed with satisfaction that the results of the Convention were not dissimilar from his own proposals all those years ago."
"Enjoyment."
"In 1979, Piet Dankert made a very conscious and clear decision in favour of the European Parliament over the Dutch Second Chamber."
"According to him, operating at international level was more fun and more exciting."
"He also knew how to enjoy the pleasant sides of his job."
"From time to time, Piet was able to appreciate a meal consisting of a little more than a cheese roll and a mug of buttermilk."
"Relations."
"He was averse to hoo-ha, could be very obstinate, yet was at times almost shy."
"He was a kind and honest man, and was able to identify with the political way of thinking of people from other countries."
"Over the past few days, and during the commemorative service yesterday in the Great Church at Edam, many confirmed this image of him as Monsieur l'Europe."
"We hope that all these impressions, qualities and images of Piet Dankert will be of comfort to his wife, Paulette, and his children."
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 26 June has been distributed."
"The following changes have been proposed"
"Mr President, as you will be aware, the relevant Rule states that there will be a debate and vote."
"I presume there will be a debate as well, as the Rule specifies."
"Mr President, I would like to raise the matter of the European Youth Parliament and the funding of EUR 180 000, which this Parliament approved for the year 2003."
"The difficulty is that the Youth Parliament is now at risk of having to cancel its event planned for 11-20 July because the Commission is refusing to confirm that this money is available to it in order to run this event."
"I am appealing to you, Mr President, to contact the Commission as a matter of urgency to seek to ensure that this money is made available, or at the very least that a letter is sent to confirm that it is available, so that these young people - who, after all, are the future politicians who will maintain this institution and other European Union institutions - are allowed to continue with their work."
"They need this confirmation urgently because they need to access temporary financing in order to overcome the difficulty created by the Commission."
"We will contact the Commission on that matter this afternoon."
"Mr President, less than a month on from the visit of the President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, Mr Bouteflika, to this House, which should have strengthened the ties between the European Union and Algeria, a serious incident has taken place."
"The Algerian ambassador to the United Nations has requested that the representative of the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, leave Algeria."
"For its part, the World Bank has decided to suspend programmes in the country until the presidential elections in 2004."
"I would ask, Mr President, for a response from Parliament, that a letter of response be sent to the President of the Republic and the Algerian Government and that a letter of support be sent to the United Nations Secretary General and to the person concerned."
"I would also call upon the Commission to arrange a debate with the United Nations on the situation of this country, with regard to judicial reforms and, in particular, the earthquake."
"I hope, Mr President, that you will act on my request."
"Mr Schmidt, I do not want to open a debate on this issue at the moment."
"Ordinarily, this should be signalled to the services in advance."
"Then, as I have done with the other issues of which we have been informed in advance, I would put it to the House for adoption or rejection."
"At this stage I regret to say that you have missed the boat with regard to setting the agenda."
"We did not deal with it last week at the Conference of Presidents and it was not signalled to us under the relevant procedure in time to deal with it today."
"We have already been through the adoption of the agenda and the issue was not raised at that time."
"It seems to me that I have covered the requirements under the Rules of Procedure."
"Under the Rule you quote it clearly says that we adopt such changes at the start of a part-session."
"Regrettably, you raised the point when we had finished that part of the procedure."
"Mr President, you are absolutely right but I was not fast enough."
"I was told that the boat was there last week, and the question was raised."
"We can debate it in September but it is unfortunate because the matter ought to have gone before the Council this week."
"I will be quicker next time!"
"Mr President, I wish to raise an issue which has been brought to my attention because of my work with refugees."
"It concerns an individual of Iranian origin living in the UK who, on a visit to Syria, was abducted by the Syrian authorities and handed over to the Iranians."
"His name is Jamil Bassam and he has been living in the UK for 25 years."
"He visited Syria with all the appropriate documents and, along with a colleague, Ibrahim Khodabandeh, was abducted by the Syrian authorities and handed over to Iranian officials."
"Given the disquiet voiced in this House on many occasions about the situation in Iran, and the way in which political opponents are treated there, this is obviously a matter of some concern."
"I am asking you, therefore, to raise this issue with the Iranian authorities and do what you can to secure his safe release and that of his colleague."
"Mr President, my point of order is not as serious as some of the previous ones."
"It has been brought to my attention that a Union Jack is flying out of a window between the sixth and seventh floors of the Louise Weiss building."
"This might be a rash of patriotic enthusiasm or the flag might be just hanging out to dry."
"We cannot tell from looking at it from the outside who is responsible for this; I have my suspicions though."
"Could we ask whoever has hung out this Union Jack to perhaps remove it, unless we are all to hang our flags outside the windows."
"As you know, Mr President, this is against the rules."
"All I can say to you, Mrs Banotti, in your role as chairman of the College of Quaestors, is PACE!"
"Mr President, another ten emigrants drowned yesterday while trying to reach Italy."
"They wanted to work in Europe."
"In the last few weeks, hundreds of emigrants have suffered the same tragic fate off the coasts of southern Italy, Andalucia and the Canary Islands."
"I mention this state of affairs once again in an attempt to induce Parliament and the Union to take the necessary political steps to avoid these intolerable tragedies and prevent them from happening ever again."
"In any event, let us remember these innocent people."
"Mr President, please allow me to thank you on behalf of all Andalusian fishermen, and on my own behalf, for the efforts you are making to persuade the Portuguese authorities to free Agustín García, the fisherman who, as you know, has spent more than two months in prison."
"Mr President, the Guadiana fishing agreement between Spain and Portugal expires today, and it would be really positive if the negotiations on the renewal of this agreement were to begin with a gesture of friendship and goodwill on the part of Portugal, freeing the imprisoned fisherman, as well as a commitment on the part of all fishermen to respect all the agreements signed."
"I would like to thank you once again and I would ask you not to forget this issue and to communicate this proposal to the relevant authorities."
"Mr President, I, like a previous speaker, wish to refer to the case of Mr Abrahim Khodabandeh and Mr Jamil Bassam, both of whom are residents of Barnet, in my constituency."
"Mr Khodabandeh - who has been resident in the UK for many years and was granted refugee status - was travelling recently in Syria to assist humanitarian efforts to deal with the consequences of the war in Iraq."
"He was forcibly removed from Syria and taken to Iran where he and his colleague, Mr Bassam, remain in custody."
"Mr Khodabandeh's family and friends are deeply concerned about his fate."
"I ask the House to urge the Iranian authorities to release Mr Khodabandeh, since his deportation contravened the ordinary principles of international law."
"We are very concerned about the circumstances of the deportation."
"I urge the House to add its efforts to the campaign to free these two people."
"As you said, our colleague, Mrs Lambert also raised this point."
"Yes, I will prepare an exchange of letters with the relevant authorities and send copies to both of you in the course of the week."
"Mr President, I refer to the continuing media reports that US President Bush is accusing the EU and EU leaders of funding Hamas."
"These reports have been ongoing over the past week."
"I ask you to communicate strongly to President Bush that there is no truth in this allegation."
"In Rome this last weekend, at a meeting of the EU-US delegation, I and other Members of Parliament strongly refuted this allegation and outlined the stringent budgetary controls in place for the funding of the Palestinian Authority, to make sure that such funds are not misappropriated."
"I urge you to raise this issue with President Bush at the earliest possible opportunity."
"The next item is the report (A5-0246/2003) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for waiver of the immunity of Mr Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit ((2000/2109(IMM))."
"Mr President, I hope I will not use up all these five minutes."
"This procedure has to do with an application for the waiver of Mr Cohn-Bendit's parliamentary immunity made by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Frankfurt on the basis of charges laid by a member of the Hessen Land parliament."
"In these charges, Mr Cohn-Bendit is accused of obstructing the course of a prosecution, in that - as stated in newspaper reports - he, together with others, a number of decades ago now, helped a Mr Klein, a terrorist alleged to have taken part in the OPEC attack in Vienna, to flee to France."
"In the normal course of events, Parliament would comply with such a request when it was made."
"There were, however, a number of peculiarities, which led the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to take a somewhat different approach to this matter."
"One reason why it did so was that the original application submitted to us was - let me put it frankly - relatively flimsy; that is to say, its substance did not amount to very much."
"The result of this was that, in the summer of 2000 - only a few weeks after the application was made to us - the then chairman of our committee, Mrs Ana Palacio, wrote a letter to the German authorities asking for further detailed information."
"The German authorities supplied this further detailed information after two more years had elapsed - that is how long this process took - and this meant that our committee could then rule on the matter."
"I myself had, as rapporteur, originally proposed that, in this specific case, a conditional waiver might be considered, as is provided for in our Rules of Procedure, but - as I mentioned earlier - there is a whole array of peculiarities associated with this case, and these meant that the great majority on the committee saw it as right and proper not to waive immunity in this specific case."
"Such was the prevailing opinion."
"One of the reasons for this is that, as regards at least some of the things Mr Cohn-Bendit may have got up to at the time, he did them at the behest of the German internal secret services, or with their direct or indirect involvement; it is in any case quite remarkable that the secret services should involve themselves in such things, while, on the other hand, the law enforcement authorities of the same country seek to take action against them."
"Another point was that Mr Cohn-Bendit indicated that it was him alone against whom investigations were in progress, rather than against all the others named in this newspaper article as possible accomplices."
"The third point has to do with the proceedings against the terrorist Mr Klein, which have now run their course, and in which the judge, in stating the grounds on which his judgment was based expressed admiration for what Mr Cohn-Bendit had done and depicted it as a typical example of what constructive help could be given to enable such people to break free from terrorist circles."
"Against this background, the committee came to the conclusion that the special circumstances of this case mean that the waiver of immunity does not appear to be justified."
"I would like to make it quite clear that this does not mean that we are accusing the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office of fumus persecutionis, that is, of criminal proceedings intended to prejudice Mr Cohn-Bendit's political activities."
"That is something that I too repeatedly opposed in the debate in the committee, quite simply because, as German law on immunity stands, a German public prosecutor's office simply cannot do otherwise; it is not permitted even to open a file and commence investigations before a definite decision has been taken on the waiver of immunity."
"Taking the overall circumstances of this case into account, however, it seems appropriate to us - particularly in view of the European elections being not that far off - that immunity should not be waived in this case."
"I ask the plenary to endorse the committee's proposal."
"Mr President, there are some points I would like to underline in supporting what Mr Lehne said at the beginning of this debate."
"First, and most importantly, we are dealing with a matter of great public concern, but a matter that has been in the public domain for a long time."
"We are dealing with a course of events which Mr Cohn-Bendit has not merely not denied but has also publicly avowed."
"We are dealing with a course of events in respect of which Mr Cohn-Bendit was specifically praised by the trial court involved in the trial of Mr Klein some years ago, where the court drew attention to the courage and public spirit of the people who had assisted in getting that particular accused person to come out of hiding and give himself up to the public authorities."
"So this is not a case of somebody seeking surreptitiously to hide from accusations or from public justice, but of somebody who has openly avowed his actions."
"Mr Lehne was absolutely right to say that there can be no question of the public prosecutors in Frankfurt being themselves in any way deviously motivated."
"They have a public duty to take up a complaint that has been laid before them on ostensibly justifiable grounds."
"However, it does not follow that those who laid the accusation before the public prosecutors, thereby triggering that public duty, were themselves wholly lacking in any deviousness of motive."
"When account is taken of two aspects of the public interest here today - firstly, that there ought not to be unreasonable protection of MEPs or anybody else from public prosecution where circumstances warrant it and, secondly and importantly, that electoral debate and discussion should be able to go forward without unreasonable impediment or harassment of leading figures in it - the balance of the public interest in this case seems to be absolutely clear: the public prosecutors are doing their duty and we should do ours."
"In this case, that duty points clearly in the direction indicated by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to decline waiving the immunity."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor to speak on this report because, at last, Parliament is taking into consideration the specific nature of the request made by the national authorities when addressing the issue of immunity."
"In the case of Mr Cohn-Bendit, we have decided not to waive immunity for a very specific reason, although, ultimately, it might have been in Mr Cohn-Bendit's interests for this trial to go ahead."
"For Parliament, on the other hand, the fact that the case has been raised many years after the alleged incident and that there could objectively be a suspicion or a suggestion that, behind this belated recognition by the German authorities of the possible guilt of Mr Cohn-Bendit, there might conceivably lie 'fumus persecutionis', justifies the stance taken by our committee, which I and my fellow Radical Members support."
"I am saying this in anticipation of other cases too, Mr President, for although it is true that in some countries we have reduced the scope of immunity, confining it strictly to the political activities of each Member of Parliament, it is also true that the scope of political activities cannot be limited solely to what is said in the Chamber, at least where those political and legal systems which provide for extensive immunity for Members of Parliament are concerned."
"Until we have the single Statute for Members of the European Parliament, until Mr Rothley's line becomes law in our Union, I hope, from this point of view, that it will be precisely the examination of our texts which will prompt the Intergovernmental Conference to accept the idea that the Members' Statute should have a prominent place in the forthcoming European Constitution and specifically recommend that specific immunity and specific privileges be included in the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"There is no doubt that the evidence in a case which indicates the political nature of an act can fall down, whether in this or in future cases."
"For example, as you know, you will soon be called upon to deal with the case of Mr Dupuis, who handed out doses of hashish as a way of condemning Italian legislation on drugs, which will lead to the opening of a case."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I support the line taken by Mr MacCormick, and I believe that, in acting in this way, Parliament will be setting a precedent for subsequent cases."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"Mr President, this is one of those cases concerning the immunity of a Member of Parliament which raises in a very sharp form the issue of the immunity or non-immunity of Members when they are indulging in political activity outside Parliament."
"It is very clear law that expressions of opinions or votes cast in this House can never be the subject of legal action or prosecution anywhere."
"That is an essential part of the liberty of discussion in a democratic assembly."
"However, in the course of their duties, Members of this House often indulge in political speech and political activity elsewhere, most particularly in their own constituencies and in their home state - for example at party congresses."
"The case we have before us concerning Mr Camre arises from a speech at his party congress in Denmark in 2001, shortly after the desperate events of 11 September."
"In the course of a speech to his party congress, Mr Camre made some very strong and, in my personal judgment, highly offensive remarks about Muslims living in the West."
"All the countries of the West, he said, are infiltrated by Muslims and some of them speak nicely to us while they are waiting to become sufficiently numerous to get rid of us, as they have done in Sudan, Indonesia, Nigeria and the Balkans."
"There are other similar or even more unpleasant remarks."
"Under Danish criminal law, section 226 b of the Danish Criminal Code, it is an offence to make statements constituting derisory and humiliating treatment of a group of people."
"In this case the accusation is that the statements made were derisory and humiliating treatment of people in Denmark, namely people of Muslim belief or family background."
"Under European law, the position is that a Member of this House, acting in his home state, enjoys the same immunity from prosecution and legal intervention as would a Member of the home parliament."
"Under the Danish constitution, a Member accused of a criminal offence such as this enjoys immunity from prosecution unless the Folketing - the parliament - waives that immunity."
"We are informed that normally the Folketing would waive immunity in a case of this kind."
"However, the European Parliament has always rightly said that we must have a common set of principles concerning the waiver of immunity that apply to all MEPs in all countries."
"Therefore, the issue is not would the Danish Parliament waive immunity? but ought this Parliament to waive immunity in a case of this kind? where the words complained of are certainly to any ordinary judgment very offensive - to put it mildly - but where they are also unquestionably statements made in the course of a political activity."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market instructed me - rightly - to look into the whole range of the precedents, the decisions that this House has taken about immunity in these sorts of situations."
"It became clear to the officials who looked into it, and myself, that Parliament has a universal practice of declining to waive immunity in the context of prosecutions where what is involved is a prosecution of matters which are directly the content of a Member's political activity."
"That being so, while I have to say that I myself have extreme disgust for the remarks that were made, I consider it to be my duty as rapporteur, and in any event it is the unanimous opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee, that in this case the Parliament ought to inform the Danish authorities that it declines to waive the immunity of Mr Camre and I so recommend."
"I must say, as I reviewed the case law, it did seem to me personally - and this is a purely personal opinion - that it might be that over the years we have cast the net of parliamentary immunity rather wide."
"It would not be appropriate or just to use an individual case arbitrarily to change the practice, but it might be worth the Committee on Constitutional Affairs reviewing the question of how far we ought to expect parliamentary immunity to extend, how far we should wish it to."
"I believe it would be appropriate for the Constitutional Affairs Committee to consider this if in due course it were invited to do so."
"But that is a separate issue."
"There is no doubt that the required course of justice in upholding the long-standing principles and case law of this Parliament is to decline to waive immunity in this case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I share Mr MacCormick's view."
"Mr Camre's utterances, which are at issue here, are surely utterly unacceptable and intolerable, nor could they ever enjoy anyone's political support."
"That, however, is not what this was about."
"This was simply about the question as to whether this is one of those instances - to be found in previous exemplary cases - in which we have, in the past, come to the decision that a Member's freedom of speech is inseparable from his duties as an MEP, that is to say, from his mandate."
"Mr Camre came out with these utterances at his party conference in Denmark, and this is a quite classic case in which we must assume that he was acting in connection with his mandate as an MEP."
"I might add that Mr MacCormick's report, as well as the opinion that our secretariat has been so kind as to draw up, clearly show that this is the decision we came to in the past."
"I believe that this House is also under a self-imposed obligation to continue to come to similar decisions, most especially when it is obvious that political activities are concerned."
"Apart from that, the different ways in which each Member State deals with these things will, in the long term, only be resolved if - as Mr Rothley has mentioned in his report - a single European immunity law is soon on the way."
"It is the Council that holds the key to this."
"Let the Council simply adopt our statute."
"The Council would also be making a great contribution to progress if it were to give some thought, perhaps in the course of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as to whether it might be appropriate and possible, in line with our resolutions, to amend the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities as part of the new Treaty provisions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0248/2003) by François Zimeray, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for upholding of the immunity and privileges of Mr Francesco Musotto (2002/2201(IMM))."
"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I fully agree, of course, with what the rapporteur has just said."
"I would, however, like to point out to you, Mr President, and to the House, a further consideration which the rapporteur, not being of Italian origin, was not able to highlight."
"Mr Musotto is already on trial in Italy for this incident."
"In this situation, and in many similar situations too, a principle is being overlooked inasmuch as we take as a basis - or some people do - the erroneous interpretation of what is, in actual fact, the law."
"The Treaties lay down that we are all subject on national territory to the laws, and therefore the immunities, which apply to the national parliaments."
"In our case, however, we are not taking into account - or someone, in Mr Musotto's case, has not taken into account, and that is why I am pointing it out, Mr President - the fact that the immunity granted to the European Parliament - not to its Members but to Parliament itself - is, in any case, completely independent of national arrangements."
"No one - neither the Court nor the Public Prosecution Department which has opened the proceedings relating to Mr Musotto - has applied to the European Parliament for authorisation: there has been no request or notification."
"Mr Musotto has had to make the request and inform us of his situation himself; the Presidency and the Committee on Legal Affairs have expressed an opinion and the opinion will now, with tomorrow's vote, provided that it is still in line with the Committee on Legal Affairs' proposal, become a Parliamentary document."
"Mr President, it is essential that the outcome of tomorrow's vote is enforced outside this House too, where the Public Prosecution Department in question is concerned, for it is essential not just that it is clear to everybody but - seeing as so much hangs on that word 'immunity' in my country - that it is enforced as a general principle as well as in the case in point."
"Parliament is autonomous, and this has been practice and consolidated case law since Parliament was first established, since Parliament was elected by universal suffrage: too many people forget this."
"I therefore ask, Mr President, not just for the House's decision to be communicated to those to whom it directly relates but for a clear, precise, unambiguous principle to be established, which, thus far, has certainly not been followed by certain courts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"Mr President, this is not quite as dry or as difficult as the title makes it sound."
"I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their hard work on the amendments on the prospectus directive."
"I also wish to thank the Commission for the important facilitating role it has played in reaching what I hope will be an agreed set of amendments when they are voted on Wednesday, and to thank the Greek Presidency - and before that the Danish Presidency - for the preparation of this particular dossier."
"I hope we will have an overwhelming vote in favour of the compromise amendments, with the agreement of the Council, and that we will therefore have a prospectus directive later in July when the Ecofin Council meets again."
"This is a key part of the Financial Services Action Plan and of creating a single market in financial services."
"Instead of having to use 15 separate prospectuses to reach retail investors in the existing European Union, in future an issuer of bonds or shares will only need one."
"That will give a passport not just to 15 Member States but to 25 and a market of more than 400 million people."
"The single European market in new issues of shares and bonds is set to become a reality."
"This will lead to more competition and, therefore, greater choice for investors, cheaper capital for businesses, and more funding opportunities for many businesses that might be denied finance if they were limited to their national market."
"Moreover, this key advantage - a single passport - has been achieved without some of the less felicitous baggage that was originally contained in a somewhat rushed proposal from the Commission and that would have added to the regulatory burdens, particularly on smaller listed companies."
"This deal ensures that there is no mandatory shelf registration and that there is no mandatory annual updating, unless the issuer intends to continue issuing shares or bonds."
"This is a significant achievement for this Parliament in influencing the final shape of this legislation."
"Crucially this agreement also confirms the freedom that issuers of bonds have to go to different EU regulators for the approval of their prospectus, so long as the minimum denomination is EUR 1000 or more or, importantly, a nearly equivalent amount in other currencies, so that USD 1000 can also be a minimum amount."
"The euro markets raised USD 1.6 trillion equivalent of finance for business last year and 60% of that finance was in non-euro currencies such as the dollar and the yen."
"Europe is the proud home of the international capital market and this deal now gives that international market a way of bringing its benefits across to domestic investors too."
"The Council and the Commission have accepted the vast majority of the amendments passed by Parliament at its first reading in March 2002: on the choice of EU regulator for bonds, on a light touch for small and medium-sized businesses, on tailoring requirements to different issues, on lightening the burden on issues."
"Thanks to Parliament's insistence we have also reached compromise on the ability of national authorities to delegate approval of prospectuses to stock exchanges and others such as the nominated advisors in the aim market."
"There will be a review after five years and the Commission may reconsider the commitment to phasing out delegation after eight years."
"The political declaration from the Commission is important and it shows an open-mindedness faced with the evidence, which we would obviously expect."
"We have also made clear that both national authorities and stock exchanges may continue to insist on higher standards of disclosure and corporate governance as a requirement of listing, if they so wish."
"This should put some fears to rest."
"As regards the last-minute changes that were agreed only last week by the Council, we have also clarified that existing medium-term note programmes, a very important type of financing structure in the euro markets, can continue unchanged."
"Indeed they will now be extended beyond the four Member States which currently recognise them and will also benefit from the passport."
"This is a real breakthrough for the single market and this House can be proud of its influence in ensuring that the directive is an effective means of extending competition, choice and efficiency."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that this directive is fundamental for the functioning of primary markets in Europe and for our aim to build an integrated capital market by 2005."
"For the Commission, the prospectus proposal has two aims: to facilitate fund-raising for European issuers and to ensure adequate levels of investor protection."
"During the past two years this text has evolved significantly."
"There have been some important changes but the text maintains the necessary balance between facilitating for issuers and investor protection."
"The Commission amended its proposal to take account of Parliament's position."
"After first reading, 50 out of 62 amendments were taken on board by the Commission in its amended proposal."
"The Council's common position is broadly in line with this amended proposal."
"Today I should like to congratulate Parliament on its spirit of collaboration and its willingness to achieve convergence."
"We welcome the new amendments tabled by the rapporteur, together with the following Members of Parliament: Mrs Kauppi, Mr Ettl, Mr Goebbels and Mr Blokland."
"I am very optimistic that they will be accepted also by the Council."
"I much appreciate Parliament's constructive spirit and I should like in particular to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, for all his work to get approval for this compromise proposal."
"In particular I should like to thank him for his report and for the 21 new amendments he has tabled."
"We can accept them in their entirety, as we consider that they improve the text of the common position and contribute towards achieving the goals set by the proposal."
"In this context, we reject the first 47 amendments tabled, since those which could be accepted - even partially or in spirit - by the Commission are now covered by the 21 new amendments."
"Regarding more particularly Amendment Nos 50 and 67, related to delegation of tasks from a competent authority to an exchange, I confirm that the Commission in the review to be conducted in accordance with Article 21 will also examine the conditions relating to the sunset period in the same article."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment Nos 69 to 71 since they provide for preferential treatment with respect to banks, and this is against the philosophy of the directive."
"Such treatment would create discrimination towards other institutions and distort competition."
"That is something the Commission objects to."
"Finally, I should like to thank the Greek presidency for its most valuable efforts to reach agreement on this matter now."
"It is an important and highly significant achievement."
"We must now use our remaining energy reserves to resolve the investment services, transparency and, of course, take-overs directives by the April 2004 deadline."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Huhne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by giving Mrs Kauppi's apologies."
"She regrets that her flight cannot get her here yet, and so she has asked me to stand in for her."
"We know that this directive is an important part of the financial services action plan."
"What are this action plan's strategic objectives for the financial internal market?"
"The first is that a single wholesale market for financial services should be guaranteed; the second is the creation of open and safe retail markets, and the third is the modernisation of the rules of compliance and of the way in which they are monitored."
"What is today's debate about?"
"Today we are debating the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading."
"What do we mean by a prospectus?"
"By that we mean a document published when shares or bonds are issued, containing those items of information considered necessary to investors."
"What does the directive aim at?"
"It aims to introduce a single passport for prospectuses, approved by the authorities in the country of origin and subsequently recognised throughout the EU for the purposes of the public offering of securities and/or their admission to trading on regulated markets."
"In place of the fifteen separate authorisations still required despite two directives on the subject, only one authorisation will be required under the new directive for what will be the twenty-five Member States of the European Union."
"I would like to extend very warm thanks to the rapporteur, to the shadow rapporteurs of all the groups, and also to the chairman of the committee, for the great deal of time and effort that they have devoted to this."
"Last Thursday, when we were in a conference call, we were in fact even more divided, but it was possible, on the Friday, for us to make a conciliation committee unnecessary; I think this right and proper, as we have no idea whether the conciliation committee would have enabled us to make any progress or might indeed have jeopardised this important directive."
"The six major successes achieved by Parliament mean that we can say yes to the compromise."
"As early as first reading stage, we managed to add the sunset clause to the Lamfalussy procedure, to produce a better definition of professional investors and to take greater account of small and medium-sized firms."
"At second reading stage, and in recent days, we succeeded in getting a free choice of supervisory authority for non-dividend-bearing securities with a denomination per unit of at least EUR 1 000, which amounts, de facto, to a free choice of supervisory authority."
"We managed to get the deadlines for authorisation reduced; it is still possible for supervisory authorities to delegate; and the position will be reviewed after five years."
"If, though, the Commission's report after these five years is an unfavourable one - which I do not expect it will be - the option of delegation will have to lapse after eight years, so that, here too, we have improved the Common Position along the lines desired by Parliament."
"This does not mean that everything has been sorted out."
"It is a cause of anguish to me that there are two things that have not been achieved."
"One is a rule on basic prospectuses for all banks issuing shares, for which I campaigned."
"Here - as is, indeed, stated in the recitals - it was not possible to do justice to the aim of this directive, that being to speed the process up."
"The directive has rather missed the mark here."
"The second thing that did not get through - although this was adopted with the support of all groups in this House - was the increase in maximum value for each issuer from EUR 50 to EUR 100, in respect of which exceptions are possible."
"That would have been a help especially for states such as Austria and Germany, where no prospectus is at present required below this threshold."
"Although it is unfortunate that we did not succeed in this, the compromise is, all in all, a good one, and we will therefore be supporting it."
"Mr President, it really does take a lot of self-restraint, following this overture by Mr Huhne and Commissioner Bolkestein, not to let a note of discord disturb their duet."
"It falls to me, in any case, to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, even if - as far as the outcome is concerned - I do not entirely share his opinion."
"The directive on prospectuses for securities forms, without any doubt, an important part of the financial services action plan."
"If they are to obtain finance on the capital market, businesses need these reliefs, which they had expected."
"As we are also dealing with this matter under some pressure of time, I would be the last to want this issue to go to a conciliation committee."
"We - that is, the Economic Affairs Committee - believe that conciliation under Italian aegis could not bring about any fundamental improvements to the status quo."
"It is still the case - and we are to vote on this as soon as tomorrow - that countries such as Italy, Spain, and France too, have certain reservations as regards points of detail in the European prospectus, about which you will hear more later."
"I believe that, yet again, the Council and the Commission, in discussions on what is a typical codecision issue, are showing themselves to take a less flexible approach to this elementary question of financial markets than this House might have been able to expect."
"Our approach and our thinking were in every respect guided by the practice of the market, so that, if I am able to recommend approval of this second-reading compromise, it is more on the basis of the general weighing of the interests involved."
"To be able to provide one single information document valid throughout the EU is, though, surely to the advantage of businesses that introduce shares, or make offers to buy, on European stock exchanges."
"It is obvious, though, that, in dealing with this matter, we have to consider the transparency of securities markets and, to an increasing extent, the protection of small investors and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A procedure that is as simple and cheap as possible when it comes to the amount of an enterprise's data that are required and the way in which they are to be updated, is meant to make for easier access to capital markets."
"That is what we need."
"To some extent - or almost exclusively - we have done justice to this, but our desire to extend, on the basis of liability, protection of small investors by defining responsibilities more clearly - with reference, for example, to analysts or chief accountants - has, unfortunately, met with rejection."
"Equally unfortunately, the issue of the venue of jurisdiction has found no clear resolution."
"Issuers were allowed to have recourse to the courts in their own countries, an advantage denied to investors."
"This may well continue to be a live issue."
"It is unfortunate that this immovability, which was not necessary in this case, has resulted in no further progress in the issues in the financial services sector that the public really care about."
"Nor were the prevailing customary practices on European markets followed when it came to convertible debentures."
"Had these been unambiguously defined, as had indeed been proposed, quality improvements would have followed, because, for example, the right to convert would have gone to the owner of the securities."
"This is also highly significant in terms of Basle II, as this type of financial instrument is likely to become more popular."
"It baffles me, Commissioner, how a minimum framework of information for regional and local authorities presenting prospectuses for loans in all the EU's Member States, could come to be regarded as a hindrance rather than as a good thing."
"A measure of this sort would be of additional value in view of the EU's enlargement."
"I regard that as regrettable, but at least other points were accepted, among them the choice of a minimum nominal value of EUR 1 000 or USD 1 000 - now determined by reference to the market - for all loans."
"The temporary solution of eight years - with the office authorising the prospectus allowing certain tasks to be delegated to the stock exchanges - is of no small significance to smaller financial markets and is a good way of dealing with this."
"Last but not least, we can go along with what has been negotiated."
"Congratulations to the rapporteur, and no clashing discords to the Commissioner."
"Mr President, the proposed arrangements have a dual purpose."
"First, to restore the shaken climate of confidence of small working-class investors in the institution of the stock exchange, so that grass-roots savings can continue to be plundered unimpeded and, secondly, to set up a regulatory framework for the action of the big investors."
"In other words, the aim is to consolidate the stock exchange as a mechanism for concentrating capital and safeguarding a quick, easy profit for monopoly groups."
"The proposals for measures to be taken are not at all convincing."
"In its communication, the Commission talks of practices which will improve the reliability of the market and help to attract capital, in other words, they will allay the fears of small investors so that they can plunder their savings with impunity."
"Having succeeded in sweetening them with a taste of the profits so that they gamble all their savings, by applying the idea of easy money, they have also managed to turn their heads by inciting them to raise gambling to an art form."
"So far, not only have no substantial control measures been taken, but also recent repeated scandals have revealed that even these very control mechanisms have advocated cheating by adopting creative accounting methods, and as a result the savings of the working classes, the capital of small investors and pension funds have grown wings and flown into the coffers of the monopoly groups, which grow rich in this parasitical manner."
"The history to date of the stock exchange and of the control mechanisms relating to it show that it is the place where 'big fish eats little fish' applies absolutely."
"The myth that state controls can limit speculation in the very temple of speculation has now been exposed."
"Only an economic and political way out that puts grass-roots needs first and socialises the basic means of production constitutes a promising prospect for safeguarding grass-roots incomes today."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the prospectus directive that is before us."
"Its importance lies in its regulation of the issue of European Passports for the prospectuses, which will enable securities to be marketed right across the European Union's internal market."
"If a prospectus is authorised by a competent national authority, this authorisation will, as we know, be valid in all other Member States."
"This means that the European Passport will save the issuers a lot of expense and administrative effort."
"As I have already said, this directive is one of the most important components of the Commission's action plan, which aims to establish an internal market in the area of financial services."
"In December 2002, the Commission estimated that the creation of an efficient internal market in securities would result in a 1.1% growth in gross domestic product."
"I hope they are right in saying this, as we could all do with a spurt of growth under present circumstances."
"The recommendation for second reading, as presented to plenary, is a fine document."
"I would like to express my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, as the text improves two important aspects of the Common Position about which I am personally concerned."
"One is that this text allows the issuers, from a denomination per unit of EUR 1 000 and upwards, to choose, when it comes to the approval of the prospectus, between, firstly, the competent authority of the Member State in which the issuer's registered office is situated; secondly, that of the Member State in which the securities are authorised to be traded on a regulated market; or, thirdly, that of the Member State in which the securities are offered to the public."
"Having EUR 1 000 as the denomination per unit is far more realistic than the threshold value of EUR 5 000 estimated by the Council, as it will be small investors that will have a particular interest in it."
"So I am very much in favour of this and hope that it will not be watered down still further."
"I am given to understand that it still stands even after the compromise with the Council."
"Secondly, this text allows the competent authorities to delegate the examination of the prospectus to other bodies possessing the necessary expertise."
"In small Member States in particular - both present and future ones - the tradition is that prospectuses are examined by the stock exchanges."
"Responsibility remains, of course with the competent state authorities, whilst stock exchanges do have the necessary highly-qualified staff."
"In Luxembourg, we had great difficulties finding experts with Luxembourg nationality, as the officials of the supervisory authorities have to be Luxembourg nationals, so I am glad that this delegation does not lapse after five years, but will be checked by the Commission to see if it still works."
"Rather than sharing Mrs Berès' view, I am convinced that this examination will not produce adverse judgments; we will not end up, after eight years, with a delegation of this sort becoming inevitably impossible."
"I very much want to underline once more how significant this directive is, and I am glad that Commissioner Bolkestein has told us that he can go along with the twenty-one compromise amendments on which the rapporteur and the Commission have agreed."
"I would again like to thank Mr Huhne most warmly for the work he has done, which has been of real value, and for his sympathetic attitude, particularly to the concerns that I raised and which, it is to be hoped, will soon be dealt with in the way I have described."
"If that happens, we will soon have a proper directive, one that will be of great importance to the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"Mr President, if compromise is about being able to live with views which are not entirely your own then the rapporteur has done tremendously well in terms of handling the debate within the House and within the committee, with the Commission and with the Council."
"He certainly listened to his colleagues and I congratulate him for his sensitivity."
"As Mr Ettl said, raising capital is vital, and it is more vital perhaps for small businesses where delicate problems can cause immense harm."
"The protection of businesses from disproportionate costs is surely vital and the attempt which has been made to steer this text towards a more balanced approach effects what I believe is the long-term security for this market."
"An obvious example, which was mentioned by Mrs Villiers, is on shelf registration, which could have caused tremendous harm and has been avoided."
"I also fought hard against this."
"I believe that is a great success."
"I would also like to mention, rather than going into the details which have been repeated so much, the risk capital action plan of which this is a part as well, and I am always keen to make sure we cross-reference."
"It is part of the Lisbon goals for growth for all our economies."
"The single market helps create the potential for such growth."
"As a past rapporteur on the risk capital action plan, I am pleased to see it has completed its passage through this House and I am pleased that it has been completed successfully so far."
"As the Commissioner says, there are other reports to come and I hope that they will reflect the same level of debate that we have heard for this particular report."
"It was not perfect when it reached this House - very rarely things are of course, which allows us to stay in the job we are in - and I believe that Parliament has handled it supremely well and this demonstrates the maturity which it can lend to such technical reports."
"I look forward therefore to our discussion on the transparency directive, which, as you now know, has been given to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"As the rapporteur I look forward to a very vital debate, as we will expect for the completion of the financial services action plan that this directive will be pointed at as well."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the European Passport for issues of securities will, in future, make it easier to raise capital."
"This proposal is one of our contributions to the removal of bureaucracy and of the other barriers that mean that a financial internal market is still not yet feasible."
"I have to say that there has been very constructive cooperation between the institutions, and this has been made easier by the rapporteur's willingness to compromise; we have all had to agree on formulations in order to produce a watertight piece of legislation."
"I think it was a great stroke of genius for us to draw a distinction between equity and non-equity securities."
"That was a smart move, for which I am sure that, one day, both investors and issuers will be grateful to us."
"When we do actually adopt a directive, it will be important for us always to attempt to balance the interests of the issuers and those of investors."
"In this directive, this House has again attached great value to the protection of small investors, who have in recent years been particularly unsettled, and we are obliged to restore small investors' confidence if we really do want to have a properly-functioning internal financial market from which everyone can benefit."
"The three things that are important are, firstly, that every investor will in future be able to rely on the prospectus underlying an issue complying with high standards of quality, without regard to the issuer's home country and also without reference to the country in which the security is offered."
"This will become a selling point."
"The second is that, in the course of negotiations, we were able to make it a requirement that the summary prospectus, which is the main source of information for small investors, should comply with high standards and form part of the prospectus."
"If the summary is false, misleading or inconsistent, it must be possible, in consequence of this, for those responsible to be brought to account."
"Thirdly, the investor is protected against misleading advertising, in that it is ensured that issuers, when describing their product in the media, cannot promise more than the security can hold in accordance with the prospectus."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention one concern that again became very apparent when this directive was under discussion, and that is the question of whether Parliament's rights have actually been safeguarded."
"If I consider the Interinstitutional Agreement in the light of better regulation, I have my doubts about this, so you can be sure that we will consider very carefully whether the work that you and CESAR do on this particular directive meets our expectations and is within the framework we have set."
"If you were to fully meet Parliament's expectations, that would build confidence in the legislation to be derived from this in future, and in secondary legislation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be on Wednesday."
". (IT) Mr President, we are addressing in this part-session - the vote is to be held on Wednesday - a reform which, because of the interest it has raised and the debate it has prompted, is certainly one of the key elements of this legislature and one of the key stages in the opening up of the markets and the implementation of the internal market in Europe."
"We are approaching second reading after overcoming a number of difficulties encountered recently with translations and amendments - even now, this evening, the facility for tabling amendments is open until 7 p.m; in fact, it is about to close."
"In any case, this issue is of such significance as to require some in-depth comments."
"We have conducted a lengthy debate, both direct and indirect, with the Commission."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein and all the members of his staff for losing no time in addressing the issue."
"We have worked on it together on many occasions, outside the Chamber, outside Parliament but within the institutions, in an attempt to achieve the best possible outcome."
"I would like to thank all the Members who have made useful contributions through their interest, their input and the amendments they have deemed it necessary to table."
"It is a major, important reform which is coming to the end of the Parliamentary process after a period which has lasted for almost the whole of this legislature."
"Simplification, the alignment of technological and social development and the completion of the internal market were and are still the imperative goals driving Parliament."
"Debate, dialogue and the diversity of political positions and national interests have stimulated and shaped the conclusions."
"Public works, public supply and public service contracts account for EUR 1400 billion each year in the Union, which means and shows that this legislation concerns the very powerhouse of the Community's economy."
"We are drawing up general, fundamental rules, on the basis of which specific national rules will be laid down."
"These general rules must contain principles which will be useful to all, not just to a few, which will be useful to the Community as a whole, not just to partisan lobbies; rules which will provide certainty, transparency, fair competition and an internal market which is open to all."
"Procurement rules cannot and must not differ according to the value: administrative procedures may differ above or below an appropriate threshold, but the principles cannot differ."
"At present, the thresholds mean that only about an eighth of the sum I quoted relates to European competitions."
"The rest is lost because of national or regional regulations."
"For this reason, I for my part acknowledge that the thresholds should be abolished."
"However, since that cannot happen, a requirement has been proposed which, moreover, already exists indirectly, according to which the basic principles of the legislation must, at any event, always be observed, including by independent territorial legislation."
"It is necessary for all possible procedures to be modernised and for the use of increasingly rapidly developing technologies to be permitted and codified."
"The awarding bodies will thus benefit from the proposals made, adopting electronic systems not just for the management of competitions and the receiving of bids but for the actual auctions too."
"Of course, auctions are required to be limited to the purchasing of codified, standardised materials."
"We want firms' freedom of organisation to be accorded due value and made use of, with every possibility of subcontracting left open for that share of the work which, once identified, can be entrusted to firms for whom the principal contractor is answerable."
"In order not to complicate participation in the competition, it is appropriate for partners to be identified after the work has been subcontracted."
"The complex issue - and this has been a very controversial point - of awarding design and execution contracts jointly, appreciated and appreciable for some specific categories of contracts, cannot be a hard and fast rule."
"It is clearly appropriate and natural to separate services and works, just as it can be clearly appropriate and natural to treat them jointly, subject to prior justification."
"By respecting this principle we are consolidating qualitative competition too, which would otherwise be in danger of being squeezed out in a purely economic and technological context, being moreover the prerogative of the company alone and therefore not always beneficial to the contracting authority."
"This principle is the basis for the rapporteur's proposals."
"We must remember that we are dealing with a directive which is of high and singular economic importance and, as such, cannot and must not contain rules or principles which are governed by specific legislation such as specific social or environmental requirements."
"The environmental and social dimensions have processes which are defined and can be defined specifically and therefore made mandatory by means of other vehicles and in other contexts."
"However, some principles are laid down and proposed in the provision which refer particularly to respect for the needs of disadvantaged groups and the legislation on safety in the workplace."
"The environment - the great victim of our time - is also dealt with exhaustively. Any further excesses in this area are to be avoided."
"With contracts being awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous price, there has to be a weighting criterion properly defined in calls for tenders, in that, otherwise, there would be a discretionary power in the a posteriori application of parameters which has created many legal problems throughout Community territory in the past."
"The confidentiality of information which, according to the pre-established procedures, is provided to the contracting entity by the interested parties will be protected and safeguarded by specific rules."
"As regards 'in-house' contracts, there are conflicting points of view: the representatives of producers' associations are decidedly against reserving contracts for an enterprise of which the contracting entity is part, even if it has independent legal personality, without a competition, and your rapporteur agrees with them."
"It has been proposed to extend the causes of exclusion where there are sentences for subsequent offences relating to the tendering company on grounds of bankruptcy, unfair behaviour, failure to respect collective work contracts or drug dealing."
"Lastly, it has been proposed to set up an independent agency to provide control mechanisms for contracts in the Member States."
"Without prejudice to the possibility of instigating legal proceedings, we hope that this agency will be able to verify the procedures followed and also be able to cancel awards which do not comply with the legislation."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the content of the rules under debate, because of their economic significance and because of their employment, social, environmental and economic implications, can be described without any shadow of doubt as essential to the organisation of modern-day society."
"Differing political positions and different political or bureaucratic points of view mean that a widely supported process is not possible."
"On the other hand, rejection and referral to committee or conciliation as the - not unproblematic - final stage in producing legislation is both possible and desirable."
"All this is in the interests of the Union and in the interests of an internal market which must become increasingly consolidated and transparent."
"The vote taken the day after tomorrow will confirm the democratic process, which there is no doubt that we must all follow."
". Mr President, I am happy that these two issues have now entered their second reading, as a quick but thorough examination is necessary to avoid the dangers of the proposals not being adopted before the end of this legislature."
"Our common task and aim is to modernise and simplify public procurement rules and in this respect I believe that the texts agreed upon in Council already strike a fair balance among the different interests at stake."
"Indeed, although there are a few issues that the Commission considers less than ideal, overall these common positions clearly represent an advance compared to the current legislation."
"When I look at the substance of most of the amendments tabled to date by Parliament I feel even more convinced of what I said just now."
"I am therefore fairly optimistic that the vote due to take place later this week will preserve our chances of closing this file in a way that is satisfactory to all three institutions, indeed, in my view quite a number of amendments are already incorporated in one form or another in the common positions."
"I refer for example to the social aspects - other than social award criteria - where I understand that the main concern of this Parliament is to clarify that both contracting authorities and bidders respect the obligations laid down in social legislation."
"That concern was also explicitly debated with Council."
"It is therefore in my view appropriately reflected in the recitals of the current text."
"I am ready to accept that it should be mandatory for contracting authorities and entities to indicate where information on the applicable social, fiscal and environmental obligations may be obtained."
"Equally, with some redrafting, the Commission could accept Amendment No 29 to the public sector - or classic - directive and Amendment No 26 to the utilities directive, which emphasise certain possibilities which already exist in the social field."
"As for the environmental aspects and in general on the issue of award criteria, the amendments which Parliament has tabled clearly show some differing views."
"I am ready, as always, to debate further this interesting issue with Parliament through answers to questions, though in respect of the real aim of public procurement rules, as interpreted and confirmed by the European Court of Justice."
"Indeed, I have no doubt that we all agree that our priority is to make public procurement rules a simplified tool for public bodies to spend taxpayers' money as well as possible."
"These differences of views have often meant that conflicting amendments have been adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which, if accepted, would make legislation incoherent."
"We should perhaps all keep in mind our common stated goal of 'better regulation'."
"This inconsistency is well illustrated by the amendments to the utilities directive concerning award criteria."
"Let us start by looking at how the common positions deal with this issue."
"In full accordance with the current state of jurisprudence, the common positions already clarify that environmental characteristics may be used as award criteria and that it is not necessary to show that each and every award criterion taking individually provides an economic benefit for the contracting authorities or entities."
"It is sufficient that, taken as a whole, the award criteria meet their proper function: to allow an objective evaluation and comparison of the intrinsic qualities of the product or service and the award of the contract to the most economically advantageous tender."
"It is, therefore, with some concern that I see amendments to the utilities directive that would go well beyond this."
"The effect of such amendments would be to allow vague, immeasurable elements, for the benefit of civil society in the broadest sense, to be used as award criteria."
"That would not only prevent award criteria from playing their proper role, but also introduce an unacceptable degree of arbitrary choice, or perhaps even discrimination to the detriment of potential contractors."
"In respect of social award criteria, we should also keep in mind that the common positions already clarify that such criteria may be used where they meet the same conditions as environmental award criteria."
"However, these amendments to the utilities directive would permit social award criteria to be used to meet social policy objectives concerning the behaviour or the social responsibility of the tenderer, rather than the intrinsic qualities of the product or service in question."
"This could lead to the award of contracts on the basis of considerations which have nothing to do with the principal of better value for money."
"On the amendments aimed at favouring small and medium enterprises, I should like to stress that information available to us does not show that SMEs currently encounter any major difficulty in gaining access to public tenders."
"Their European federation even told us that they would not support any positive discrimination in favour of SMEs vis-à-vis big enterprises."
"In general, we should all be careful not to introduce changes which might de facto lead to national preferences which are incompatible with Community law and which might end up protecting economic interests."
"Let me draw the attention of Parliament to the sensitive issue of thresholds, which may be the one where our divergence of views may be very hard to reconcile."
"My aim is to ensure effective competition at European level."
"If we increase the thresholds, not only would we breach our international obligations, but we would also reduce efficiencies."
"If we raise the thresholds we do not necessarily simplify life for local authorities, which are in any case subject to an obligation of adequate publicity under the current case-law of the European Court of Justice."
"That is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments."
"In line with the interinstitutional agreement on better regulation we have recently reached, we all share the three objectives on modernising, simplifying and increasing the flexibility of the current rules."
"It is in this spirit that I have some reluctance in accepting some further amendments relating to different subjects such as e-auctions, framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems, the competitive dialogue and the choice between separate or joint awarding of contracts for design and execution of works contracts."
"In fact, I fear that these amendments would multiply or complicate procedures unnecessarily or impose certain choices at Community level where the necessary flexibility could be better assured by making such choices possible at the national level."
"I should now like to say something on some central issues specific to the utilities directive."
"Concerning the amendments to the mechanism for exempting contracting entities from the directive - Article 30 of the common position - let me stress that the common position is based on two principles, legal certainty and real, effective liberalisation."
"The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the presence of genuine competition should be established by a known procedure."
"Otherwise, neither contracting entities nor interested suppliers would be sure of their legal position."
"The Commission is also opposed to other initiatives regarding specific sectors, which would permit exclusion on the basis of free access alone, irrespective of whether or not this results in effective and real competition."
"For essentially the same reasons, the Commission cannot accept the proposed changes concerning postal services."
"Finally, concerning the 'intra-group' exception of Article 23, the Commission already made it clear that it has major difficulties in accepting the extension of this exclusion to works and supply contracts."
"It does not however, want to make the directive less flexible than it already is."
"For that reason, the Commission can accept the fact that the extension to works and supplies contracts should be eliminated, but not that contracting entities should be deprived of the existing flexibility for services."
"In concluding I repeat that I am confident that by focusing on our main common goals to modernise, simplify and ensure an effective use of public money, we can provide a happy ending to the long saga of this reform to public procurement rules."
"This result is impatiently awaited by European enterprises, public authorities and contracting entities."
"It will be of great benefit to the European economy as a whole."
"Finally, may I point out that the Commission's opinion on the individual amendments has been provided in writing"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will refer to Commissioner Bolkestein's article in last Saturday's 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' - an article, Commissioner, that you published under your own name - and from which, with your permission, I will quote just one extract: 'It is important that authorities should get the highest possible return on taxpayers' money, and that this important economic sphere should be fully opened up to competition in the internal market, as open and competitive procurement guarantees an improvement in services of general interest, ensures that public goods are used effectively, prevents corruption and stimulates both economic growth and the creation of jobs'."
"On that, Commissioner, I can back you 100%; the only problem I have is that I am one of those who believe that what we have received from the Council as a Common Position fails to comply with these very requirements and conditions."
"I am one of those who take the view that the existing laws on procurement in the European Union have worked so far; they are written down in four directives, to which one must add the settled case-law of the European Court of Justice, which was handed down over many years, and which has proved its value."
"We have doubts as to whether this Common Position, this Council document, is indeed suited to maintaining the quality we have hitherto enjoyed."
"Many of us are concerned that the new elements in this directive have not reduced the danger of manipulation, but will end up increasing it."
"Many are worried that we will have, not more competition, but less."
"Referring back to this article, let me point out that the representatives of industry to whom I have spoken, were not concerned that this document might result in increased competition, but that there could end up being less of it."
"I believe that most of my group's amendments had the specific aim in mind of improving a whole array of crucial points in this directive."
"Another aspect I would like to address is that of the environmental and social criteria, which, as I am well aware, are matters of great contention in this House."
"I do maintain, though, that European legislation should be right in terms of the legal system, and what that means is that I deal with environmental issues under the heading of environmental legislation and use legislation on social affairs to deal with social issues."
"The law on procurement is not part of environmental law, or of social security law; it has to do with business law, which means to say that the only issues to be considered in the field of procurement law are those of economic viability."
"It is for that reason that I have my own grave misgivings as to whether it is in any way right to deal here with issues relating to the environmental and social criteria."
"It is, though, evidently the majority view both in the Council and - to judge by the outcome of first reading - in this House, that if these matters are to be dealt with, we have to ensure that they are taken into account, not as part of the awarding of the contract, but in the criteria applying when the contract is put out to tender."
"I regard as unacceptable anything that, in relation to the award of the contract - independently, as it were, of what the various service providers knew when the contract was put out to tender - can end up resulting in further decision-making, or can make it possible for that to be manipulated."
"I speak not only for myself but also for my group when I say that I regret the fact that it has not been possible to come to a compromise beforehand between the groups on the issues raised by this proposal."
"The end result of this will be a political showdown between the political groups in this House, while the Commission and the Council of Ministers get their directives through; what I fear, quite simply, is that there is little prospect for qualified majorities on the reciprocal amendments."
"I question whether that is a good thing for this House or for Europe."
"That concludes the comments that I wanted to make on this proposal on behalf of my group."
"Mr President, during the first reading of the directives being put to the vote, the European Parliament fought vigorously for the incorporation of social and environmental criteria in the procedures for concluding public contracts, confirming its role as the champion of the European social model and sustainable development."
"To our great sorrow, we find that the Council's common position has not accepted many of our amendments, which is why we need to continue our fight and stand firm by our initial positions."
"Respect for the acquis communautaire on employment and environmental issues cannot be ignored in the procedure for concluding public contracts."
"It is not possible for the European Union to be indifferent to such commitments by the Member States in public contracts, when the quality of employment relations and, more generally, the quality of life is now a generally recognised aim of all its policies."
"In addition, just as we are willing to promote companies' social responsibilities in the private sector, it is inconsistent for Member States to be indifferent to issues that constitute companies' core social responsibilities when concluding public contracts."
"Thus, quality criteria can and must be taken into account by the contracting authorities as a matter of obligation."
"In the same spirit, infringement of the relevant obligations on the part of candidate companies must act as a reason to disqualify them from the procedure."
"We would also stress that it is not enough to refer to social and environmental criteria in the preamble, they must also be included in the regulatory text of the directive."
"The area of public contracts is also an ideal area for taking account of people with disabilities."
"We therefore welcome the amendment introducing the obligation for contracting authorities to take account of accessibility criteria for people with disabilities."
"To conclude, production agencies must understand that, by helping to implement European social policy, they do not incur an economic burden; on the contrary, they have economic benefits, such as subsidies when public contracts are awarded."
"Mr President, it is a very important matter that we discuss tonight, as Mr Bolkestein said."
"He urged us, in his closing words, to make sure that we modernise and simplify European Community law and endow it with appropriate flexibility."
"With this I believe we can all agree."
"The issue is: which exact text will best achieve that?"
"To establish the general orientation of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we thought that the Commission's original proposal was unduly timid and grudging on points such as the environmental and social points."
"We, and others in Parliament, urged a broader and more generous view - the one that was in due course confirmed by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki tramways case."
"That was a real advance."
"It was not just our view, but Parliament's view at first reading."
"Then we have the common position."
"To us, the common position seems to be in some measure a retreat from the high-water mark represented by Parliament's first reading position."
"We would like to see some aspects of that retreat again reversed."
"I accept Mr Bolkestein's point that the text, as it came to us from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is internally inconsistent."
"I would put that down to the fact that in committee we had an unstable and varying majority, which meant that there was no clear golden thread running through the text that came from the committee."
"But there is a way of restoring it to consistency, coherence and environmental and social sensibility, which is to adopt the string of amendments, which will pull it back towards Parliament's first reading position and again exhort the Council and the Commission to take a bold step that will continue to serve these valuable goals of modernisation, simplification and flexibility."
"My own group will put forward two amendments in particular relating to Article 53 where, for example, we will object to the idea that it must be a tender most economically advantageous for the contracting authorities."
"We are told that sometimes social or environmental criteria are vague."
"That seems to be fraught with vagueness - the insistence that it be, as it were, self-referentially back to the authority which is contracting."
"That would give rise to all manner of disputes."
"Leave it as we suggest: various criteria linked to the subject of the public contract in question."
"Do not leave out characteristics, including those relating to production methods or the tender as equal-treatment policy."
"If these are unacceptably vague then the whole of Community law is unacceptably vague because we are exhorted in the horizontal clauses of the Treaties to attend to these very values!"
"Let us be brave!"
"Let us go forward, colleagues!"
"Let us restore the kinds of values that we asserted in the first reading position."
"Let us get rid of the inconsistencies, but let us get rid of them in the right direction."
"What can this Parliament expect from a rapporteur at second reading?"
"What line is a parliamentary committee to take if the Council's Common Position differs from Parliament's position at first reading?"
"It is obvious that the key amendments, given this Parliament's political vision, should be re-tabled."
"At present, the promotion of sustainable economic development is high on our list of priorities."
"We must also take subsidiarity into account, which means that we must not hinder municipalities and regions unnecessarily."
"Studying the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I rubbed my eyes in disbelief."
"I had been used to a great deal, but the current product deserves to be marked down emphatically as a flop."
"Some arguments would be enough to make you laugh if they did not concern serious matters."
"What should we make, for example, of the justification to Amendment No 63: I quote: 'Giving a weighting to each criterion is unrealistic and too mathematical an approach'."
"It appears that multiplying and adding up are already higher maths for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"In summary, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not acquitted itself of its task effectively, and it is up to plenary to undo the damage with regard to how this Parliament is represented."
"A municipality should be entitled to take environmental criteria into consideration in the award of a public contract."
"It is with good reason that Helsinki won its case when it procured clean buses."
"It would surely be too crazy for words if it were not possible to draw a distinction between electricity generated in an environmentally-friendly way and other electricity."
"Lower authorities should be able to acquire sustainable products and services."
"This obviously also applies to the governments of the Member States."
"With a market share of 16% of the GDP, it is precisely the government that should advocate a policy that promotes sustainable products and services."
"If we were to overlook this, that would give a totally wrong signal to private industry, especially at a time when the latter is starting to gain an understanding of the need for sustainable products and services."
"The package of amendments, which I also signed on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, makes the directive acceptable from an environmental perspective, and the subsidiarity principle is respected."
"With this, we place the responsibility for a policy of sustainability firmly with governments that take concrete decisions as closely to the citizen as possible."
"As an MEP, I would not like to come face to face with a citizen who learns from his local councillor that 'Europe' does not allow him to secure environmentally responsible public contracts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the approach taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has tabled a large number of amendments to the Council's Common Position on the new rules for public contracts."
"We have already had many discussions in this House which have highlighted the need to support small businesses and the self-employed, along with the need for bureaucracy in tendering procedures to be reduced at the same time as transparency and comprehensibility are increased."
"Further economic and social progress in the Member States will depend on the fulfilment of both these important demands."
"Parliament's demand for threshold values for public contracts - depending of course on the utility involved - to be increased is absolutely justified if we want (a) to reduce the very high costs involved in tendering on a Europe-wide basis, and (b) to give small and medium-sized businesses better opportunities in the European Union."
"It goes without saying that this heading includes the amendments aimed at reserving 10% of the expenditure on public contracts for small and medium-sized enterprises and at increasing the threshold values in the event of authorities being parties to contracts for the work to be carried out."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, I really cannot see what you are getting at!"
"I think my group, along with the others, did the right thing in emphasising the importance of invitations to tender containing conditions relating to the management of the environment and guarantees of workers' health and safety."
"In principle, this is in line with the sustainability for which the Council opted in Göteborg in 2001, with the economy, ecology, and the social dimension being given equal priority."
"That someone should argue against that is something that I find utterly baffling."
"This must apply not only to the way in which the main contractors meet the specified criteria; it goes without saying that it must be binding on the sub-contractors as well."
"If firms do not produce evidence of how they deal with finances and with their staff, their tenders should be rejected."
"I do, though, have doubts about compliance with data protection provisions when contracts are put out to tender electronically."
"We also support the demand that enterprises or persons who have been declared bankrupt or against whom court cases are pending should be excluded from tendering for public contracts."
"Rather than this being merely a permitted option, there should be binding rules on this."
"It stands to reason that exclusion from tendering for public contracts should also be extended to enterprises that had breached the conditions of tender on previous contracts."
"I also ask my fellow Members of this House, when plenary votes on Article 27, to adopt the version of the text included in the Council's Common Position, for if we do not, then 98.5 % of German collective wage agreements would be excluded as a criterion in invitations to tender, which would put German workers at a disadvantage when competing for the award of contracts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what we are dealing with here in these procurement directives is very definitely a multi-faceted problem."
"In the brief time available to me, I would like to consider two aspects of it."
"My first point is that we must fix the threshold values at the level that Parliament wanted at first reading stage."
"Having them even higher would have been desirable, as experience shows that Europe-wide tendering brings with it a lot of bureaucracy and higher costs that bear no relation to the relatively few offers that are put in."
"What I particularly want is for the costs and administrative burdens that international tendering entails to be kept down for public contracting authorities, primarily in local government."
"It was regrettable that, at first reading, we managed an increase only from EUR 5 million to EUR 7 million, for example in building contracts, and the governments in the Council now want to reduce this at second reading."
"Our second reading amendments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market held out for at least these EUR 7 million."
"I very much regret the fact that the demand for a higher - and actually reasonable - threshold value than EUR 7 million is unlikely to be possible in the final reading of the Procurement Directive."
"What is every bit as important to me as playing for millions with the threshold value in the directive on European procurement is the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises from unfair competition."
"Our self-employed, who abide by the law, must not have life made difficult for them by competitors who keep neither to collective wage agreements nor within the current labour law or health and safety provisions, and who do not give a fig for protecting the environment."
"In so doing, we would be attaching a high value to local self-government, and rightly so, for it is clear that local authorities are the political level closest to the public."
"Mr Bolkestein, you were right to say that taxpayers' money must be spent in the best way possible."
"I agree with you on that."
"However, that does not necessarily mean the cheapest on offer."
"'Best possible' carries connotations of quality and sustainability, in other words, due regard for social, environmental and other issues."
"Mr President, I shall concentrate on the proposal to award contracts for the supply of water."
"In Denmark, the supply of water is decentralised and based on a principle of solidarity where accessibility and prices are concerned."
"In Denmark, the water supply is owned by the consumer and managed locally, and those are very important prerequisites for being able to guarantee that water sources and the environment continue to be protected."
"Water is a public good."
"It must not be part of a strategy for the internal market or a means of promoting European industry."
"In the future, those who control the water supply will be those who wield power over people and money."
"The multinational companies are exceptionally aware of this, and there is money to be made in this area."
"It is estimated that, in the EU alone, the market is worth EUR 80 billion per year and that, in 15 years' time, large monopolies will control 65-75% of what are now public water supplies."
"A number of directives, including the two we are debating today, have now incorporated water as a commodity and are in the process of standardising countries' water supplies with the purpose of liberalising them and guaranteeing that drinking water is subject to free competition throughout the internal market."
"Experience in the UK and elsewhere is frightening. It demonstrates that, when the water supply is turned into a commodity and privatised, interest in the protection of resources also disappears."
"In fact, London's private water suppliers lobbied enthusiastically, and on equal terms with the European chemical industry, for our simply allowing larger quantities of crop sprays in drinking water when the EU negotiated limit values."
"The world's total accessible fresh water resources are scarce."
"There are now already countries in which it is drinking water, rather than food, that is in short supply."
"Liberalising the water supply would mean that the fight for water would overtake that for oil."
"That is a frightening prospect."
"At the moment, the EU is impeding Denmark's efforts to safeguard our groundwater against pollution, while the EU is in the process of lifting a number of the bans on pesticides imposed in Denmark."
"The EU must not also destroy the Danish principle according to which the water supply must be public and always owned by the consumer and managed by the owner - an important and crucial prerequisite for security of supply and the protection of water sources."
"It must be up to the individual country democratically to decide which model they wish to adopt for the supply of their water."
"Another little thing that naturally pleases me, since I live on one of Denmark's many small islands, is that it has now been realised how completely useless it is to invite tenders for the running of our little ferries and that the process has now begun of drawing up a specific directive exempting these small ferries from the awarding of contracts."
"This is something I of course very much welcome, but it illustrates the fact that there is something fundamentally wrong with the EU's demand for tenders to be invited in connection with every task."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on public procurement now before us is supposed to reflect the outcome of intensive negotiations extending over a period of years."
"It appears from this debate that the opinion-forming process is not yet complete."
"In committee, too, we were constantly arguing whether it is possible to modify the Council's Common Position, or whether, in order to improve it, we first have to reject it."
"This is a case in which I have to say that, for my own country, Austria, the advantages of this directive outweigh its disadvantages, not least because, on 1 September 2002, we implemented a new procurement law which owes much to the directive and to the draft directive."
"Whilst, on the one hand, the new rules modernise procurement legislation, the directives also incorporate important clarifications for their practical implementation, and the result is meant to be more transparent and fairer invitations to tender."
"I want, briefly, to consider four points."
"Firstly, the provision for the possible use of electronic media strikes me as being particularly important."
"The introduction of e-procurement is one of the new directive's key elements, and from the new electronic procurement instruments we can expect sustained good progress."
"These instruments should, however, apply solely to standardised goods and services."
"My second point is that, in Austria, there is in fact opposition to the increase in threshold values, as this would go against the opening-up of central, regional and local markets for procurement and, even today, covers only a small percentage of the contracts awarded under the EU's procurement system."
"We take the view that any further increase over and above what was proposed in the Common Position would restrict the scope of the directive, which is, after all, aimed at producing greater transparency and more fairness in invitations to tender."
"I would like to mention, thirdly, the newly introduced procurement procedures and rules for central procurement offices, which make it possible to have a system of procurement organised on modern lines."
"Fourthly, let me say something about the disagreement on secondary purposes."
"One reason why I have no problem with these is that Austrian procurement law takes secondary purposes into account, although there is no target set by law."
"I see it, however, as a requirement that all secondary purposes should be relevant to the contract, which means that they have a direct connection with it; any alternative is a recipe for arbitrariness on the part of the body awarding the contract and for the foreclosure of the market."
"If there are to be secondary purposes, they must be clearly defined, and that cannot be done anonymously."
"Although I do not know what the outcome of tomorrow's vote will be, I do believe it to be important that we should get this procurement law, and as quickly as possible, as it will benefit the internal market, bring about greater transparency, and make for more fairness."
"In the debate between Council and Parliament on the award of public markets in the European Union, the eye is instantly caught by the extent to which the bitterest enemies of state control forget their reservations as soon as the contest for state contracts begins."
"State money attracts them."
"How could the great construction and public works consortiums have built their financial empires, indeed, without state contracts?"
"How would armaments consortiums survive if there were no public money?"
"The so-called market economy is on a life-support machine, kept alive by the state on a saline drip."
"It is no coincidence that public market harmonisation is progressing so slowly."
"The big industrial cartels would like to keep access to their own state's money hostage even as they lay their hands on the public money of the country next door."
"As to the conditions for award of markets, the rules which are beginning to emerge reflect, in their desiccated bureaucratism, a cynicism bordering on sincerity."
"Under these conditions for the award procedure, the monetary value of the offer is the only thing that matters."
"Environmental and health requirements have been forgotten, to the justifiable indignation of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. The same fate has befallen working conditions and workers' remuneration in the companies which are pocketing public money."
"Also forgotten are so many other aspects, such as archaeological research."
"Forgotten, last of all, are the interests of society in general."
"Returns are all that counts."
"Social organisation has been reduced to a balance sheet."
"Furthermore, under the pretext of coordinating procedures in the water, energy, transport and postal service markets, the Council is trying to enshrine these as intrinsically no more than that: markets, rather than vital services for the whole of society."
"No!"
"Those water, energy and transport services, those postal services, must be and remain public services. They cannot be surrendered to these private groups, who are concerned with their own profits and not with the interests of users."
"Commissioner, I listened to your introductory speech carefully and have tried to understand what lies at the heart of our differences."
"We are of course in agreement with you on the aims of simplification, modernisation and proper use of public finances."
"Who would not be?"
"You forget other aims, however. My fellow ecologists and I have reminded you what they are: the aims of sustainable development."
"We feel that public markets and the means by which they are awarded are extremely important levers for realising those aims."
"Why do you reject, as you have pointed out, the amendment introduced by us to Article 53(1) of the classic directive, in which we allude to environmental characteristics, but also to modes of production?"
"Why refuse to allow the contracting authorities to give preference to modes of production based on rational use of energy, for example?"
"That seems incredible to me."
"Furthermore, in Article 23 of the directive, why refuse to refer to another aspect of Community legislation, European eco-labels, justifying yourself by arguing that these are a non-mandatory set of guidelines?"
"Very well, then."
"Make the aforesaid guidelines into one of the criteria for awarding public markets and encourage businesses to respect this type of eco-label. That would fit in perfectly with the aim of introducing an integrated sustainable development programme, an aim promoted by the European Parliament and the European Council."
"The tool of public markets could help us towards that aim. I deplore the extremely conservative and classical vision of commercial law revealed by you once again in your speech."
"Mr President, I produced the opinion for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at first reading and I would like to raise two specific points that still arise from that opinion."
"The first concerns paragraph 2 of Article 27 in the classical directive and the equivalent text in the utilities directive."
"It is important that we leave out the phrase 'collective agreements declared or deemed to be generally binding'."
"That phrase would create difficulties and legal uncertainty, most particularly in Germany and the Scandinavian Member States."
"I have worked very closely with the European Trade Union Confederation and with the public service unions both at first reading and second reading and I have received - and a number of Members here will have received - a large number of representations from concerned individuals in those countries."
"I hope, via split votes, that we can leave that text out of the finished text at second reading."
"My second concern applies to Article 53 in the classical directive."
"Several amendments will probably be on offer to align this text with that of Article 55(1), in the utilities directive, as it now stands following the adoption of an amendment by Mr Karlsson in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I disagree with what Commissioner Bolkestein said earlier on this point."
"If we align the classical directive with the text of Article 55(1) of the utilities directive, we would be bringing them into line with the emerging jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice."
"Not to do so would be a retrograde step."
"The Commissioner and his services have consistently given far too negative an interpretation of ECJ jurisprudence on this point and that is why we have such clear difficulties emerging in our debate here over applying environmental and social considerations."
"I hope that these considerations can be taken into account tomorrow."
"Mr President, I want to come back to the remarks made by Mr Harbour."
"We want to create innovation."
"Would you agree with me that we will not create innovation by imposing standards on ecological or social issues?"
"This is only the lower level."
"In a market economy there are factors wish push the market and factors which pull the market: the stick and the carrot."
"What we want, when we speak about introducing ecological criteria or fair-trade criteria, is to create a market for innovation in ecology, fair trade and social issues."
"Therefore we need clear criteria on this in the directive."
"That is the only thing we need."
"That is why we are pushing this so much."
"It has enormous leverage - 15% of the European internal product."
"If we are serious about sustainability we have to use this."
"It is not via fierce competition in the private sector that this innovation will come."
"It will be because the public sector takes more responsibility."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, why do we disagree on this point?"
"Because your Europe is a Europe of big multinational companies where there is no ecology, no social rights and where the poor people live in their poor working conditions."
"My Europe is a Europe of citizens."
"I am proud of this."
"If we have to fight over this issue it is because you have a very new, liberal approach to Europe and we do not want that."
"Mr President, I wish to concentrate on that part of the report concerning public procurement where, unfortunately, the untoward situation has arisen in which, even though we issued a sound report at first reading, the quality has, since then, gone seriously downhill, with regard too to the common position we have obtained from the Council."
"I think it is a huge problem when the Council adopts a common position that is not in accordance with current law as laid down by the Court of Justice."
"The fact that the Court lays down something of which the Council takes no account is a major problem, and matters are not made any better by our also having a committee that chooses not to take account of the Court pronouncements we have."
"I believe that we in the EU have a clear obligation to promote our own objectives concerning sustainable development and to comply with our social responsibility. That means that we must also be able to incorporate social and environmental considerations into public procurement."
"I should like to say to some of those on the right wing who, in Parliament today, have accused us of being rabid environmental campaigners, that what is important in this case is that we in actual fact want to make public procurement transparent and to make it possible for social and environmental provisions to be incorporated into such procurement without, of course, disturbing the internal market."
"No one is talking about disturbing the internal market."
"We are all of us concerned that the internal market should operate properly, but we just want to make it possible for those who invite tenders to attach importance to things other than just price, that is to say to a broadly-based labour market, social conditions and the environment."
"It is in actual fact very simple, and fortunately we have a decision on this matter."
"The second thing I have to mention is that, during the first reading, we tabled a number of amendments to Article 27, in actual fact emphasising the aspect of labour market conditions."
"As Mr Hughes said, a curious change has, however, again crept into the amendment whereby it has been made conditional upon the aforementioned agreements being made law in the Member States. It is therefore essential to have that clause removed before we vote on the recommendation for second reading on Wednesday."
"There is no reason for interfering with the collective agreements we have in certain countries, and that is what in actual fact would be happening if the small clause in question were not removed. I recommend to the House here today that it consider adopting Amendment No 40 but that it avoid also accepting this clause."
"I hope we can in that way support the split vote proposed by Mr Hughes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Zappalà, some 10 years ago, I sat on the municipal council in Eindhoven, in the southeast of Brabant, which is a technology region."
"Philips and Daf were in dire straits."
"It was a time of high unemployment as a result of all kinds of developments in international industry."
"In those days, there was a covenant involving industry and the municipality on building in a sustainable manner."
"There was little employment in the building industry."
"Then, we discovered that in Groningen, there was a model for European contracts which was able to meet a number of criteria, for example with regard to equal working conditions and social legislation, but also to the regional labour market's employment criteria and to environmental criteria."
"We found this valuable and subsequently applied it."
"This would, to a large extent, be allowed on the basis of the current proposals."
"However, the problem that is causing anxiety for many is that the Christian Democrats, and particularly the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, have accepted a number of amendments on the basis of which it would no longer be possible to spend public funds in this transparent, non-discriminatory way that serves regional causes."
"We are talking about socially responsible entrepreneurship to ensure that financial, social and environmental objectives are integrated into a strategic policy."
"We should, however, be fighting for socially responsible government even more than for socially responsible entrepreneurship."
"We could then, if we take transparency into account, also avoid the likelihood of fraud."
"In other words, we agree to a number of the objectives that Mr Bolkestein mentioned, such as legal certainty and effective spending, but integral policy means that we should also include a number of other criteria, and that is what, in my view, we should vote for tomorrow."
"Mr President, let me, in my capacity as my group's shadow rapporteur, apologise to you, to the Commissioner, and to all my fellow Members for not having been present at the beginning of the debate."
"Together with Mr Bill Miller, I was trapped on a Strasbourg city bus, the driver of which could not find the way, initially to Frankfurt and then back to Strasbourg, and got us to Strasbourg via many German autobahns and with something of a delay."
"Belatedly, but not too late, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the great deal of work he has done and, in particular, for resisting his first temptation, that of giving in to quite understandable disappointment that the Council has taken up so little of what Parliament has proposed and therefore going all out for a rejection of the Common Position."
"This was something we discussed in the committee, where a majority of us took the view that - even if it proved a wearisome exercise - we should attempt to make improvements to the Common Position."
"The fact is, of course, that the debate about rejection of this Common Position is far from over."
"I do not know if, perhaps, another amendment has been tabled this evening with this in mind; that there is a great temptation to do so has to do with the fact that, whilst the Council took on board quite a bit of what Parliament had proposed, this tended to be harmless technical points, whilst the major issues of substance were utterly ignored."
"What still counts from my point of view is that, in both draft directives, I can see substantial improvements over against the current legal position, and certainly as regards modernisation, simplification, the introduction of electronic tendering procedures or the use of electronic media in the tendering process, and the ways in which things are made easier for specific sectors."
"For example, I am very glad that this Parliament's initiative has succeeded in getting postal services included in the utilities directive."
"If though, on the one hand, we can speak in terms of progress, we should beware, at the same time, of ending up going backwards."
"There has already been much debate about the award criteria, and I would like to again shed light on something that is obviously not yet clear, namely that the text now provided in the Common Position represents a retrograde step vis-à-vis the current legal position and removes the legal basis on which the Court of Auditors could make very favourable judgments."
"The result is that these award criteria will be more restrictive in future."
"Being more restrictive in this area does not mean merely that I do not want options - of an ecological nature, for example - that are currently available to me; my concern is, rather, with the issue of democracy."
"Local authorities are among the most important bodies in Europe as a whole when it comes to awarding contracts."
"Mr Bouwman mentioned an example from the one where he lives."
"As institutions, local authorities enjoy direct democratic legitimacy, and if, for example, they come to realise that - even if it comes rather more expensive - they want wooden window frames produced by sustainable forestry, then let them in future be able to have them."
"They are responsible to their own citizens and to their auditors, and nowadays they do not exactly have much money sloshing around."
"That is also my objection to what Mr Karas said."
"If we are struggling to make improvements, our primary concern here is with restoring the current legal position rather than with going back to what preceded it; secondly, this is not about mandatory criteria along the lines of every contract-awarding body having to apply every conceivable criterion; rather, it is about them being able to do so if that is what they would like to do and if they are transparent in the way they do it."
"As it is at present framed, the obligatory part can have only one meaning, that these options are restricted."
"Although the recitals reintroduce the possibility of a number of things, I find that rather unpleasing from the point of view of legal policy, and I do not think it does much for legal certainty either."
"As reference has been made in this debate to the inconsistencies that remain, there is an offer I would like to renew."
"Perhaps we could, by aligning our voting lists tomorrow, recover something of what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market produced?"
"I can also announce that we will no longer be supporting all the amendments that we supported in the Committee on Legal Affairs; this will enable us to take with us rather fewer amendments into the conciliation procedure that now appears, unfortunately, to be unavoidable."
"Mr President, it is important that we have transparent, workable directives."
"It is important to give a clear lead to our local authorities or to our public - in some cases private - utilities."
"Above all, it is important that we give a clear lead to the workforces operating within those contracting authorities."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market unfortunately did not provide that transparent, workable directive."
"What we have is two directives, which are not in line with each other."
"In fact, in certain areas, they are actually contradictory."
"The Legal Affairs Committee missed an opportunity to advance the social provisions to workers."
"It has advanced - to give it credit - the case of workers with disabilities."
"But we could have gone further."
"That is why I am reintroducing my Amendment No 166, which was adopted at first reading by a large majority."
"Now certain groups seem to have gone cold on it."
"Amendment No 166 to Article 53(1) and (2) reintroduces the flexibility contracting authorities require when deciding on awarding contracts, not just being bound by the lowest price."
"It should be made clear to all those companies that intend to tender for these contracts that they have to introduce social and environmental conditions for their own workforces or they will not get the contracts."
". Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor a second time on this important matter."
"I would like to reply to some of the points raised."
"I would like to elucidate what I said earlier so that no misunderstandings remain between what this Parliament would like to see the Commission do, and what the Commission itself intends to do."
"Firstly I refer to what Mr MacCormick said right at the beginning of this debate, which was also repeated by other speakers."
"Mr MacCormick referred to the current state of jurisprudence."
"In accordance with that jurisprudence, the common position already clarifies that environmental characteristics and social clauses may be used as award criteria and that it is not necessary that each and every award criterion taken individually can be shown to provide an economic benefit for the contracting authorities or entities."
"It is sufficient that taken as a whole the award criteria can carry out their proper function, which is to allow an objective evaluation and comparison of the intrinsic qualities of the products or services offered and by the award of the contract to the most economically advantageous tender."
"Here I would also refer to Mr Harbour's remarks, with which the Commission agrees."
"Secondly, Mrs Thors and Mr Junker referred to production methods."
"I should like to reply that regarding the amendments which aimed to insert explicit references to production methods, the Commission is of the opinion that it is superfluous to do so since production methods are a part of the environmental characteristics which, as I have just said, are already allowed for."
"Furthermore, they are explicitly referred to as examples of legitimate technical specifications."
"I then come to my third point, which was also raised by Mr MacCormick."
"In Article 53 the words 'for the contracting authority' are explained by recital 44 as meaning that the best tender will be assessed according to what the contracting authority will have defined as its requirements."
"Recital 44 further clarifies that this encompasses requirements addressed to satisfy the needs of the public concern in the case of the ruling about the need to limit air pollution for the population of the City of Helsinki."
"Mr Koukiadis gave us a further example of valid award criteria under Article 53 - the needs of handicapped people, which should be taken into account."
"In the case of transport services - for example better access to buses for handicapped people - would certainly be a valid criterion."
"There is no doubt about that."
"My fifth point refers to the phrase 'economically most advantageous', which Mr Herman Schmid and a number of speakers mentioned."
"In reply to those comments, the most economically advantageous tender would be the result of a combination of economic but also qualitative criteria, and the latter would serve not necessarily to calculate the costs for the contracting authority, but would certainly help that contracting authority to make up its mind."
"My penultimate point refers to labels, which Mr Jonckheer mentioned."
"As the common positions clearly show, the Commission is in favour of clarifying the role of eco-labels in public procurement and the possibility of referring to them when defining technical specifications."
"It should be kept in mind, however, that unlike 'ordinary' European standards, European eco-labels do not replace other competing eco-labels such as pluri-national ones."
"The Commission's proposals on eco-labels had foreseen such replacement, but this was not accepted during the legislative process."
"The current situation is, therefore, that different eco-labels may exist side by side even if they cover the same aspects."
"It would therefore not be appropriate - indeed, it would be contrary to established policy in the environmental field - to introduce a preference for European eco-labels over other eco-labels."
"The Commission is conscious that references to the performances underlying eco-labels rather than to simply require the labels themselves may be more complicated for purchasers."
"This task has been rendered easier through a database created by the Commission which lists the different performances defined in eco-labels that can be used in connection with award procedures."
"I can add that a practical guide to green procurement will be published later this year."
"Finally, I should like to deal with the questions put by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and Mr Hughes as to why the Commission is going back on current law as interpreted by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki buses case."
"My answer quite simply is as follows: it is simply not true that the common positions are more restrictive than the interpretation of current law given by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki buses case."
"On the contrary, through the combination of recitals and Articles, the common positions consolidate and clarify the possibilities offered by current law."
"They do not add anything to or subtract anything from current possibilities, but they have the merit of setting these out explicitly instead of having to rely on interpretations of jurisprudence with all the ensuing possibilities for different use and consequent legal uncertainty on this crucial issue."
"Moreover, they clarify that under the same conditions as set out by the Court of Justice, the use of social award criteria is also legitimate."
"I should like to end by expressing the hope that in its vote Parliament will support the common position so that we can get these directives onto the statute book as quickly as possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.34 p.m.)"
"Greek Presidency"
"The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement on the European Council in Thessaloniki on 20-21 June 2003, and a statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the review of the Greek presidency."
"Before I invite the Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, to address the House, I should like to place on the record, on my behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament, our gratitude to the Prime Minister, to the Foreign Minister and his colleagues - in particular to Minister Yiannitsis - for a very high level of cooperation with the European Parliament throughout the Greek semester in seeking together to advance the major dossiers."
"We are also grateful for the assistance which they have offered in a number of areas of interest to Parliament, including the conclusion of our negotiations on an interinstitutional agreement on better regulation and law-making, the party political statute, and their considerable assistance - although we are still short of target - in working with us on the issue of the Members' Statute."
"I am pleased, in that context, to give the floor to Prime Minister Simitis."
"Mr President, Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to present the results of the Greek Presidency from this tribune today."
"Last January, when we held the first debate here on our priorities, I stressed that what we had to strive for was to support a strong Europe, which participates and acts in a multi-centre global system and works for peace, development and cooperation."
"Six months of important events and developments have intervened."
"I believe that, because of these events, Europe has grown up over these six months. Events have allowed it to see its weaknesses, such as the crisis in Iraq, but they have also allowed it to see its strong points."
"Despite the crisis, there has been a feeling of unity, a feeling of cohesion, a feeling of a common mission."
"Events have made it politically more mature and more determined to proceed with new actions and have highlighted the need to meet the challenges relating to its future."
"It is highly illustrative that the Convention completed its work on the draft constitution and that this draft constitution was accepted by the Convention by a large majority."
"It is likewise highly illustrative that the Council of Ministers started a debate on European defence and security, a debate which continued at the summit in Thessaloniki."
"The problems resulted in an awareness of what has to be done and done quickly."
"Greece had the good fortune to assume the Presidency in an exceptionally important six-month period."
"A six-month period, as I said, of unexpected events."
"Events which presented huge difficulties, but which were also a huge challenge, to which I believe we all responded, by which I also mean both the Member States and the Commission as well as the Presidency."
"Today, the debate on foreign policy, defence, security, the global strategic perception of Europe which has come about over these months and the draft Constitutional Treaty, bears witness to the fact that work has now begun, work which will result in a different form of cooperation."
"And it will, I trust, be positive for Europe and it will be work which will give us new momentum."
"We have realised that we must take decisions as quickly as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in December 2002, the Greek Presidency presented its priorities and specific objectives."
"We said then that we had five main priorities."
"First of all, to complete the enlargement of the European Union."
"Secondly, to speed up the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"Thirdly, to complete the work of the Convention on the future of Europe."
"Fourthly, to deal with the phenomenon of illegal immigration and immigration in general and, fifthly, to promote specific priorities in the field of foreign relations."
"I can state today, at the end of these six months, that we worked hard towards these objectives and that we achieved very satisfactory results, which I should like to set out for you briefly."
"The ceremony for the signing of the Accession Treaty by the 10 candidate countries, which set the seal on enlargement, was a ceremony which marked one of the most important events in the development of Europe."
"It confirmed the regeneration of Europe; we celebrated it on the foothills of the Acropolis, our wish being to provide a particular symbolism for the continuation of European civilisation."
"Immediately before that, the Greek Presidency dealt with a series of difficulties that had arisen, such as new requests from the new Member States for existing agreements to be adapted and for new funding and such as the debate we had with you, here in the European Parliament, on issues of enlargement and funding or funding of the enlarged Union."
"Now the new Member States have integrated smoothly into the work of the Council of Ministers, at which they will participate as active observers pending the ratification of the Treaties by the national parliaments."
"I should like to comment on the integration of Cyprus, which joined together with the other nine countries and constitutes the justification of the fight for political restoration, for the restoration of the principles of international law."
"We were very close to having a united Cyprus in the Union, to overcoming the political problem, but unfortunately, the Turkish-Cypriot leadership did not want to complete the procedure started on the basis of the Annan plan."
"In April, the Council adopted revised partnership texts with the three candidate countries."
"As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, the objective is to complete their accession negotiations by the end of 2004."
"We advanced numerous chapters in the negotiations with these countries."
"The new partnership with Turkey includes specific terms on numerous issues, including the good neighbours policy, property belonging to minorities, religious freedom and limiting the role of the army."
"As regards the second issue, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of Lisbon, we know how important the issues described under this title are and that, provided we resolve them, they will help us deal with the problems of development, environmental charges and the creation of a knowledge-based economy."
"The most important results, briefly, are as follows: the agreement on better coordination of financial policies and the adoption of the new economic policy guidelines for the period from 2003 to 2005."
"We shall now have economic policy guidelines for three years and this is, I believe, important so that we can plan better."
"A second point was the new employment strategy."
"We introduced the tripartite social conference which was informal and has now been formalised and which, of course, allows us to broaden the social dialogue."
"There was agreement on tax arrangements in relation to tax evasion to third countries and taxation of energy products."
"The agreement on tax arrangements in relation to tax evasion had been discussed for a very long time in the Council without our coming to any conclusion and I am glad that we managed to overcome the problems under the Greek Presidency, problems which also arose because certain countries felt, and still feel, that they should try to make special arrangements of their own on such basic issues."
"We overcame that."
"Another arrangement which had been discussed for a very long time was the European patent."
"We completed the relevant debate and there was agreement, as there was on the action plan to increase investment in research and incorporate new technologies into European education systems."
"I think that the adoption of the Small Business Charter, the decisions to improve the regulatory framework and the agreements on integrating the European stock exchanges were important."
"The decisions on the liberalisation of the energy market, on the carriage of freight by rail and on the new trans-European energy network and on extending the transport network were the subject of long discussion, but we completed them."
"The adoption of the new strategy for sustainable development, the introduction of environmental objectives in sectors such as renewable sources of energy, decisions to withdraw single hull tankers and the agreement on environmental liability close this brief report."
"I should like here to emphasise that the decision to withdraw single hull tankers, on which all the interested parties cooperated, was an important decision for environmental protection, a decision which in previous efforts years ago, after the accident of the Erika, was not taken."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that brings me to the third subject, the Convention on the Future of Europe."
"At the European Council in Thessaloniki, as you know, the Convention's final proposal was presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"Discussions were held for 18 months in the Convention and your participation was a determining factor."
"The draft Constitutional Treaty emerged with a high degree of support."
"We discussed in Thessaloniki whether this draft is a draft for starting negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference and whether it is a good basis for discussion."
"And we agreed that it is a good basis, which will help to get the negotiations started, because we realised that the terminology should not create confusion with respect to reality."
"The agreement in the Convention shows that the frameworks within which we can change things are frameworks which need to be based on broad acceptance."
"The Convention expressed broad acceptance and that is a basis for us to resolve the problem."
"We must not start discussing everything from square one at the Intergovernmental Conference, nor must we focus on one issue or another and fail to reach a solution which has politically predefined margins, as referred to in the decision taken in Halkidiki."
"We must close the Intergovernmental Conference by 1 May and we must sign after 1 May, so that the new members can sign and the text is ready before the elections on 15 June, so that the European citizens know what they will be voting on."
"This is the timetable - if the matter can be closed earlier so much the better - but the final cut-off date for the presentation of the signed text must be 15 June."
"We also agreed that the Convention will continue for a certain period of time to examine the text in order to process the third chapter, which concerns policies, as the text states, on technical matters."
"In Thessaloniki, ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed immigration policy."
"What was the problem?"
"The problem is that in Seville and Tampere we had a great many decisions and that we could not complete and apply these decisions, the first and main reason being the lack of funds."
"The European Commission stated that it had approximately EUR 140 million at its disposal."
"We noted that this sum was available and we then decided to promote coordination and cooperation on guarding the borders, because it is clear that the problem of illegal immigration, as we saw a few weeks ago in Italy, for example, cannot be dealt with by one country alone, given that illegal immigrants come in, for example, by boat and try to disembark in one Mediterranean country or another and there must be overall monitoring of the area."
"The second point we emphasised was the undertaking to repatriate illegal immigrants."
"We called on the Commission to examine the possibility of new ways of safeguarding repatriation."
"However, because there are already numerous treaties and agreements on repatriation, which essentially do not operate, we said that the Commission would need to evaluate cooperation with third countries on all issues relating both to immigration and cooperation with the European Union on the basis of specific criteria and take this into account when making agreements or policies with these countries, because it is not possible - this is not stated in the text but it is generally accepted - for us to make a policy of active help and cooperation while, at the same time, the countries we trade with are indifferent to the obligations which they have to combat the phenomena of illegal immigration."
"We decided to proceed to create a common information technology system for issuing visas to third country nationals, which will allow illegal immigrants to be controlled, and we took certain decisions on the integration of immigrants into our societies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, following the Thessaloniki Summit, an agreement was reached on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Here again, the Presidency played an important part and we believe that this agreement is particularly useful because it sends out three central messages."
"What does the agreement mean to farmers?"
"It means that they will have a multiannual, guaranteed, predictable framework of income support similar to that which they enjoy today, as well as large margins as regards their production and business options."
"For European citizens, the agreement means a better quality of life, because farmers' income support will depend on compliance with European legislation on the environment, public health, food safety, hygiene and animal welfare."
"Thirdly, shifting a very large part of common agricultural policy subsidies from products to income support to farmers will seriously strengthen the position of the European Union at the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"With this agreement, the Union will speak with one clear voice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as far as foreign relations are concerned, I can report that there was agreement between the Member States of the Union, followed by agreement with the countries of the Western Balkans, confirming the accession prospects of the countries in the region, adopting a new procedure for regular political dialogue and promoting the harmonisation of their legislation with the Community acquis and an important increase in financial support."
"Iraq, as we know, was the most difficult chapter of our Presidency."
"Many people expected it to take up all our time."
"It did not, of course, and what the Presidency aspired to was to overcome the differences, not by discussing if certain people were or were not right to support one position or another, but to overcome the differences by pointing out what would need to be done in the future."
"And following the United Nations Security Council resolution, there is now a framework for cooperation and we are in constant contact with the United Nations so that we can help with the reconstruction of Iraq within the framework of its resolutions."
"As far as the Middle East is concerned, you know that the timetable for peace in the region, the so-called road map of the Quartet, was published and that the European Union is participating in this Quartet."
"The Presidency had repeated contacts with the countries in the area and with the other countries and I believe that the truce achieved is the result both of the actions of the Quartet and of the European Union."
"As far as trans-Atlantic relations are concerned, the Greek Presidency made every possible effort to defuse the tension which had arisen in trans-Atlantic relations and I believe that the visit to Washington demonstrated that we have good cooperation."
"A principle was accepted which I believe to be self-evident; in other words, that we must cooperate for the necessary reasons, for economic, political and security reasons, with the United States."
"We can agree, we can disagree, when we disagree we can agree to disagree and continue our cooperation on this basis."
"The Greek Presidency promoted a substantial improvement in relations between the European Union and Russia at the summit held in St Petersburg."
"Finally, I should like to move from political issues to defence and security policy."
"Our aim was for the European Union to have full operational capability."
"And it acquired it during this period."
"It acquired it by settling outstanding issues, such as the contribution of forces on the part of the partners, the application of the programme of manoeuvres and the development of crisis management procedures."
"As a result, a European Union force is now in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, there is a policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina and we are also discussing the military mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina to take over the current activities of the ???? force there."
"At the European Council in Thessaloniki, the report on the strategy to gradually formulate a European defence and security doctrine was presented and discussed."
"The informal Council of Foreign Ministers had asked for this report from Mr Solana."
"Mr Solana will continue work in connection with this report and we believe that the report and the relevant debate will be an important step towards clarifying our common objectives in relation to defence and security and the means with which we shall achieve the common objectives."
"The report helped to overcome the opposition which had appeared - and which I do not believe really existed - between certain countries cooperating to promote defence and security issues and other countries which did not want any such particular cooperation."
"We are now sitting at the same table and the discussion will show how we can address these issues."
"To close, I should like to refer to two issues relating to Community institutions."
"The first is the review of the status of Community staff."
"This is the first radical reform of the salary and pension system and the career system since the European Community was founded."
"Finally, two issues of immediate interest to the European Parliament were the Interinstitutional Agreement to improve the regulatory environment and, secondly, the regulation on the status of European political parties."
"With these two arrangements, we put an end to discussions which started a long time ago."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this was the brief presentation of what was done during the Presidency and I should like to close by thanking, first of all, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pat Cox, for his cooperation, and all of you in the European Parliament."
"We consider that you are pivotal to promoting European integration and defending the Union's interests, which is why we aspire to close cooperation with you."
"And we had your direct support and cooperation in our work."
"I thank you warmly for your contribution, and I wish you all every success during the forthcoming Italian Presidency."
". (IT) Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the half-way stage of a year full of ambitious projects and intense debate on the nature and destiny of Europe."
"I would like, first of all, to heartily congratulate Prime Minister Simitis and all those who have worked alongside him to achieve our political and institutional goals."
"I should like to focus on four of these goals: the conclusion of the work of the Convention, the Commission reforms, the substantial progress made in implementing the Tampere agenda and the new statute for European political parties."
"Before addressing them in detail, however, I must mention some of the other major events of the last six months: the winding-up of the accession negotiations - a momentous event which Prime Minister Simitis has already discussed - and the handling of the difficult internal and international situations caused by the war in Iraq."
"The reform of our common agricultural policy also deserves a special mention, the agreement last week bringing these six months to a close on a high note."
"One of the essential elements in this success was the opinion issued by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, chaired by Joseph Daul, which I would like to thank heartily for its work."
"Despite the extremely complex and thorny nature of the issue, the committee managed to deliver its opinion in good time for the conclusion of the negotiations."
"This is a real innovation, for the decoupling of Community production subsidies, partial though it is, combined with land-management, environment and food-safety measures, is a genuinely revolutionary step for our agricultural policy."
"We now have a good springboard for entering the WTO negotiations, and I expect our international partners - who are always lecturing us - to match our commitment and do their part too, for they too must do their part."
"In these six months, the Greek Presidency has steered us safely through the most troubled waters with that wisdom and sensitivity that has characterised the Greek people since the dawn of our civilisation."
"As regards the first point I wanted to mention, within the Union, the first half of the year was dominated by the work of the Convention, which was almost - although not completely - finished in time for the Thessaloniki European Council."
"We have found a method that has worked and that we could use to amend the Constitution if ever it needs to be revised in the light of the constant flow of new developments reserved for us in the future."
"As for the actual draft Constitution, there are positive and negative points in the Commission's eyes, as you know."
"It certainly makes the Union more transparent by simplifying and reducing the number of legislative instruments and by proposing a better division of powers between the institutions."
"It strengthens our democratic legitimacy by extending the codecision procedure so that it applies almost across the board, and this is something that is extremely important for Parliament."
"It increases our ability to make our voice heard in the world through a newly created foreign minister for the whole Union, through the establishment of a single legal personality and through new provisions on the foreign, common security policy and defence policy."
"Lastly the text of the Constitution now includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights safeguarding the rights of all European citizens."
"These are the high points, and they are very important high points, but there are also a number of weak points where the compromise brokered does not go as far as we would have liked."
"Although the draft Constitution extends qualified-majority voting, it certainly does not go far enough."
"The proposed solution carries the risk of paralysis in a 25- or 30-Member State Union."
"When it comes to the institutions, moreover, it will be difficult to convince the citizens that only half of the Commissioners should have a vote in the College, at least in such a complex phase in our institutional life as this."
"Furthermore, the potentially overlapping roles of the newly created position of President of the Council and President of the Commission will be just as hard to understand."
"Some advances in economic governance are made but it is imperative that we also set up the external representation of the euro, lack of which leaves the euro, without a doubt, more vulnerable and our economy more exposed."
"These are not just technicalities but issues which require us to muster the courage to overcome the misgivings and fears of the present and look to the future."
"We must realise that, if we do not make the leap today, Europe will no longer have any influence on the international stage in 30 or 40 years' time."
"Viewed as a whole, however, the Convention's draft is a sound basis - and a joint effort which I support - for the Intergovernmental Conference that will have the task of approving a final version."
"The Commission will play its part in making improvements in this regard, starting with the opinion that will be published in September in time for the start of the IGC."
"The second point is the reform of the Commission and the staff regulations."
"We are approaching the last year of the Commission's term of office."
"When I arrived, I made Commission reform one of my priorities, and I remember that we issued a White Paper as early as March 2000."
"A crucial part of this reform was an overhaul of the staff regulations for EU officials."
"Here, too, I must thank the Greek Presidency for driving forward these negotiations, which were, in actual fact, extremely difficult."
"Thanks to these valuable endeavours to mediate and drive forward the process, we reached a consensus on the best possible compromise, a compromise that respects - and I would stress this - the general approach of the Commission's initial proposals."
"As a follow-up to this agreement, the Commission will submit a second proposal in the autumn that will, of course, take account of this House's resolution of 19 June 2003 and the talks between representatives of staff, institutions and the Member States taking place in the consultative committee."
"The aim is to bring the new regulations into force on 1 May 2004, the same day on which the new Member States will become part of the Union."
"In addition to this goal, however, I am interested in the ultimate political aim of the exercise, which is to ensure continuity, independence and quality in our departments."
"I have to say that I have worked with many administrations in my life, and rarely have I encountered such hard-working, high-calibre employees as I have observed in the EU institutions."
"I therefore believe that the new staff regulations will allow our staff to work with renewed energy and pride, especially when their colleagues from 10 new Member States arrive."
"It will not be an easy matter to absorb new cultures, precisely because 10 countries are arriving together, not just one."
"The third point I want to focus on is immigration and asylum policy and the management of the Union's external borders."
"The Commission would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on sustaining a consistent and balanced position on these matters."
"Moreover, I am happy to note that the European Council conclusions were inspired by the Commission's communications of 4 June."
"More specifically, looking at the issues still on the table, I would point out that Community financing should gradually rise to match the scope of our political goals and objectives."
"In other words, on no account can we pretend to be able to achieve all the goals we have set ourselves with the funding we have come up with."
"We have, of course, produced an estimate of resources which does not exceed the limits of the budget - we have remained strictly within the limits of the budget - but we have estimated the resources needed at EUR 140 million for the years 2004 to 2006, and at EUR 250 million for a multiannual cooperation programme with non-Member countries over the period 2004 to 2008."
"This will take us through to the new funding provided under the post-2006 Financial Perspective, which, as the Thessaloniki conclusions confirm, must reflect this political priority of the Union."
"Otherwise, clearly, if we do not succeed in giving the citizens security, we will be jeopardising the very identity of the Union."
"As far as relations with third countries are concerned, the new programme of cooperation proposed by the Commission on 11 June will provide substantial support for the common readmission policy, which is another milestone, and it is crucial that you and the Council approve this proposal before the end of this Parliamentary term."
"Negotiation of Community agreements, with the support of the Council and the Member States, should also be stepped up."
"As I see it, Russia, Ukraine and Morocco, three key countries for these agreements, are the main priorities."
"The European Council has asked the Commission to proceed towards integrated management of external borders, and we believe that the best solution is to set up an agency; this will make it possible to improve implementation of the Council's strategic guidelines, in agreement with the relevant national authorities, in such a way as to constitute a network of coordination."
"We are also laying the foundations for what is known as the VIS, the ambitious European Visa Identification System, which is also a common instrument for implementing a policy which will reassure our citizens and give them peace of mind with due regard for individual freedoms."
"Indeed, the main thing is to strike a balance between security and our commitment to upholding freedoms, a commitment which we have made, which we confirm and which we can on no account go back on."
"Combating illegal immigration must therefore go hand in hand with measures to facilitate the entry of legal migrants into the Union."
"In this connection, let me remind you that we already have some proposals on the table, notably those on admission and residence for purposes of work, study, vocational training of immigrants and voluntary work to facilitate integration."
"Parliament has already delivered an opinion on these proposals, which are still being discussed by the Council."
"The Commission welcomes the European Council's call to draw up an overall policy for integrating legal immigrants."
"We need better coordination of national measures at Community level as well."
"I feel that an annual progress report would certainly be a step in the right direction."
"There has been so much talk about benchmarking, dialogue and so on. I believe that, in such a complex matter where so many different factors are involved, a report taking stock at European level could be useful to both you and us."
"We must show the same political drive in the field of asylum."
"In this regard, I am very disappointed to have to report that the Council was unable to reach agreement on the directive defining the concept of refugee and harmonising subsidiary forms of protection."
"We must achieve this, again within the framework of the debate on rights which we mentioned just now."
"Indeed, this directive, together with the directive on procedures, is at the heart of the common system."
"I want to take this opportunity to promise that the Italian Presidency will have the Commission's full cooperation in getting these two directives adopted by December at the latest, the deadline set by the Thessaloniki European Council."
"I will now come to the last point, the statute for political parties."
"We welcome the recent adoption of the statute for European political parties by this House."
"This is the fourth success of the Greek Presidency that I want to mention today."
"Let me add to the many others my own words of appreciation for your contribution in settling an issue which had become never-ending and which it was imperative to resolve."
"A number of factors have helped us achieve this result: the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, the new proposal drawn up by the Commission, the use of majority voting and, above all, first-rate cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"The issue of political parties was a complex one that had remained unresolved for two years."
"This welcome settlement was achieved only thanks to majority voting and the codecision procedure."
"We must learn from this for the future."
"At last, European political parties have a clear and transparent framework in which to work and can count on a source of financing that will be borne, at least partially, by the Community budget."
"This is an absolute prerequisite for running a democracy and a measure that is part of the broader process of putting European integration on a constitutional footing."
"The proposal adopted lays down some clear and simple conditions but avoids being overly restrictive or too formally bureaucratic, and so I feel it is a sensible measure which will have positive political effects."
"Indeed, as we all know, the political parties are the key element in the Union's democratic structure: without them there can be no integration and no European awareness."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this brings me to the end of what I have to say today."
"As I said at the outset, there are many other issues worthy of mention but I think it is preferable to stop here so that we can focus properly on a few events of the past six months which have been of particular political importance."
"Lastly, I would like to thank Prime Minister Simitis and the entire Greek Presidency team once again."
"In these six months, they have taken some huge steps forward for Europe, and I am not praising and thanking this Presidency out of mere politeness but because they really do deserve it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the PPE part of which is today celebrating its fiftieth birthday, has consistently provided very positive support to the Greek Presidency, in close cooperation with our Greek colleagues under the chairmanship of Antonios Trakatellis, but also with our friends in Greece, Nea Demokratia under the leadership of Konstantinos Karamanlis."
"This is what we promised you in Athens, Prime Minister, and we have kept our word because we know that your success is our shared success."
"The highlight of the Greek Presidency - and you were able to build on the good preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency and also on the European Parliament's decision of 9 April - was unquestionably the signature of the accession treaties on 16 April in the Stoa Attalou."
"When we alighted from the bus - and I should particularly like to thank you for inviting the group chairmen to this event, something that should set a precedent for other ceremonial occasions in the European Union - I had the good fortune to be able to accompany the first freely elected prime minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, down the steps at the side of the Acropolis to the Stoa Attalou, and we talked about the great change in Europe and the desire of the people of Central and Eastern Europe to live in freedom."
"The fact that the end of this process was marked as it were with the signature of the treaties in Athens is something that will never be forgotten, and we are grateful that we now have 162 observers with us from the accession countries."
"Unfortunately, however, your presidency has not just been a presidency of high points. As you mentioned yourself, your presidency has been overshadowed by the war in Iraq."
"I do not wish to look back in anger today either: I prefer to look to the future, and we must learn the lessons from the mistakes that we have made."
"Our first conclusion is that if national positions are to be adopted on an issue of foreign policy or if two or three countries wish to take a stance, then they are obliged first to consult all of their European Union partners and to resolve the issues together."
"We must act together and Europe, the European Union, must not go into these difficult decisions when it is already divided into two, three or four camps. Europeans must act together!"
"The second point concerns the Convention."
"On certain issues, including our foreign and security policy, we must have the courage to decide by majorities, albeit by large, qualified majorities."
"If we keep unanimity we will not be able to reach common positions and this is one of our demands."
"My third point is that clearly partnerships are not easy, particularly when one partner is a superpower."
"But it is precisely if we in Europe want to be on an equal footing with our American friends that this European Security and Defence Policy needs to be formulated in such a way that it does not see America as an opponent, but as a partner, a country together with which we wish to solve problems on this earth."
"You referred quite rightly, Mr President-in-Office, to the difficult issues of asylum and immigration, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, whom I should also like to thank very warmly for his work, mentioned the joint administration of external borders."
"This is an important matter: we need to reach agreements with those countries from which these really pitiful people come, from which they set out in their boats, agreements in which they undertake to secure their borders."
"But I would insist that this is not solely a law enforcement issue, a task for the police."
"It is a problem that needs to be resolved above all in the countries of the Mediterranean and in North Africa, and that is why we need European Union assistance for these countries, and these countries have to reform so that the young people in them have a genuine future and do not put their lives in danger by setting off on their travels."
"We see this problem of immigration not only as a policing problem, but also as a fundamentally human problem and the key is to give people the chance of a future in their home countries."
"A further point is the Convention."
"I should particularly like to thank its President, Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, for his work, but also the two Members in the Convention Praesidium, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo from our group and Klaus Hänsch from the Socialist Group, as well as our group spokesman, Elmar Brok."
"We must now call for this draft constitution to form the basis for the work in the Convention and for the decision to be made in the Convention now on the basis of this draft constitution."
"We very much hope - and I will be saying this again tomorrow to the future President of the Council - that we can reach a result by the end of this year, so that swift and speedy progress can be made, and we also hope that the European Parliament will enjoy appropriate and effective representation."
"When the Heads of State and Government meet, the President of Parliament must be present; when the foreign ministers act, our parliamentary representatives should be there and not be as it were consigned to the level of administrators."
"The task before us is immense, but I believe that we can achieve it."
"I should like to thank you in particular, Mr President-in-Office, for your contribution to the Statute for European political parties."
"Admittedly this still needs to be formally adopted under the Italian Presidency, but the approach adopted was, I believe, the right one. As far as the Members' Statute is concerned, I hope that it will be possible here too to make further progress in the next few weeks and months."
"Finally, may I say that this presidency has had its highs and lows: I did not envy your position as President during the Iraq crisis and all that went with it."
"Our group has provided you with fair, objective and positive support; I hope that you share this impression, because this is our shared Europe and a success for Europe is a success for us all."
"Mr President, Mr President?in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to congratulate the Group of the European People's Party on their fiftieth anniversary."
"It is an important date for the PPE-DE and also for democracy in Europe."
"Mr President, I have a problem."
"It is difficult for me at this point to say anything more positive about the Greek Presidency than Mr Poettering and the Financial Times because my family ties and solidarity with the Greek Prime Minister are well known."
"I just want to say one thing, your Presidency has not been a cruise around the Aegean Sea, but rather an 'Odyssey'."
"I believe it is fair to say, moreover, that you have captained the European ship with leadership and decisiveness, and I believe this should be stressed at this point."
"In line with the thinking of the Presidency, firstly, with regard to enlargement, the ceremony of 16 April in the Stoa, in the Market Square next to the Acropolis, was an important event."
"I would like to thank you for the way you treated the representatives of the European Parliament, headed by our President, but above all I would like to thank you for the historic opportunity which took place in what was the cradle of democracy and also, in relation to an issue which is very close to the hearts of all Europeans and very dramatic for Greece - the case of Cyprus and relations with Turkey - the intelligence and flexibility being shown by the current Greek Government in establishing and developing relations with such an important ally."
"Secondly, with regard to the Lisbon strategy, I believe we must stress the implementation of the employment guidelines, particularly with regard to gender equality - and in this regard I would like to welcome the work being done by Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"In the current situation we are largely concerned by the deadlock affecting the directive on temporary workers, as well as the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines are not responding to reality: they are more of an intellectual exercise than a political one, and they do not in fact respond to our need to make our European economy more dynamic and defend our common currency."
"I believe we should also stress, as the President has done, the progress that has been made on maritime safety, particularly in view of Greece's role as the main European power."
"Furthermore, with regard to an aspect which is important to our economic future; the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I believe we should also welcome the fact that we have achieved a reform which puts us in a very significant position in terms of the future, particularly for European agriculture and also for the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"With regard to the future of Europe, the fact that the Convention has concluded its work during the six-month period is an important step, producing a text which does not contain options, which does not contain red cards, and which, as the President has said, and I take good note of this, only needs to be subjected to technical modifications."
"Of course, we would have liked a constitution with more qualified majority voting in social areas, on taxation, on foreign and security policy and with a better interinstitutional balance."
"The best is the enemy of the good, however."
"We believe that the important thing now is to consolidate what has been achieved and not to move backwards."
"In this regard we are also concerned about the participation of Parliament. We believe that the President must be represented at the highest level, that we must have representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference and, furthermore, now that the future of Europe has been debated for the first time in public, in our Parliament as well, in plenary and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, this House must be the public forum which the Presidency is obliged to report to."
"I believe that this also corresponds to the times we are living in."
"I would like to add one further point on the Statute for Political Parties."
"All the parties and parliamentary groups have worked together to achieve a statute for the parties."
"Now, however, we are in the dramatic situation of having a statute for parties but no statute for Members of Parliament. This is like having rules for an army but not having rights for soldiers."
"I would genuinely like, therefore, to draw the attention of the Council Presidency to the fact that it makes no sense to block such an important step, which is of constitutional value to Europe."
"Finally, a comment on external relations."
"You have faced a dramatic crisis which tested the reciprocal loyalty laid down in the Treaties between European allies."
"You acted firmly with regard to transatlantic relations; you maintained European representation in a dignified manner at the summit with a very important ally with which we can have relations without agreeing on everything."
"I believe, therefore, that the Greek Presidency deserves our recognition and our applause."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, looking at the balance sheet of the Greek Presidency, the items on the plus side of the ledger well outnumber those on the negative side."
"Given Europe's difficulties in the last six months with the Iraq war and economic stagnation, that is a remarkable tribute to your government."
"Your first priority, rightly, was to meet the timetable for enlargement of the European Union."
"The signing of the Accession Treaties beneath the Acropolis and seven successful referenda have amply met this goal."
"Our joy at Europe's reunification is nonetheless tinged with sadness that Greece was unable to exploit its privileged relationships to bring in a united Cyprus."
"Please do not cease your efforts."
"We also regret the tensions which surfaced between 'new' and 'old' Europe over Iraq, despite your best efforts and two common positions to your credit."
"Bringing the Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty safely into port also deserves to be chalked up as a notable success of your presidency."
"The Liberal Democrats in this House agree with you."
"The draft text agreed by the Convention provides a good basis for the Constitution, and we will hold Member State governments to the commitments they have made."
"We welcome the extra time given to the Convention to complete its work on Part III, though for the Council to describe the remaining discussions on majority voting and codecision as 'purely technical work' is a masterpiece of understatement worthy of the British Government's description of the whole process as just a 'tidying-up exercise'."
"The vanity of victory teaches us far less than the humiliation of defeat and Europe's failure over Iraq seems to have had some beneficial consequences, notably in driving forward European cooperation in security and defence policy."
"The establishment of the rapid reaction force, the launching of operations in Bosnia, FYROM and the Congo are certainly pluses."
"However, the weaknesses in the quality and coordination of European defence spending are clearly negatives, which we hope will be remedied by the new Armaments Agency."
"Our failure over Iraq also helped you adopt two remarkable documents at Thessaloniki: Mr Solana's EU security strategy and the Council's declaration on weapons of mass destruction."
"The security strategy provides a fitting European response to the US doctrine, resting as it does on the European principles of multilateralism and prevention rather than pre-emption."
"The statement on WMD makes clear to our American friends that we are taking the threat of these weapons seriously, and offers a framework for Europe's response to Iran and North Korea."
"You made Justice and Home Affairs the centrepiece of your presidency programme."
"Much has been achieved, though justice and freedom still play second fiddle to security, to the European Union's discredit."
"Commitments to further progress on legal migration and the integration of third country nationals are a fitting riposte to those who sought to repeat in Thessaloniki the kind of headlines which shamed Seville."
"However, my group regrets that you did not provide for proper parliamentary scrutiny, at European or national level, of the recent EU-US extradition agreement."
"On economic reform the Hellenic Presidency has made good progress, notably reforming the Stability Pact to target underlying deficits, concluding the energy liberalisation package and adopting the much-needed pensions directive."
"All in all, this has been a profitable six months for the European Union, despite the huge costs of war and the difficult economic position."
"Let us hope that, as you hand the baton to your successors, they too will run hard to keep up the Olympian lead that you have established."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in my speech I shall concentrate on a subject which was dealt with at the European Council in Thessaloniki, a subject that has hardly been mentioned up to now, but which is one of considerable scope."
"I too would like to talk about the document presented by Mr Javier Solana entitled 'A Secure Europe in a Better World'."
"On several occasions I have called in vain for a response from the European Union to the publication, on 20 September last year, of the new strategic doctrine of the United States, which was first applied in practice in the 'pre-emptive' war against Iraq."
"Nine months after Washington, therefore, the Council has just given birth to its own strategic doctrine."
"No doubt it is purely by chance that this text first saw the light on the eve of the Transatlantic Summit."
"What, then, does this document say?"
"Let me give you a few quotations. 'With the new threats the first line of defence will often be abroad."
"The new threats are dynamic."
"Left alone, they will become more dangerous'."
"This quotation explains the meaning of that other enigmatic phrase contained in the document, 'Pre-emptive engagement can avoid more serious problems in the future. ?. we should be ready to act before a crisis occurs'."
"Then, just in case things are still not clear, I quote again: 'In failed states, military instruments may be needed to restore order ?' and, more generally, and still quoting, 'We need to develop a strategic culture that fosters early, rapid, and where necessary, robust intervention'."
"Finally, there is the inevitable, 'Acting together, the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world'."
"We cannot believe our ears when we hear such mimicry of the ideas and even the language of the current tenant of the White House."
"If we can believe the press agencies, even Mr Prodi, in the crowd, showed his enthusiasm for President Bush by declaring that when Europe and the United States were united, no enemy would be able to stand up to them."
"On what basis, however, are we to be united, and for what purpose? That is the question, Mr Prodi!"
"It is not by complaisance that we shall earn the respect of an American administration which despises Europeans, including the most conciliatory among them."
"Of that, for my part, I am convinced."
"Europe will exist as an essential actor on the world stage when it has the political will to use its economic clout, its political influence and its capacity for forming strong partnerships, particularly with the South, in order to help to create rules that are different from those that prevail at present, so as to achieve a globalisation with greater solidarity and greater democracy, and so as to create a peaceful world."
"The document presented in Thessaloniki turns its back on such a prospect and gives us an apocalyptic description of the threats, without ever examining their causes in any depth."
"The conflict in the Middle East is dealt with in four and a half lines out of a total of fifteen pages of text."
"The concept of fighting for security that is described therein gives precedence to the military dimension, even though this approach has proved ineffective from Kabul to Baghdad, and even in the United States itself, whose vulnerability was so tragically emphasised on 11 September 2001, despite the fact that that country alone accounts for 40% of the world's military spending."
"In this context, the references in the Council document to the multilateral system have a hollow ring to them."
"After all, the main issues here have to do with the WTO, the international financial institutions and NATO."
"The United Nations is mentioned only in order to ask that in future the European Union should be ready, and I quote, '? to act when their rules are broken'."
"We can recognise, in this allusion, a call to order addressed to those member countries of the Security Council who opposed the 'material breach' argument quoted by George Bush as grounds for going to war with the backing of the UN."
"For all these reasons, my group believes that the taking of this first step towards a new strategic doctrine of the European Union would be a turning point, the implications of which we would have to explain, and the dangers of which we would have to emphasise, to our fellow citizens."
"Given the power of the recent mobilisation of European public opinion, in both East and West, against the argument in favour of war and American supremacy, you can be certain that you will have to explain yourselves."
"I would ask those Members who are motivated by the knowledge that it is civilisation that is at stake here, to join, at 3 p.m. today, in hearing the views, on this subject, of two eminent experts, one, Mr Pascal Boniface, from Europe, and the other, Mr Philip Golub, from America."
"Let us debate the issues with frankness, for it is the whole significance of the Europe of the future that is at stake."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek Presidency fell at a difficult time, and it has been a success."
"I should like to congratulate you on this achievement, Mr President-in-Office."
"Incidentally, you have proved that the principle of a six-monthly rotating presidency of the European Council is a creative and enriching force, and this is something that the future permanent Council presidency will have to prove."
"The Chalkidiki Summit was also a success."
"This was not a foregone conclusion."
"The Heads of State or Government came together and nearly all of them had a long list of national ambitions that, even at the last minute, they wanted to salvage from the Convention's draft constitution."
"But when our Heads of State or Government saw each other they were deeply moved and left the Convention's draft in peace."
"This was a great success, except for the moment when it was decided to regard the Laeken mandate as fulfilled and to inform us - and I should now like to address this point, Mr President-in-Office - that Part III now only required some purely technical work."
"This was the first that we had heard of this: otherwise, why on earth are we continuing our work in the Convention in July?"
"Because there was no consensus on the Praesidium's draft."
"Hundreds upon hundreds of amendments - 1 700 of them - have been tabled and not on technical issues."
"Essentially a very clear question is at stake in this work: namely whether we are going to deliver on the promises, values and aims set out in the first and second parts, whether we are actually going to make the competences, responsibilities and principles of democracy, that we enshrined by consensus in the first and second parts, a reality, or whether we are simply setting ourselves new objectives without freeing Europe from the chains of the past."
"I should like to illustrate how critical this situation is with the aid of a few examples."
"In the first part, of course, we declare our overarching support for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, but in the third part there are still key areas where only the Council can legislate, for example on European social policy."
"National parliaments lose the right to ratify international treaties without this House gaining that right."
"In one of the most difficult cases, concerning the reduced powers of the European Court of Justice to supervise one of the most sensitive areas in the constitution, that of police and judicial cooperation on home affairs, 80% of the Convention have demanded the deletion of the exemptions."
"No policy without judicial control, no law without Parliament - these are clearly not technical issues, but issues of self-determination and the definition of Europe."
"The ability to act is a key principle, but in the last few nights of the Convention whole swathes of policy disappeared from the majority voting list and reappeared under unanimity."
"We were put under pressure by governments. The majority of the Convention wants more; the people of Europe want more."
"We know that the European public demand far more of Europe than the governments of Europe are willing to give."
"The Convention does not need to make technical decisions here; it needs to achieve fundamental reforms."
"Take public services of general interest, cornerstones of European social policy; the vast majority of the Convention want them to be explicitly protected in the constitution."
"So far this request has been turned down."
"I am not saying this to belittle the work of the Convention or the current draft, but to make this House aware that a great deal of what we have enshrined in the first and second parts still needs to be delivered and that we will not be keeping our promises to the people if we do not make one further effort to bring about a genuine reform in the third part."
"Mr President, the Greek Government assumed presidency of the Union at a time of great international uncertainty and political instability."
"It was clear that at the start of this year different governments in Europe had diverse viewpoints when it came to facing up to the growing political problem of Iraq."
"The Greek Government sought to put in place in Europe a common political position on Iraq."
"This was always going to be difficult to achieve but the Greek Government approached this political issue at all times with determination and with true sensitivity to all the parties involved."
"The international difficulties which surrounded the war in Iraq were many, but I believe that in the context of its presidency of the European Union the Greek Government dealt with this difficult political matter as even-handedly as possible."
"The last six months have also seen a great momentum in the work of the European Union Convention."
"The Greek Government has worked very closely with all the representatives on the EU Convention and this has contributed in ensuring a new draft Treaty that will pave the way for new structures within the Union."
"The Treaty forms the basis for future discussions at the IGC, which will finalise the provisions of a new European Treaty."
"We are all aware that the internal structures operating within the European Union must be modernised and by 1 May next we are hopefully going to be living in a Community of 25 Member States comprising a population of over 500 million people."
"Decision-making procedures must change so that we can guarantee that decisions can be taken within the different EU institutions in a streamlined and structured manner."
"We want to enact a new Treaty that will command the support of the people of Europe and which will oversee the smooth running of the European Union for the next 50 years."
"We must recall that the European Union has been a success because the interests and concerns of both the smaller and the larger Member States are respected within the institutional structure in Europe."
"In fact, the last six months have been testament to the fact that the smaller countries in Europe can run an effective and focused presidency of the European Union."
"This is an issue that we will return to again in the run-up to the next IGC."
"The Greek Government has supported recent peace efforts in the Middle East."
"After the war in Iraq the Middle East region has become more unstable and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that we get the peace process in the Middle East back on track."
"This is a matter that should not be left to the United States alone; the European Union has a very positive and central role to play in promoting the road map to peace in the Middle East."
"I would like to commend the Greek Government for the manner in which it has overseen the running of the presidency of the European Union for the past six months."
"The vast majority of the political goals that it set at the start of the year have been met and that is a commendable achievement."
"The Greek Presidency has set a good example of how a presidency should be conducted on behalf of all the Member States and others will do well to follow this example."
"To the President-in-Office I would like to say that you have won respect and support from this institution for the semester."
"On a personal basis I would like to wish him some short period of relaxation in one of the many beautiful Greek islands which some of us had a opportunity of visiting in recent times, during the presidency."
"Might I suggest to President Simitis that I could recommend no place better than Platy Yialos and he would know what I mean when I say that."
"Mr President, the climax of the Greek Presidency was a special summit involving the new nations of the West Balkans."
"They too are making efforts to enter the EU. They will be sincerely welcome, and I am pleased that the EU Charter of Human Rights contains the recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities that is deserved by everyone in the Balkans."
"The EU may have 25 Member States on 1 May of next year, and perhaps 30 in 2007 and 35 in 2010."
"The process may suddenly go very fast, because the countries concerned find it difficult to see any alternatives, given that, in practice, the EU also legislates for its neighbouring countries."
"We must reform the EU that much more quickly in order to obtain more supple and flexible decision-making structures suited to Europe in its entirety, with very big differences between countries."
"An Estonian language teacher can earn ten times as much by working in Brussels."
"It is not easy to secure a proper language education in Tallinn."
"It will be possible for MEPs from Prague to earn 20 times as much as their colleagues in the national parliament, so it will be no fun returning over the Charles Bridge in Prague."
"One hectare of land in the Netherlands costs 30 times as much as Polish agricultural land."
"It is scarcely Polish farmers who are buying up Dutch land."
"The majority of Polish slaughterhouses and dairies are to be closed down when the EU rules come into force."
"Why not be more flexible in introducing EU rules into the candidate countries and the new partnership countries."
"There is no one in the EU who is lining up to pay subsidies to unemployed slaughterhouse workers in Poland."
"The high point of the Greek Presidency was the solemn signature of the agreements to extend the EU to include ten new Member States."
"Here we were in the cradle of democracy, welcoming a range of countries that could only enter the EU because they had become democracies."
"It is one of the Copenhagen criteria that countries can only be accepted when they have stable parliamentary democracies."
"That is why it is all the more absurd that the concluding summit in Haldidiki accepted the Convention's draft constitution that would remove the greater part of democracy in both the new and the present Member States."
"In our case, power is not to reside with those who are elected but with people who were once elected and can now no longer be."
"When prime ministers can no longer be re-elected in their own countries, they can be appointed to lead us in Europe, without being answerable to the electorate."
"The national parliaments and the electorate are losing far more power than the EU is gaining, and that is not a guarantee of increased voter turn-out in the EU elections."
"Hold referendums on the constitution in all the countries. Ask the voters if they want to participate less in elections."
"Imagine its being possible, in the birthplace of democracy, to accept Mr Giscard d'Estaing's getting away with quoting Thucydides, when what the draft constitution does is precisely to remove power from the majority of the electorate in the Member States and give most of it to the bureaucrats in Brussels."
"Mr President, the Athens Accession Treaty signed on 16 April was a historic landmark in the history of Europe."
"Since the fall of the Berlin Wall my party has been consistent and determined in its support for the enlargement of the Union, and we unreservedly welcome the positive results of the referendums that have already taken place in many of the accession states."
"However, we are less supportive of the presidency in other respects."
"On Iraq, the damage to transatlantic relations arising from the 'gang of four' summit, attended by Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg, also severely undermined NATO."
"At a time when many of our citizens in Europe are facing economic stagnation and deflation, there has sadly been little progress in advancing the Lisbon agenda of economic structural reform."
"Instead, we have seen that we again prefer to devote most of our time to institutional reform, whilst persuading ourselves that this is the sort of progress that European citizens are crying out for."
"I doubt it."
"The presidency conclusions begin by stating that the Convention was successful in bringing our Union closer to its citizens, strengthening our Union's democratic character, enhancing our Union's ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system."
"I fear that such warm, optimistic rhetoric is little more than that."
"The results of the Convention's work have again shown the inability of a European political elite to reflect the real concerns of the people of Europe."
"We are asked to believe that what our citizens really want is an EU with a legal personality, a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, the removal of the pillar structure, an extension of majority voting, an EU president and foreign minister, common asylum and immigration policies and a European public prosecutor - in short, that people want a fundamental change in the relationship between the Union and its people."
"The British Prime Minister's now infamous view that the Convention is merely a tidying-up exercise has attracted derision from Eurosceptic and Europhile alike."
"I repeat today that the people of the United Kingdom have a right to a referendum on this constitutional treaty, just as other Member States intend to do."
"If the governments of the Union really wish to bring their citizens closer to the Union, then it is in their interests and those of their people to ensure that referendums are held in order to legitimise what is being proposed in their name."
"My party believes in a different kind of Europe: a Europe where the nation state is the fundamental building block of cooperation and intergovernmentalism is preferable to one-way integration, which I fear is being reinforced by the Convention."
"It is a different kind of Europe to the integrationist agenda, but it is no less European for that."
"I wish the Convention had chosen this route."
"I hope that the governments of the Union look afresh at the results of the Convention when the Intergovernmental Conference begins its work."
"Finally, I noted that the presidency adds that the accession countries will participate in the Intergovernmental Conference on an equal footing with current Member States."
"I hope that means that they will be given the same voting rights as Member States."
"It would be outrageous for the IGC to conclude a new constitutional structure for Europe just weeks in advance of accession and try to present this as a done deal."
"No democrat should put up with that."
"Just for your information, the conclusions from Thessaloniki make it very clear that the accession states will play a full part in the Intergovernmental Conference on an equal footing, which, as you said, is ideal."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the chairman of the socialist group of the European Parliament spoke just now about the Odyssey of the Greek Presidency."
"It was indeed an Odyssey which floated between the Circe of the war in Iraq - perhaps I should remind you that Circe was a wicked witch who had the ability to turn men into pigs - and the good goddess Calypso of the Convention on the Future of Europe which may guide the European Ulysses to the safe haven of the Europe of his dreams."
"As Europeans and as Greeks, we can be proud of this success, however unhappy we are about the incidents of war we had to address."
"The Greek Presidency undertook to address both the issue of Iraq and the differences which this war provoked between the Member States of the European Union and between the European Union and the United States."
"At the summit Councils in February and March, with the promotion and exploitation of the role of the United Nations, the European Union acquired a material presence on the international stage."
"Public opinion in the European countries recognised and welcomed the contribution by the Community institutions."
"The European Union is based not only on the principles of democracy, but also on the rejection in principle of war in international relations."
"The Member States, who have a very bloody history of conflict between them, no longer arm themselves against each other."
"These principles now need to be consolidated between the Member States, the candidate countries and Europe and its new neighbours as a whole."
"The Greek Presidency was persistent in its efforts to disseminate these principles in the new and sometimes dangerous areas of responsibility into which enlargement has led Europe."
"Problems in sensitive areas, such as Cyprus, which the Foreign Ministers in the area have called a sort of powder magazine of the Eastern Mediterranean, were addressed methodically and consistently."
"Cyprus, if there is the cooperation expected from the Turkish side which, unfortunately, there has still not been but we hope that there will be, can constitute a standard for the coexistence of different nations within the same state."
"In the same spirit, the Greek Presidency especially promoted the peace process in the Middle East."
"The current diplomatic procedures in this region are also the result of initiatives by the Greek Presidency."
"From a wider perspective, it is worth highlighting the guidelines given for the formulation of a new strategy by the European Union, which was worked out down to the last detail by the Council's High Representative."
"The promotion of European pacifist positions in the Western Balkans and the summit in Thessaloniki resulted, with its decisions, in a significant turn round in relations between Europe and the Western Balkans."
"With these efforts the world did not become completely safe, but we can say that, thanks to these efforts, the Greek Presidency has bequeathed a much easier or, at least, less difficult task to its successor than it would have had without the methodical, consistent and sometimes inspired work of the Greek Presidency not intervened."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to pay tribute to Mr Katiforis for his work for the Greek Presidency within the Convention."
"The European Council was quite right to resist the temptation to deconstruct the Convention's work."
"The result would certainly be greatly inferior."
"As far as the revision of Part III is concerned, I am prepared to turn myself into a technician, pure or not, for the final phase of the work."
"I quite agree with President Prodi that it is vital to extend the scope of qualified-majority voting as far as we can if the Council is in the future to be able to enjoy the capacity to take decisions."
"But what about Part IV concerning the revision and the entry-into-force procedures?"
"The European Council was completely silent upon this point."
"Was it brought up and, if so, what was said?"
"Would Mr Simitis agree with me that unless we can modify the future revision procedures we will be forever trapped in the dual lock of unanimity plus national ratification procedures - frequently protracted and problematical?"
"Surely it is desirable that the Union avoids putting itself inside such a straitjacket."
"We must find a sufficiently flexible form of modifying the Constitutional settlement if we are to be able to move with the changing circumstances we will face in the years to come."
"Mr President, unfortunately, as we predicted at the beginning of the Greek Presidency, decisions were taken during the past six months of the Greek Presidency which reinforce the anti-grass roots, reactionary and aggressive character of the European Union."
"The increase in the retirement age, the reduction in pensions, the privatisation of social security and the extension of part-time and temporary employment were promoted."
"In the name of competitiveness, the general economic policy guidelines of the European Union were approved, the main feature of which is the attack on the workers in order to increase the profits of the monopolies."
"The citizens of the Member States of the European Union were handed over to the United States bound hand and foot with the disgraceful agreements on judicial cooperation."
"The Greek Presidency aligned with the USA in its interventions in Cuba, with the pretext of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, which proved to be non-existent, and the objective of oil, in order to impose the global sovereignty of the USA."
"During the Greek Presidency, the European Union, despite the unprecedented protests of its peoples, found excuses for and ultimately legalised the savage attack by Anglo-American troops and the occupation of Iraq, with its well documented disastrous results for the Iraqi people. ."
"Fortunately, the occupation is being resisted by the Iraqi people."
"Who the Greek Presidency was serving is clear from the warm congratulations of Messrs Bush and Powell, but also from the outcry by the peoples."
"On the pretext of crushing terrorism, further militarisation of the European Union was promoted, by completing the formation of the European army for imperialist interventions all over the world jointly with ???? and the USA, as was the more general strengthening of the repressive mechanisms to armour the interests of big business inside and outside the European Union from hostile peoples."
"The idea of increasing military spending so that we are reliable partners of the American imperialists with whom, it is said, we are united by common values, also advanced."
"The mid-term review of the CAP was approved, reducing and uncoupling subsidies from production, with disastrous consequences for small and medium-sized farmers, quality and the environment."
"The strengthening of fortress Europe was promoted with new expulsions of immigrants and stricter terms of asylum."
"The signature of the enlargement of the European Union marks new hardships for its peoples and legalises the division of Cyprus as a result of the invasion and occupation by the army of Turkey, which is a candidate for accession."
"Finally, during the Greek Presidency an abortive text was approved, the creation of an anti-democratic Convention, which strengthens the pro-monopoly, anti-working class character of the European Union, the power of the strong and the militarisation of the European Union, in order to claim a more active role within the frameworks of international imperialism at the side of the USA."
"Mr Simitis and his friends are proud of all this."
"We are angry and we are extending our fight with the peoples against these policies."
"Each of us shall serve his cause."
"Mr President, as a member of the Convention I noticed that very early on it became a commonplace - at least certain governments tried to make it so - that the six-monthly rotation of the presidency of the Council leads to inefficiency, a loss of momentum, a loss of direction and, sotto voce, that if too many small countries have the presidency it will not work."
"I congratulate the Greek Presidency most sincerely for having shown that this is completely false."
"It has been the case during the last five years that the small-country presidencies have proved to be models of how this system can work."
"We should take pride and pleasure in that and congratulate the Greek Presidency on it."
"Last Friday, at a meeting in London, a document produced by the London Office of the European Parliament remarked that the Convention was proposing that the Council should have a permanent, powerful presidency."
"Anybody who believes that ought to have a look at the draft text."
"The presidency of the Council will have no constitutional powers."
"The Council is denied any power of legislating."
"The Council may - and ought to - have influence, but the idea that the presidency will be 'powerful' is a great mistake."
"Since it will be a presidency chairing a meeting of prime ministers and heads of states, it will not be so much a case of primus inter pares as of less than par inter primos, unlike the position of the President of the Commission in future, for which again I am glad."
"Although we have rightly heard a certain sense of alarm about the dual presidency, it may not be as bad as it sounds, like the music of Wagner."
"At the Convention I had the honour of representing - as alternate member - the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and in particular the European Free Alliance subset representing the stateless nations of Europe - the small countries."
"I rejoice, as I said the other day, to see the flags of the new countries that come in."
"But not all the little countries of Europe are as yet - or intended to be - Member States of Europe."
"It is therefore vitally important to ask ourselves, as we contemplate a new constitution for Europe, about the future position of Catalonia (comparable in size to Hungary), of Scotland (comparable in size to the Slovak Republic), of Galicia or Wales (comparable in size to Latvia)."
"What will be the way in which this Union works?"
"Mr de Gaulle was happy to pour contempt on the idea of subsidiarity."
"If we do not recognise that this is going to have to be a Europe of democracy at many levels, which takes subsidiarity seriously and takes it in a transitive sense right through the Member States, to all the countries of Europe, it will not work."
"I hope that will not be the case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Thessaloniki European Council was dominated by the presentation of the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention."
"In that respect, it could thus be said that a political process which began at the Laeken Council has come full circle."
"At Laeken, less than two years ago, the Heads of State or Government decided to set up a convention whose aim was to consider the main problems facing the future development of the Union."
"As we all know, the Convention's task was to draw up a final document which under the terms of the Laeken conclusions themselves, may - and I quote - 'comprise either different options, indicating the degree of support which they received, or recommendations if consensus is achieved.'."
"Very much under the impetus of its President, the Convention rose to this challenge issued at Laeken by seeking out a third way. This consisted of drawing up a complete draft Constitutional Treaty, a kind of closed structural framework for the future of the Union."
"It is worth saying that the text of the Convention was not a consensual one and nor could it have been."
"Without going into detail, we must recognise that there were many contradictions, controversies, omissions as well as successes which, taken together, resulted in a necessarily imperfect synthesis. This synthesis will put to the test the ability of governments of Member States to cooperate and take decisions at the next Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)."
"This is why the Convention's work was rightly considered by the Council to be a mere starting point, not a final destination."
"A good starting point, it is true, but no more than that."
"Mr President, I would like to outline two final points."
"The first is to note that, if the solution favoured by the Convention for the future of the Presidency of the European Council goes ahead, the Greek Presidency will remain inextricably linked to the beginning of the end of the excellent democratic practice, carried out every six months here in the European Parliament, of assessing the work of the Presidencies."
"These regular debates on major European issues will come to a ruinous end without the least profit or advantage being drawn from it, as far as I can see. To my mind, the opposite is the case."
"This is undoubtedly due to my own shortcomings, but that fact does not prevent me from expressing one desire. This is the desire that the balance-sheet of the Greek Presidency that we are drawing up today should not be a final balance-sheet, the beginning of the end of a way of undertaking the Presidency of the Union which we consider crucial to safeguarding equality between Member States."
"To sum up, and I will end on this second point, we would like to congratulate the Greek Government on the excellent results of its completed Presidency. We are sorry, however, that this is the last time we will be able to pass on our congratulations to Greece in the same circumstances."
"Mr President, the favourable comments heard in the House on the Greek Presidency, like the favourable comments in the past on other Presidencies are, I think, the most decisive argument in favour of maintaining this system of rotating Presidencies at the helm of the European Union and, of course, not in favour of what is being proposed in the new Constitutional Treaty, which has clear disadvantages."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are here to criticise the work of the Presidency of the Council constructively, honestly and in good faith on the basis of your report."
"I shall focus my attention mainly on the issues on which no progress was made, not in order to grumble, but because it is good for us to remember the things that were not done, so that we can put them in order and make progress with them."
"I would say that there was a delay in the immigration sector, because there is not one word in the conclusions of the summit Council about the question of setting up a European border guard, while the Commission is absolutely convinced about it and has announced it."
"Why this standstill on such an acute problem?"
"Similarly, the issue of financial solidarity and an equal division of the burden in the immigration sector has essentially been lost, even though it was also a priority of your programme, in that no special funding means have been adopted, as proposed by the Commission."
"Similarly, I would say that the common European asylum system was not introduced and, finally, we have no readmission agreements."
"What readmission agreements were concluded?"
"How can 2 000 to 3 000 illegal immigrants from a country which maintains relations with the European Union, I am talking about Turkey of course, be caught and readmission not be accepted?"
"Readmission applications are being made - if I remember correctly over 1 400 - and only 14 have been accepted."
"Where is the strength and will of Europe on such an important issue, which has not only economic, but also, more importantly, humanitarian consequences."
"I would hasten to emphasise that guarding the external borders of the Union would also help in the foreign policy and security policy sector, where the Union is suffering, because this precisely constitutes the cornerstone of foreign policy and defence."
"Now, on the Lisbon strategy I cannot but find that the political and economic uncertainties remain."
"The prospects for sustainable development in Europe appear to be a distant hope."
"For the reform of the CAP, I believe that you realise that the debate on the mid-term review carried out has not been completed, in that a series of products have not been included in the decisions."
"Finally, as far as the future of Europe is concerned, I absolutely agree with President Prodi that the Constitutional Treaty does indeed contain some very important and positive points; however, it also contains certain elements which give a great deal of cause for concern."
"I shall start with your phrase, that we share the future in a Community of values, to ask, how do we share the future?"
"Divided into blocs of large and small countries, with the reinforced ability of the former to affect decisions?"
"With duality?"
"Double structures?"
"In other words, something which the most simple company or government official knows leads to adversity, confusion and, ultimately, inefficiency?"
"Or by cutting the right of each Member State to equal representation by a Commissioner in the Commission?"
"Under these conditions, how will the interest of countries and, above all, their citizens, be maintained?"
"And what Community of values?"
"The Community in which it is not the Community model of the European Union but intergovernmental cooperation that is being extended?"
"And, finally, what values?"
"Those which we do not dare refer to expressly in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, offering the citizens - whose support we crave - the political education and values of a last-minute compromise?"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to start with, I could not reply to you in a language other than that which we spoke when we were at school together fifty years ago."
"First of all, I want to thank you and warmly congratulate you for the particularly successful presidency which the Greek Government has brought to a close."
"As you have heard from the honourable Members' interventions - and the interventions which do not come from the same political family are more valuable - there is generally a feeling that the Greek Presidency was a great success."
"Nonetheless, I do not want to refer to the issues already raised, but to another issue: during the Greek Presidency, what you euphemistically refer to as the 'Iraqi crisis' took place."
"I think that the Greek Presidency took the best possible reaction to the division which the European Union underwent in relation to this issue in convening the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels on 17 February 2003 and with the outcome of that Council."
"The Greek Presidency is not to blame for the fact that some of the participants did not honour their own signatures before the week was out."
"I shall continue in German, the language of the country which I represent here in the European Parliament, knowing also that you will not therefore need to wear headphones."
"The European Heads of Government in Thessaloniki spoke almost continually of the need for speaking with one voice."
"That is what they all want, as long as that voice is their own."
"If they do not let go of this attitude, little will change, despite the Convention and despite Mr Solana's interesting document."
"There is little one can say in the way of criticism about his analysis, but therein lies at the same time its weakness."
"The report speaks about what unites us but is silent about what divides us, and that, in practice, is precisely the problem with 25 Member States."
"The threats in an enlarged Union do not only lie beyond Europe's borders but also within them."
"We can see eye to eye with Mr Solana at the abstract level, but God forbid that this should become a little more concrete."
"I fear, above all, an internal rift about the attitude with regard to America's role in the world, and hence about how to tackle the major breeding grounds of conflict."
"Mr Solana is right to say that an effective European Union could have a considerable impact, one that is conducive to a fair, safe and multilateral world."
"We must develop our own security policy, but we have not managed to do this to date, unfortunately."
"The Iraq crisis was not only about Iraq, but also about a new distribution of power in the world and inside the European Union."
"Since the fall of the wall, external policy in the European Union has been re-nationalised."
"Heads of Government, especially those of major Member States, seek to compensate for the loss of national sovereignty and identity in many areas by raising their own national profile in the area of foreign policy."
"Unfortunately, the Convention bears out current practice by maintaining the rule of consensus."
"Even the voice of a European super-Minister for Foreign Affairs can only be heard when the cacophony of his national colleagues has fallen silent."
"Mr President-in-Office, in Thessaloniki you made progress on the issue of the Western Balkans and their prospects of acceding to the European Union."
"That is very good."
"However, you did not succeed in laying down a timetable."
"I greatly fear that we shall not anticipate the new conflicts on their way."
"Secondly: the invasion of Iraq has been followed by military occupation, with the logic behind a military occupation, men in balaclavas, police spies and so on."
"Politically, what do we say to these gentlemen, whom we sometimes call allies and certain of whom are also members of the European Union?"
"I do not understand."
"I do not think that we resolve any problems by politically appeasing allies."
"Thirdly: you have signed an agreement with the USA."
"The European Parliament accused you on the grounds that this was democratic infringement."
"The article which you chose excludes the parliaments; however, it says that the Member States can express objections if their internal order so requires."
"Will Greece do so?"
"Fourthly and lastly, the matter of the Constitutional Treaty really did progress, but with opaque and, in my opinion, very dangerous procedures, which may even change the essence of everything the Convention has done."
"Question: how will we safeguard the politicisation of the unification of Europe and the limited cooperation which can give impetus to those who really want to do something different against American efforts to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator?"
"Will Greece hold a referendum as part of this effort at politicisation?"
"I do not say this to detract from all the positive things said, but to remind you that politics go on and that there are very serious issues outstanding, including for the continuation of political life in Europe."
"Mr President, I want to talk about one of the annexes to the Council declaration, in particular that on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"This is to be welcomed, and I know we will return to this many times in the future."
"We particularly welcome the statement in Paragraph 2 that 'weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation puts at risk the security of our states, our peoples and our interests around the world'."
"However, I regret that meeting this challenge is only taken up in terms of European Union external action."
"We should hope that the efforts regarding non-proliferation will apply to all states already in possession of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and those which may develop the capacity, and not just states which are seen as unfriendly, as opposed to those which our foreign policy supports."
"Turning to other questions, my group certainly welcomes the efforts made by the Greek Presidency on the question of temporary agency work, currently blocked through more political game-playing by particular Member States."
"It is clear that we need more progress on workers' rights and the implementation of existing rights, for example in terms of mass redundancies, as in the case of Schiesser-Palco in Athens, and the questions about retraining and social protection which follow that."
"The Council really needs to start questioning whether Lisbon is working as well as people think it is in terms of the provision of high-quality jobs and the social cohesion which was sought at Lisbon."
"In one of those areas we need to look at the relationship between that and the World Trade Organisation agreements and proposals we are currently following, and to see whether we will be able to safeguard social and environmental rights within the European Union and encourage and support such development in poorer countries under the current regime."
"Finally, I want to pick up the question about tax evasion, which the Prime Minister mentioned, and hope that future presidencies - I do not hold out much hope for the next one - will look at this question of tax evasion within the European Union and beyond it, because at the moment we are losing fortunes from our public budgets due to the non-payment of taxes by corporations."
"Mr President, the conclusions of the Thessaloniki Summit relating to immigration represent an encouraging milestone insofar as major decisions are made with regard to the management of external borders and the policy on the return of illegal migrants, not least in terms of the European Union's financial undertaking."
"However, on this extremely serious issue, the European institutions continue to suffer, so to speak, from an endemic reluctance across the board to address, head-on, the challenge represented by the activity of the criminal Mafia organisations which organise the despicable trafficking of human beings, which frequently causes tragedies such as those portrayed on television screens in the houses of all European citizens throughout the world, where a picture is painted which certainly discredits the European institutions as well."
"There are still a number of questions on this matter which were not clearly raised at the Thessaloniki Summit."
"Europe is not addressing the relationship between illegal immigration and terrorism, and yet Al Qaeda members are identified daily in the ghettos of illegal immigration."
"Just recently, a criminal network has been identified in my country whose members have even penetrated the reception centres."
"What if, instead of merely aiding the criminal trafficking of illegal immigrants, these had been members of Islamic terrorist organisations?"
"Furthermore, why are adequate health protection measures not laid down, not least in the interests of the immigrants, given the extremely unstable health situations endemic in the countries and regions of origin of illegal immigrants?"
"Consider the situation in Algeria, with the plague crisis."
"Moreover, has Europe considered, or does it intend to consider, the need to protect, not least from the point of view of protecting the Union and its natural resources, areas such as the islands and coastal regions of southern Italy, where illegal immigrants leave the ships of traffickers?"
"The island of Lampedusa, with its extraordinarily beautiful countryside - one of the last strips of European land before Africa - and the Costa Domiziana are parts of our European heritage which are unique in their beautiful scenery."
"For how much longer must they continue to be transformed into reception camps for floods of illegal immigrants?"
"In this sense, the UK proposal to place reception centres outside Europe's borders is to be welcomed."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the Greek Presidency will be forever associated with the picture at the foot of the Acropolis, where the reunification of Europe took place."
"We will also forever associate it with a sense of gratitude."
"We will also see, however, that this presidency saw a great failure on the part of Europe - not that the Greek Presidency is responsible for this; we all are - namely the inability of us Europeans to have a common position on an issue of war and peace."
"Lessons were learnt from this and it gave the Convention impetus to make perhaps greater progress on aspects of the foreign, security and defence policy than we had initially thought possible."
"This is also true of the discussions on a strategic concept for the European Union that have been taking place and will continue in Thessaloniki, so that we are better prepared in terms of content in the future and have our own system for weighing up interests, from which a better operational policy will emerge at Community level in the future."
"We must be aware that what has been achieved in the Convention is marred by several mistakes."
"At the last moment the Convention's courage failed it and in its final 14 days it clearly does not wish to try to move more foreign policy issues to majority voting."
"The idea that in the future one country would be able to block 25 others on an issue of foreign policy, with no way out, is a painful one, and there is the risk of an opportunity being missed."
"I would ask you once again, Mr President, to define what is meant in the Thessaloniki Conclusions in respect of Part III by purely technical work, so that we can make progress on majority decision-making - particularly in foreign policy but also in other areas - and so that this does not serve as an excuse for our not being able to discuss anything further."
"The proposals that have been made by government representatives in the Convention seem at least not to be technical, when I look at the proposal that the German Foreign Minister has tabled on behalf of the Federal Government about a foreign service."
"If a footnote in Part III - this being declared to be technical - leads to our own foreign service being set up, drawing its staff from the Commission or the Council and including national civil servants, under the exclusive competence of the foreign minister, this will constitute a dramatic change in the balance between the institutions and a dramatic weakening of the Commission and ultimately also of Parliament."
"It is unacceptable for us now to create further bureaucracy for the important position of foreign minister."
"Ours is a twofold task: we are to merge areas and not create anything new that will make life even more difficult in the future and will be harder to monitor."
"We do not need any new fiefdoms; instead we need to integrate areas and I hope that attempts will be made with your help to gain control of this."
"I would therefore urge you to help us in this matter, and I would ask you once again to define the word 'technical', so that we can still make progress in the Convention this week and next, and in this context also to tell us why Part IV cannot be touched."
"The Convention has not yet debated Parts III and IV."
"It should have the right to do so, and governments should not prevent it from doing so."
"Mr President, I am going to refer to the Thessaloniki agenda in relation to immigration and asylum."
"Compared to the Seville conclusions, I find it genuinely interesting, although, having heard Mr Borghezio, I am wondering whether my analysis may be mistaken."
"Seriously, I believe that the Council has returned to a more global and balanced vision of immigration, reducing the decibels of its declarations, but in a more measured way increasing the intensity of the measures adopted."
"I take a positive view of the option of guaranteeing border control by means of a Community operative structure for cooperation."
"Border control is necessary, but it is only one part of immigration policy, Mr President, and it has its limits: in terms of security, because criminals do not normally use their documents or cross borders by the usual routes, and in terms of the management of migratory flows, because the majority of immigrants currently residing in Europe, without documentation, crossed the borders originally in a legal fashion, as students, with an initial work permit or as tourists, but the border was crossed legally in any case."
"In fact, the situation at maritime borders is dramatic and people have a very negative perception of it, since they feel subjected to a dual tension: fear of a phenomenon which appears to be out of control, and a tremendous compassion which we all feel when we see, sometimes, bodies reaching our coasts."
"In terms of numbers, however, this is very limited compared to the overall phenomenon of immigration."
"The Tampere element is needed, and its application does not require money, but does require political courage."
"It is also necessary to create a common legislative framework for legal entry and for the harmonisation of asylum."
"Similarly, readmission agreements are just one part of the relationship with third countries."
"We should use a little imagination so that, in a world such as ours, in which everything has the potential to move within a global framework, the movement of people can become a virtuous circle, generating a little wealth for third countries, for our neighbours and for us."
"We will need this imagination."
"Furthermore, Mr President, please allow me to end by congratulating you on having accepted, for the first time, the need for a European integration policy and on having correctly identified its objectives and the need to implement them with local and regional authorities and social actors."
"We have a lot at stake in this field."
"The co-existence of our Member States is at stake."
"I only hope - and I congratulate you on your Presidency - that your successors will deal with this issue with the same care as you."
"Mr President, I too appreciate greatly that the Greek Presidency has taken an enlightened approach to facilitating legal migration and integration, not just fighting illegal immigration."
"In an important presidency conference on the theme in Athens and in securing agreement on the family-reunion and long-term-residents directives you have gone some way to rebalance the EU agenda which has been much too focused until now on control and rejection."
"The EU's role in offering refugees protection has been under assault from some governments, notably the UK."
"I am glad that Thessaloniki rejected the preposterous suggestion that all EU asylum seekers should be driven back towards the Third World or EU fringe countries."
"The prospect of vast detention camps, raising the spectre of concentration camps, was rightly a step too far for some Member States."
"We need to get order in our asylum systems with a common EU system that does not shift responsibility but shares it."
"This would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another sees its numbers peak."
"We can only have a true partnership on migration with third countries if we offer their people adequate alternative opportunities, especially in agriculture."
"The CAP with its export subsidies and import protection is a gross barrier to trade justice."
"You have made some reform progress but not enough."
"My colleague Mr Watson rightly deplored the manner and content of the EU-US legal cooperation and extradition agreements."
"I agree with him."
"However, I welcome that the summit issued a clarion call of strong support for the International Criminal Court."
"The EU must stand up to the outrageous US bullying to undermine the court."
"Finally, the accession signing ceremony took place at the foot of the Acropolis where the new Parthenon museum is also located."
"I represent London where the British Museum is located, but I take a rather softer line than its director on the so-called Elgin Marbles and I hope some arrangement for transfer, even if only a loan, can be reached before next year's Olympics."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has discussed various aspects of the process of the EU's enlargement, and these were also addressed in Thessaloniki."
"From this, the impression is created that the process is currently going hand in hand with less stringent criteria."
"In the past, we most definitely did not want to set down any dates for the start of negotiations, the end of negotiations or for accession to the European Union."
"Nowadays, dates are being suggested quite spontaneously which, in themselves, are also being interpreted in all kinds of ways."
"With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, our resolution was reported to state initially that we appreciate it that those countries have set themselves a target date, namely 2004."
"We have not given an opinion either way, but we are increasingly hearing that we assume that the negotiations can be finalised by the end of 2004."
"One cannot help wondering whether conditions are also being prescribed for the implementation of what is being laid down in law."
"Will, for example, Romania be a country that functions normally by 2007, or will it still be weighed down by corruption and political power-play that overlook the interests of the general public?"
"We never imagined that what we used to call the two waves would follow each other in such quick succession."
"We are therefore surprised about those dates 2004-2007 for Romania and Bulgaria."
"The western Balkans and Kosovo are also being mentioned in the same breath."
"I should note in this connection, and it must be patently clear to the authorities in Kosovo, that nobody here wants an ethnically-based Member State."
"Could this be a case, perhaps, of misplaced guilt in respect of the candidates left behind?"
"This feeling is not present among Union citizens."
"The people have become more critical; the importance of a well-functioning Europe has become greater."
"The economic political problems of the new accession states have also grown and meanwhile, it seems as if the Council and Commission have become more lenient."
"Then, as the President-in-Office of the Council also mentioned there is the largest potential enlargement: the accession of Turkey."
"Unfortunately, a date has also been set for the start of negotiations while no conditions have been laid down for this."
"According to Turkey's interpretation, this is an unconditional date."
"It would be unfortunate if the Council and the Commission were susceptible to Turkey's criticism that they are not reacting quickly enough and that surely, Turkey has now waited long enough, while it is we who have waited for the changes in Turkey to take place."
"Luckily, the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the minorities, religious freedom and the position of the army."
"The Commission on its part has promised an inquiry into the role of the army."
"This strikes me as extremely important, provided this does not simply look into the extent to which the current situation at the start of the negotiations about other chapters can be maintained as much as possible."
"It appears to me that a priority has been set here which we must handle with the greatest of care."
"We must also deal with the changes in Turkey required by us with due care."
"These cannot simply be made in the course of a few years without causing major damage."
"We should not be guided by a fear of driving Turkey away in this."
"After all, the introduction of quasi-Iranian conditions is probably the last thing the army will allow."
"This calls for staying power and caution."
"The solution to the Cyprus problem, in particular, will be one of the benchmarks for Turkey's accession, because that is where the army's role is felt most acutely."
"The Balladur initiative on borders and good neighbourliness are, in fact, the basis for Copenhagen's political conditions."
"It would be naive to think that no country would use its veto if Cyprus were not re-united."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency of the Council on what it has achieved in its six months, in a difficult situation: on Iraq - as we have heard - and also on specific dossiers like the European Statute for Political Parties, where a lot of hard work was put in."
"The ministers will know that I do not say this just out of politeness because I have also voiced friendly criticism of some aspects of the Greek legal system."
"I did so, for instance, when a constituent of mine - Mr David Wilson - who is now facing an appeal in the Greek courts, was arrested and sentenced within 24 hours of his arrest to 12 years in jail, after some stowaway asylum-seekers were found hidden at the back of his lorry without his knowledge."
"So you know that my praise is genuine because sometimes I do not hesitate to criticise."
"The key issue of the period of the Greek Presidency is the constitution."
"In the long run that will be the most significant thing."
"I congratulate the presidency on getting the form of words agreed in Thessaloniki - that the constitution will be the basis for the negotiation of a new treaty in the IGC."
"The Convention has not quite finished its work."
"Part III, at least, is going to be subject to a technical revision: such technicalities as how to vote in the Council, the technique of voting by QMV or unanimity."
"That shows that technicalities can sometimes also be of the highest political significance."
"It is important that progress be made on that."
"But once we have a completed result from the Convention the battle then moves on to getting it intact through the IGC."
"The IGC must not unravel the Convention, must not pick it apart."
"As soon as we start moving one little bit of the constitution, there will somebody else who wants to remove another bit of it, and the whole thing could fall apart."
"On the contrary, we must all unite to say that this must be the basis on which we move forward."
"If there are going to be changes they should only be small, detailed and technical changes to the constitution."
"I welcome the reference in the conclusions of Thessaloniki to the participation of Parliament in the IGC."
"The details still need to be spelt out but we now have an acquis from the Amsterdam and Nice negotiations that the European Parliament participates via its President in the meetings at the level of ministers and via two representatives at the level of the working group that does the negotiating."
"That at the very least should be the basis on which Parliament participates in this IGC."
"Mr President, I too should like to wish that a Greek prime minister will pass through the European Parliament in a few years' time under the rotating Presidency, which is a useful institution, to thank Mr Yiannitsis for the good cooperation we had and, in the short time which I have, to wish that the President-in-Office of the Council and Prime Minister of Greece will resolve, not in the remaining hours of his Presidency, but over the coming days, an important issue to which the letter sent to him by 90 members of the European Parliament also referred, in other words, the application of Directive 70/1999 on fixed-term workers."
"I would like to believe that, taking account of the views of the Commission and the European Parliament, as well as the decisions by the Greek courts, the Greek Government will set a good example in this basic sector, which concerns tens of thousands of workers and in which fixed-term contracts are being abused."
"There are still people who sign unilateral fixed-term contracts for 15 years."
"I would like to hope that the Prime Minister will address it positively and I should like, if he can, for him to take a position on this issue in his second speech."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without a doubt these six months of the Greek Presidency have been some of the most dramatic in the recent history of the European Union, and I think that we can compliment the Greek Presidency on doing its job with great sensitivity, consistency and energy."
"Three major issues have dominated this period as they do this debate: enlargement; the war in Iraq and the significance that it has had for Europe and will also continue to have in the future, and the Convention."
"Enlargement - the great historic project of our generation - is well on the way to being completed successfully."
"For us enlargement already has a human face, in the shape of the colleagues who are already working here as observers."
"As an aside, I should like to mention that we in Germany were interested to note that after Parliament's decision on enlargement the Czech Government for example issued a statement on the injustice of expulsion, which is along the right lines and gives us hope that here too the process of reconciliation may reach a successful conclusion."
"The war in Iraq made it clear where Europe's borders lie and showed where we need even more Community: primarily in the field of foreign and security policy."
"So far Europe has played no role at all here or at best a pitiful one."
"It really should strike people that where Europe uses the Community method, such as on internal market issues, we operate on an equal footing with for example the United States of America, but that where we work on an intergovernmental basis, we play no part at all."
"This has to change in the future and the Convention needs to make a contribution to achieving this."
"I hope that it will still succeed in doing so before 10 July of this year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, Greece was not found wanting in its encounter with history."
"Indeed, the draft Constitution, whose preparation Greece showed it could oversee so clearheadedly, makes a decisive contribution to European history."
"After a period of national constitutionalism, we are now witnessing a period of European constitutionalism."
"Moreover, though sceptics may criticise this European constitutionalism, which will not replace national constitutions. Instead, it represents a break, a highly creative shift in the European spirit."
"Greece has also, however, shown itself worthy of the classical humanism as expressed by Gorgias, who said 'man is the measure of all things'."
"It also showed it could resist those who wanted to turn immigration policy into a tool of repression against those immigrants who are attracted to Europe as a land of work, prosperity and peace. Greece showed that it could resist, furthermore, by pointing the way to a suitable immigration and asylum policy."
"When confronted with the storm over Iraq, the war in Iraq, moreover, Greece showed it could remain upright and clearheaded, and could once again point to the way forward, which took the form of an independent European defence policy and identity, still within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance."
"Greece, which, we should remember, invented the democratic city-state in ancient Athens, showed that it could contribute decisively to developing and strengthening a new form of democracy, typical of the European character: the European Union on a continent-wide scale."
"Greece showed it could also contribute to that process of enlargement by proposing that the western Balkans join the European Union in the long term."
"In the same way, Greece, and especially its prime minister, Mr Simitis, showed it could restore its troubled relations with Turkey. It showed it could move beyond their historic dispute and prove that nations do not have to be permanently at war."
"Greece showed it could open up to Turkey, that great country which has always been present on the European political scene, in the good times and in the bad."
"Just one reservation: the CAP, which perpetuates serious inequalities in the distribution of resources between farmers and countries."
"Lastly, the Greek Presidency showed it could reconcile the world of Platonic ideas with Aristotelian realism."
"The art of politics in Greece cannot be separated from philosophy, just as the art of politics in Europe must not be separated from philosophy either, otherwise it will always be susceptible to the temptations of religious fundamentalism and repressive ideologies."
"The spirit of Europe today is the spirit of Greece, and the spirit of Greece is the spirit of Europe."
"It is my earnest wish that the future permanent presidency of the European Union, which I support, unlike so many, will always show it can be like the Greek Presidency. I hope that the latter will be an example for the permanent presidency of the European Council in future."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to echo the positive words about the Greek Presidency."
"I should immediately like to follow this up with the comment that this is yet another example of how small countries often make better presidents than large ones, and that we should not be so quick to give large countries priority."
"Greece is a case in point."
"You have dealt with a number of very heavy dossiers, and the finalisation of the accession dossiers on the Acropolis on 16 June gave us a stunning picture, also for those who were only able to follow the proceedings on television. I do not think we could have imagined a more beautiful spot and a more beautiful image."
"It was, of course, coincidental that these dossiers happened to be finalised during the Greek Presidency, but it was a very happy coincidence."
"The Convention's work has also been guided in a very positive manner."
"Greece assumed a hands-off approach and gave latitude to the Convention itself."
"I myself was - indeed, I still am - a member of that Convention, and I can vouch for the fact that the result that is now before us is mainly due to the way in which the MPs and MEPs have joined forces."
"The MEPs and members of the national parliaments worked together much more effectively than some government representatives."
"There is, therefore, the risk that the governments are going to put a spanner in the works."
"An amazing amount has been achieved: values and standards have been established, the Charter has been adopted, the pillars have disappeared, decisions will be taken by qualified majority more often, democratisation has moved on by quite a long way, parliamentary control has been stepped up, transparency enhanced and the institutional structure improved, the only discordant note being that we are now, after all, getting a President, something that many did not actually want."
"Unanimity in foreign policy is, in my view, a major disadvantage, and it really should not have been adopted."
"During the Iraq crisis, we saw what became of Europe if everything is to be decided unanimously."
"If any changes are yet to be made, therefore, then this aspect is a definite contender."
"I also share Mr Prodi's view that it is odd that half of the Commissioners are entitled to vote and the other half are not - this is somewhat out of order."
"We should, however, change as little as possible to this proposal and try to guide it through the process as well as we can."
"If we manage to do this during the coming six months under the Italian Presidency, then Europe will have taken another big step and we will have a bright future ahead of us with those 25 countries."
"You have helped to make this happen."
"Mr President, when the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, referred to the Greek Presidency as brilliant, he articulated not a diplomatic, but an historic speech."
"I shall refer to just three of the many and useful successes of the Greek Presidency that justify Mr Chirac, allowing - especially today - my national modesty to take second place to my satisfaction as a European."
"First, Greece had the misfortune, but Europe had the fortune, that the Greek Presidency coincided with the huge moral - without doubt moral - crisis which the European Union underwent in the consciousness of the European citizens with the stance taken by certain of its members on the illegal war against Iraq."
"This sort of incident could have resulted in the break up of the European Union."
"The Greek Presidency managed not only to prevent it from breaking up, but also to express the European Union with a word of consent, which will certainly withstand the criticism of tomorrow's historians."
"Of course, in the future we shall have work to do to restore the moral credibility of Europe as a whole."
"The second major historic event during the Greek Presidency was the positive decision on the Constitutional Treaty submitted to the European Council in Halkidiki by the Convention through its chairman."
"The text submitted takes historic steps, it interconnects the European institutions more firmly, it safeguards more than ever before the social state, crowned with the concept of full employment, for which Georgos Katiforis deserves particular thanks."
"However, it also has serious shortcomings, some of which have already been pointed out by previous speakers."
"The European Parliament, in the report which I have the honour of having undertaken together with President Gil Robles, will expose these weaknesses in the Treaty."
"The Greek Presidency respected the institution of the Convention and its results and thus politically - and this is important - the institution of the Convention was established as one of the major accomplishments of European democracy."
"Finally, I would refer to the likewise historic fact that, after seven years of being unable to take a decision, common positions were found with the European Parliament so that the regulation on the operation and funding of political parties could finally enter into force."
"This is extremely important in consolidating the European democratic institutions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when we review the Greek Presidency we can say with complete justification that it is hard to see how a permanent Council President could have done better."
"After this presidency we will clearly have to explain to the public what additional benefit Europe is supposed to derive from the creation of a new post such as that of Council President, a president appointed from the ranks of the Council."
"Obviously the Convention, which has already been mentioned here several times, has resulted in a compromise and the Intergovernmental Conference, too, will ultimately result in a compromise."
"Nevertheless, the Convention's weak points should not be overlooked, even if the worst has been avoided."
"There is however still the issue - which the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, mentioned - of the dual presidency of the European Union."
"Even if the Council President has no legislative competence, that person will still represent the European Union to the outside world and it will be their personality that will determine what they make of the office."
"This may give rise to conflicts within the EU."
"On the arduous path to a Common Foreign and Security Policy, a post of common foreign minister has now also been created, which is supposed to combine the two functions carried out by the previous agents."
"This undoubtedly constitutes progress, but creating a post does not yet mean that a common policy has been created."
"The foreign minister - who is yet to be appointed - will embody the schizophrenia of the European Union."
"Above all, however, subdividing the Commissioners into those with voting rights and those without is a real structural defect, particularly where the Commission remains a collective body."
"I can certainly understand that, when faced with an EU of 25 or more Member States, some may long for the times when there was a Community of six."
"But artificially scaling down the European Union by dividing it into a core Europe and the rest undermines the European Union's cohesion and also public trust in the European institutions."
"This weakness should therefore be remedied."
"Mr President, the Greek Presidency of the Council has managed to do good work under tragic international circumstances and in an economically and politically unpromising climate."
"For that reason, I too should like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council."
"Much has been achieved in many areas, but the Presidency of the Council will, of course, be best remembered for the kick-off of the final decision on the constitutional treaty."
"I hope that this will result in an Intergovernmental Conference that will decide to sign a treaty that is actually based on the Convention's conclusions."
"Not only was the method of the Convention a sound choice, the leading triumvirate was one too, and it is fortunate that the Convention's ordinary members have also added value in a significant manner."
"Anyone taking part in European debates nowadays is mainly faced with criticism, and I admit that we are keen to join in. What we agree on is something that we believe to be already as good as established, something we believe to be very much a matter of course and for which we have been asking for a long time."
"As regards the things that we think are less successful, we hope that they can still be rectified, obviously in the direction we indicate."
"We should not overlook the fact that there is still to be an IGC, and that we still need to convince the public."
"We should therefore not be tempted only to focus on our minor or major disappointments, but rather look at the whole picture and, with a sense of balance, point at the increased opportunities for transparency and at the Union's decisive policy."
"Despite this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too should very much like to know whether the mandate which the Convention has with regard to Part III still leaves enough room for the Convention to file down a few layers of the remaining veto rights, whether the Convention now has the authority or not to change anything to Part IV and whether the European Council actually believes itself that the Union can hold out beyond the period of the next financial perspectives to work with the current financing mechanism."
"I am really happy today to be a Christian Democrat; not because we are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary, but mainly because our ideology takes as its starting point the need to believe in people."
"You cannot rely on structures alone."
"The structures with which the Convention provides us will not, on their own, enable us to move mountains."
"We will therefore need to rely on responsible people, and I hope that there are many of those left in Europe."
"Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, in common with many others, I wish to thank the Greek Presidency for fulfilling its responsibilities so well during a difficult period."
"For me, the high point of this Presidency was the signing of the accession treaties on 16 April."
"It is an historic event, meaning that our divided Europe has come to an end."
"The future entails not only a more peaceful Europe but also a more democratic one."
"I must just say a few words about the Lisbon strategy."
"A great deal has been done during the Greek Presidency, for example on coordinating the economic and employment guidelines and the social process, something that I applaud."
"You also listened constructively to Parliament's points of view on the employment guidelines."
"In particular, you took account of what Parliament had to say on the matters relating to equality between men and women."
"I also want to commend you for the pensions strategy put forward during your Presidency, which I believe strikes a sound balance between economic and social aspects."
"That is important now that we have to review our pensions systems throughout Europe."
"I regret the handling of one issue, namely sustainable development."
"Sustainable development is as yet still only a matter of words, and we have not done very much to give more specific content to sustainable development, for example in the form of indicators."
"I also regret that we did not succeed in reaching an agreement on the matter of staffing companies."
"When it comes to the Convention, I agree with what many others have already said, namely that it has been a success, partly due to its content and partly due to the way in which the work has been done."
"As Mrs Berès said, this must now be followed up at the Intergovernmental Conference too, and Parliament must be involved in the ongoing handling of the issue so that the transparency that has now been achieved can be maintained."
"When, finally, it comes to asylum and refugee policy, I welcome the fact that the proposal for protection zones was removed."
"At the same time, I regret, however, that we have still not obtained a common asylum and refugee policy with common minimum rules."
"In the future, we need a common asylum and refugee policy based upon generosity and humanity."
"Mr President, even applying the principle that nothing is ever perfect in life, I have to say that I have difficulty in imagining a better Presidency than that which is coming to an end today."
"The Greek Presidency has succeeded in combining the major themes, already widely addressed - such as enlargement, supporting the Convention and establishing a very balanced, wise position in foreign policy - with everyday issues which are important for the citizens of Europe."
"Over these past six months, a relatively short time, we have brought a number of extremely important dossiers to a conclusion."
"We have made progress in financial dossiers, closed the energy dossier and implemented and extended major programmes such as Erasmus and eLearning: I therefore endorse your work."
"I can see only one flaw: the conclusion of the position on agriculture."
"I am fully aware of the macroeconomic situation;"
"I am fully aware of the need for the European Union to adopt a clear foreign policy with regard to the developing countries too."
"Nevertheless, the conclusion of the agriculture package last week is causing me some concern, for, in actual fact, we have instigated a process of dismantling our continent's primary sector and we have, in reality, started to destroy the one genuine policy which has allowed the European Union to claim the title of Union thus far."
"I hope that there will be a rethink once Cancun is over, for, otherwise, Commissioner Fischler's position, promoted by the Agriculture Council, will affect what is not just a key sector for the economy but, most importantly, a key sector for consumers."
"In other words, we ask farmers for investment and commitments to safeguard the quality of foodstuffs and then we dismantle the various measures protecting the sector: this is a policy which I really cannot understand."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Services Action Plan has been fast-tracked, the accession treaties signed - bringing the reunification of Europe one step closer - the Balkan Initiative launched and the first two parts of the draft constitution presented. Nevertheless, in the last few weeks we have been forced to recognise that where the war in Iraq was concerned personal vanity and national egoism proved to be stronger than the aim of a common foreign policy and that as a result we did not play a part in the 'war or peace' decision."
"We succeed when we act as a Community; we fail when we reduce Europe to the level of an intergovernmental enterprise."
"Acting as a Community means not having a national veto with the system of unanimity, but having greater public participation with qualified double majorities."
"The internal market will become a domestic market for 25 only when they all have the euro as their currency and Parliament is given a right to codecision on tax issues that are relevant to the internal market."
"The EU foreign minister will be more than an important and necessary job title only if we have codecision for foreign policy."
"Europe is more than the sum of its parts."
"Europe is more than the sum of the governments."
"All of us are Europe!"
"Each individual carries a degree of responsibility for the future of the whole."
"This way of seeing ourselves is however not yet a reality but still a dream, and that is why I propose that we do not move on to the agenda but have a more in-depth round of communication, information and social dialogue about the results of the last six months."
"That is also why I call for us to continue to apply the characteristics of the Convention - transparency, proximity to the people and democratisation."
"The Convention itself fostered this and that is why I think that a public opinion poll on the result of the Intergovernmental Conference would call for regions, nations and members of the public to be directly involved."
"It would give domestic policy a European dimension, it would make national movements European ones ahead of the forthcoming European elections, and it would inform the public that we are all part of Europe and successfully active in it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on just one point in your debate today."
"You mentioned it in only one sentence."
"I should like to say something about the Balkans and south-eastern Europe."
"I very much welcomed your initiative and I am also delighted that the Thessaloniki paper, that was prepared together with the Commission, has been adopted, because it contains much of what Parliament has demanded."
"Obviously I now hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that as an ordinary Member of the Council you will work together with the new Council Presidency to implement its content."
"We are still waiting for it to be implemented in the countries of the Balkans."
"It would be nice if the EU and the Council could actually agree to implement the decisions that they make in papers of this kind."
"This involves, for example, opening up education and youth programmes to the young people of these countries, which sends out an extremely important signal to them."
"It also involves annual reports on progress in the individual States, and the reinforcement of the twinning programme so as to modernise the administrative structures in these countries and make them ready for the accession that they have, of course, been promised."
"We expect there to be more cooperation in the region, particularly between Greece and Italy and these countries, on human trafficking and cross-border crime."
"We also hope that you will perhaps consider, together with your colleagues in the Council and the Commission, easing the visa requirements in a number of fields and for particular professions, so that people are able to gain faster entry to the European Union."
"I very much hope that positive progress is made when we start, as we are now doing, to initiate discussions between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians."
"I would be very pleased if you, as a country bordering the Balkans, could help to move this forward."
"I very much hope that the Serb, Roma and Ashkali refugees will at last be able to return to Kosovo so that the conditions can be put in place to enable them to live there side by side."
"I think that the Council and the Commission need to step up the pressure on the Albanians in Kosovo in this regard."
"We did not wage a war to have a situation today that is not wholly dissimilar to the unpleasant state of affairs that we have seen there over the last ten years."
"I believe that we need to be more deeply committed, because of course we want these countries to return to stability and peace."
"That is also the case in Serbia and I would urge you to use your influence to stop the Serbian Government continuing to gag journalists, as it is now doing."
"Media freedom in Serbia is under threat."
"Please give your word."
"Do not tolerate it!"
"Otherwise, thank you very much for your commitment."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the statement issued by the Thessaloniki Summit on the European Union's security policy was an important step towards a common European Security and Defence Policy."
"The United States have set out their security policy in clear terms, and it guides their actions on a day-to-day basis."
"A constructive response to it from the European Union is overdue and necessary."
"The paper tabled here is the beginning of a joint reply of this kind."
"If we take a closer look at it, we see that when it comes to analysing new threats in the world, joint statements are made that are extremely detailed and also completely accurate."
"But when it comes to defining the answers to them and saying what now needs to be done, we see that the system of unanimity makes it extremely difficult to come up with a coherent statement."
"That is why this paper can only be a beginning, a beginning with important statements."
"Nevertheless, we need a broad debate about this in the European Union, including in Parliament, so as to gradually formulate a common security strategy."
"We need clearer statements on our relations with NATO, on our relations with the United Nations, and on the roles that Russia and also Turkey will play in this security concept, and we need a clearer mandate - this too is addressed to the Intergovernmental Conference - for the arms agency that is now being proposed."
"Above all, however, we need a step-by-step plan."
"We have seen that the European Union has only ever carried out projects successfully when it has first had a plan setting out clear tasks and deadlines."
"Our job now is to formulate a more precise strategy of this kind for the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your comments and thoughts."
"Your many, very many positive criticisms fill all of us who participated in the Greek Presidency with great joy."
"Of the comments expressed, I shall pick out two or three issues."
"The first core issue to which you referred was the issue of the new Constitutional Treaty and the Convention."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as President-in-Office of the European Union, I visited the 24 Member States for the first time in order to prepare the summit in Halkidiki and to help so that the Constitutional Convention could finish its work."
"I thought I knew Europe well."
"However, I found that there are significant differences, not only social and political differences, of course, which were visible and known, but also as regards the perception of the issues of the European Union, the progress of Europe and European cooperation."
"There were countries which have a completely different perception of the Presidency from the perception all of you have and from what is happening or has happened in past years."
"I do not believe that we can find a solution to European issues unless we take account of these differences and try to find compromises."
"The new Member States in central Europe are living with the past, a past of repression by the Soviet Union."
"They are living with the fear of similar developments, they want to pay great attention to relations between the European Union and Russia, they set particular store by security issues, cooperation and participation in ????."
"We also know that the old countries in the European Union now have a different perspective, because they have seen that the European Union has overcome these problems."
"Therefore, compromises are needed on all issues."
"And a number of steps - either big or small - need to be taken."
"Besides, we cannot achieve the objectives we would like right from the start, the objectives, for example, of a Union which operates to a federal standard, with advanced central policies, a Union which has a uniform foreign policy without difficulties on all the issues etc."
"On the basis of these conclusions, I want to repeat that the compromise contained in the Convention's text is a good compromise."
"A good compromise, a good basis for further discussions, which will take place at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The issues of the Intergovernmental Conference will be resolved by the Italian Presidency, which will convene it, as agreed in Halkidiki, during October."
"That is also where the answers will be given about the participation of the European Parliament and the working method."
"That brings me to the question of what the technical issues mean in relation to the third chapter of the Constitutional Treaty."
"As we remember, the European Council decided that the work of the Convention should be completed by June and it insisted on this, as did the summit in March and the extraordinary informal summit held in Athens for that reason."
"We therefore said in Halkidiki that, as there is this decision, the Convention should not continue its work by changing this text or this compromise which was presented."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing said that the third chapter needs to be brought into line with the two previous chapters, that the method of expression or form of the third chapter are a method of expression and a form that need correction, which is why it was decided to extend the Convention, so that the work could continue within the framework of what had been agreed, on the basis of what had been agreed, and the third chapter could be brought into line with the previous chapters."
"Having said which, the Convention will, of course, have to decide what this harmonisation work will be, but the Council was clear that it does not want to reverse this arrangement or the compromise reached."
"So I think that good work was done and the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to finish according to the timetable."
"That brings me to the second issue raised, the issue of immigration."
"There is misinformation here."
"I was asked whether or not the single border guard had been decided or discussed."
"Of course it was discussed."
"The three Scandinavian countries and numerous countries of central Europe stated that, for constitutional reasons, they would not agree under any circumstances to this sort of guard and that this sort of guard is not possible."
"Consequently, because the objective is not for there to be a guard, but for there to be common action and coordination, we emphasised in particular in the decision taken in Halkidiki the need for common action and coordination, and various proposals are contained in the Commission text, which is also the basis for the decision on how this coordination will be achieved."
"As far as the distribution of the burden between the Member States is concerned, it exists."
"However, there is an erroneous perception, that decisions will be taken so that, for example, Germany will give Italy money to deal with immigration."
"That is not what it is about."
"It was decided that there would be common programmes, of the Union as a whole which, because they were applied in the Mediterranean, for example, or on the Union's eastern borders, would benefit a number of countries."
"This is the distribution of burdens."
"The common programmes help those countries or the areas in which there is a problem, or those countries which have some special need to address the overall problem."
"Similarly, as far as readmission agreements are concerned, I would like to point out, because it was said that Turkey has a readmission agreement with the Union, that it has no readmission agreement with the Union, which is why we said that the Union needs to conclude readmission agreements."
"We therefore decided that there should be a series of criteria for the application of these agreements, because a country cannot cooperate with the Union and refuse to accept the return of immigrants."
"I agree with all those who pointed out that this policy must also continue under the Italian Presidency, because we have taken a step, I believe an important step, but more needs to be done both on asylum and on immigration to complete that step."
"The third issue which I wish to mention concerns the issue relating to Mr Solana's proposal."
"Mr Wurtz commented that this proposal by Mr Solana needs to be debated and we agree entirely."
"Mr Solana has undertaken to process his proposal by December and, of course, afterwards, as with Economic and Monetary Union, so too with security policy, whatever form it takes, and defence policy, we need a broad debate here in Parliament and in the Union."
"I believe that Mr Solana's proposal has much to commend it."
"It does not generalise, it concerns specific issues and correctly identifies the dangers."
"And these dangers arise from weapons of mass destruction, because modern technology allows weapons of mass destruction to be manufactured without the technical means needed in the past."
"Therefore, such weapons can also be made in other countries and prevention is needed."
"Prevention does not necessarily mean that the means for military intervention must exist."
"Prevention for immigration was also what was said, financing for other countries."
"Prevention of terrorism is monitoring these developments, controlling trade, signing agreements governing the provision of information."
"We need prevention."
"We need a policy for this, so that we can stay ahead of such situations."
"Mr Solana has made a proposal, a step, and I believe that we need to continue it, because Greece is convinced from the visits it made, that we need a common defence and security policy."
"Mr Papayannakis said that there is continuity on major problems."
"Of course there is continuity and it has never been maintained that the Greek Presidency resolved all the Union's problems."
"That would be ridiculous."
"In the Balkans, for example, to which one honourable Member referred, both the next Presidency and Greece, now in the capacity of a Member State of the European Union, will need to follow up the solutions found."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, if there is to be a follow-up, we need to talk creatively."
"And I think that the Greek Presidency, as you have confirmed in your comments, gave a creative direction to the approach to the problems."
"Why, what did we want to do?"
"I should like to close by repeating our aspiration."
"We wanted to create a stronger Europe and we followed up the Lisbon policies so that there would, for example, be a stronger Europe in the social and economic sector."
"We wanted the cohesion of Europe, hence our policy on Iraq."
"We wanted prospects for Europe, which is why we worked for the Constitution and the security policy."
"We wanted to make Europe a world power, hence our policy for the Middle East, our policy with Russia, the USA, Japan and Canada."
"I believe that we progressed and we progressed thanks to cooperation with you."
"We progressed thanks to the great help of the European Commission, which submitted a series of proposals, thanks to the contribution made by Mr Prodi, and we also progressed, I believe, because something particularly positive happened during these six months: all the European countries realised that we need to progress."
"We need to create."
"We cannot stay put."
"As long as we stay put, there is an increasing risk of our losing what we already have."
"In order to keep it and to gain even more, we need to progress."
". (IT) Mr President, Prime Minister, I will be very brief, not least because, as you have rightly pointed out in the House, Mr President, you are anxious to move on to new activities."
"There are two points on which I would like to focus, however, for I feel that they are particularly important and supplement the Members' speeches and Prime Minister Simitis' response."
"The first point concerns immigration."
"I have noted that this subject has attracted the attention of a large number of Members of Parliament and I am therefore anxious to stress the long-term principles which the Commission intends to apply in this sensitive, key area."
"Firstly, close, ongoing cooperation with third countries."
"We cannot solve the problem of illegal immigration just by clamping down at this end: that is a sure, confirmed fact and it is the basis of our initiative, but our partners will have to cooperate responsibly in this initiative of ours."
"Secondly, solidarity between Member States."
"This is a problematic point because of the different perceptions, the different attitudes - which the Greek Prime Minister has already highlighted - but we must remember that, after Schengen, the issue of immigration became a European issue, which must be resolved, which can only be resolved in a European context."
"We are an economic area: we have to learn to become an area of freedom and security too - there is no alternative."
"Thirdly, we need to facilitate and simplify legal immigration."
"Europe must continue to be a land which welcomes the stranger, but with strict regard for the law."
"There can be no tolerance of modern-day slave traders."
"Lastly, we must not confuse rigour with inhumanity."
"There must be no deviation from the pursuit of our values of equilibrium and respect: it is a question of civilisation and of European identity."
"My second point is equally brief."
"Mr Wurtz raised the issue - most appropriately, it would appear, seeing as it was picked up on in other speeches - of relations with the United States, foreign policy and Europe's role on the world stage."
"I would like to make just one point in this regard."
"The bilateral meeting with the United States, with President Bush, was extremely interesting and extremely friendly, and both parties outlined their positions clearly."
"I was struck by one aspect, namely that where Europe is able to act in a united fashion - as Mrs Maij-Weggen said in her speech - the United States is ready to listen to us and to follow us."
"I can bear witness to the way Mr Bush was impressed by our account of the economic dimension of the Union, of the number of citizens there will be following enlargement, of the nature of enlargement itself, of the way we have conducted the negotiation process with due regard for democracy - the way we have discussed with each individual country, with all the parliaments, chapter by chapter, the components, the statutes of our democracy, in order to create a genuinely shared democratic vision."
"This has been and continues to be a European vision that nobody can take away from us."
"This is progress."
"It is a way of extending democracy that we can pursue in the world."
"In this regard, we are listened to with great respect, for nobody has ever carried out an experiment of this kind."
"The other thing which has made a lasting impression on President Bush is the role of the euro."
"So many of the issues and questions which we are addressing today derive precisely from the fact that we are starting to see the results, the effects of the euro."
"We expected this but many sceptics did not believe it would happen: the truth is plain to see."
"When, as in the discussion with the United States, I point out that well over half of transactions with Russia and other countries are now carried out in euros - for the euro is a driving force, it can only go on to be used in sectors currently outside its scope such as energy or other sectors because we are being carried that way by the momentum - then Europe is heeded, then Europe is a genuine political entity and not only an economic entity, even though we are talking about purely economic matters."
"Lastly, we were heeded when we outlined the future strategy for the Balkans, to resolve once and for all an issue to the solution of which the United States has contributed greatly, although it stopped when it reached a certain point because it could go no further."
"At that point, Europe has put forward the definitive solution: it has provided the political solution, the solution which brings to a close one of the most serious issues of contemporary history."
"At these times Europe is strong, when it succeeds in making its voice heard, in matters on which we stand united."
"That is why the Convention must take these facts into consideration, promoting majority decision-making in order to give Europe the ability always to speak with one voice."
"It is important that it has become clear and is being accepted - albeit in a light-hearted manner, with a half-smile - that neither the wisdom of Old Europe nor the youthful ardour of the United States is alone sufficient to save world peace: both are necessary."
"That is why, as I see it, the guarantee of peace lies precisely in a strong, close relationship with the United States."
"However, this relationship can only be maintained through dignity and strength, and we have dignity and strength only in those areas where there is no right of veto, in those areas in which we can establish our will, as happens in all other democracies."
"There you are: these are the comments I wanted to make."
"I would like to end by thanking Mr Simitis once again."
"Sophocles' Antigone contains the sentence, '???? ????? ????????'."
"I do not know if my - now hazy - memory of Greek has reproduced it accurately, but it means something very precise: that the exercise of power puts a man's nature to the test."
"Mr President-in-Office - Prime Minister - your nature has passed that test with flying colours."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"I have received 6 motions for resolution on the Greek Presidency under Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)"
"At the recent Thessaloniki Summit, certain very worrying decisions were taken on the process of European integration."
"The most notable of these relate to the Convention and the so-called European constitution, to confirmation of the immigration decisions taken at Seville, which aim to create a 'fortress Europe', and to the maintenance of the monetarist policies of the Stability Pact and of neoliberal objectives for reforming the labour markets and social and health services, as well as for privatising most public services."
"We do not believe that the aforesaid European Constitution can serve as a basis for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for October. This conference represents a fresh qualitative leap forward in the process of integration, consolidating the fundamental bases and strands set out in the Treaty of Maastricht."
"The proposals for altering the European Union's institutional model are completely unacceptable, since they strengthen the federalist nature of its institutions and its domination by the major powers."
"I am thinking especially of proposals to end the rotating presidency of the European Council, to elect a president according to rules which give preeminence to the larger countries, to end the practice of each country having a Commissioner, and to extend qualified majority voting at the expense of the right of veto."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to inform the House that our dear friend and former colleague, Pier Ferdinando Casini, who is now President of the Italian Camera dei Deputati, is in the official gallery."
"We welcome him and look forward to working closely with the Italian Parliament ..."
"...in order to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference under the Italian Presidency is a success."
"We also thank him for the efforts he has made for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"Mr Frans Weisglas, President of the Dutch Upper House, is also in the official gallery."
"He is visiting the European Parliament in order to meet with colleagues."
"We warmly welcome him and wish him every success in his contacts here."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to make a short statement - which I had intended to make yesterday - about events yesterday at Charles de Gaulle Airport."
"I was on a flight from London to Paris with 28 other passengers, including Mrs Lynne and Baroness Nicholson."
"The plane was half an hour late."
"We were then told that, even though there was half an hour until the departure of the Strasbourg flight, we would be transferred to a flight five hours later."
"Some of us decided not to accept this proposal and made our way to the check-in desk for the original flight, which was then closed."
"At that gate I found other colleagues, including Mr Hume, who got the Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with the hard men of Ireland - but they are nothing compared to the ground staff at Paris Charles de Gaulle."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"I then proceeded, because I wanted to talk to the pilot down the ...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
". Mr President, I do not wish to speak until Mr McMillan-Scott has finished saying what he had to say."
"Mr President, I was just about to say that, contrary to some speculation, I was not arrested at this point."
"We have received a number of tributes to my late friend, Mr Dankert."
"He used to chair a small committee of this Parliament, in which I sat, which had as its sole motivation the achievement of the rights of this Parliament to decide where it sits."
"I understand that Mr van Hulten and others are pursuing that work and I want to encourage them."
"We cannot be taken seriously until the Council allows us to decide where we sit and where our staff meets."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, I just wish to say that I was one of the people who tried to take the flight."
"I have always supported Strasbourg and have never voted against sitting here."
"However, I have decided that I really cannot come to Strasbourg any longer."
"None of us should be coming here."
"If Air France cannot get its act together and get Members of the European Parliament to Strasbourg, then we have to decide for ourselves that we meet in Brussels."
"It is not anti-French: it is anti-Air France."
"I am asking Air France to get its act together and the President of Parliament again to appeal to Air France, to appeal to the President of France, and say that, unless something is done, every single Member of the European Parliament will be against meeting in Strasbourg."
"It is just not acceptable to spend at least 12 hours travelling here and miss a whole day's work."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, I understand the frustration of my colleagues."
"It arises from the fact that we are legally obliged to meet in Strasbourg 12 times a year."
"The only way to change that is by a new unanimous decision of the Heads of Government."
"We have perhaps an opportunity with the forthcoming IGC to do that."
"There are a number of written declarations in the register on this subject, which are available for colleagues to sign."
"They are not contradictory."
"I suggest that colleagues who feel strongly about this sign all of them."
"I would draw particular attention to my own one, which envisages compensation for Strasbourg, because we are not going to get Parliament's sittings to Brussels without compensating Strasbourg."
"I think it should be the Heads of Government and the European Council who should travel to Strasbourg four times a year and have their meetings here."
"Mr President, at the part-session here last month I raised this very question of the problems of flying to Strasbourg."
"Yesterday I left home at 7 o'clock in the morning and, because of the behaviour of Air France at Charles de Gaulle, I arrived here at 9 o'clock yesterday evening."
"I could have flown to America and back in the same time!"
"Here is my boarding pass - but Air France would not let me on the aeroplane."
"Nor would they allow nine colleagues on board and, as a result, we had to wait several more hours to get on the next plane."
"Given that this is the European headquarters of the European Parliament one would have thought that every mechanism would be in place to ensure that Members get here."
"That is a primary factor: that Members attend Parliament."
"If the current arrangements prevent us from doing so then they should be investigated."
"Mr President, we Members of Parliament ourselves have adopted numerous provisions on liberalising air transport."
"Any European airline can link any European airport with the city of Strasbourg, so I do not see any reason for criticism."
"The criticism might be justified in this case, but why should it necessarily be Air France which has to link Strasbourg with the other European cities and not British Airways or, I do not know, Alitalia, Iberia or even airlines which are not what are known as national airlines."
"It is true that there is a problem, but we cannot put the blame on a single airline, seeing as we are for the liberalisation of the markets."
"Mr President, a number of Members would have noticed that at the last Strasbourg part-session there were a number of very close votes."
"It is fortunate that Mr McMillan-Scott decided to travel a day before any votes in this particular part-session, because it is my concern and the concern of many of my colleagues that the inadequacies of the transport arrangements to Strasbourg are having a direct impact on who is here to vote on certain subjects and could sway an issue in the vote in this place."
"Once our accession colleagues arrive, this problem is only going to get worse because they have even worse connections to Strasbourg."
"It is obviously an issue that is not going to go away."
"My French colleagues who are going off for their very good lunch now should remember that this Parliament will only legitimise itself when it can choose where it sits."
"I share the rapporteur's position and give my express support to the promotion sought for the proposal for a directive on the adoption and promulgation of best laboratory practices and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances, to be achieved through harmonisation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions. As stated in the Commission's original proposal, it is important that the various Member States adopt common methodologies in this area, as well as common inspection and checking procedures."
"This will facilitate communication between the various operators. It will also improve cooperation between them and opportunities for technical and scientific development."
"Reason dictates that I should agree with the proposal to codify and simplify the relevant legislation."
"I voted with the rapporteur, in favour of adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on the continuing application of schemes approved in 2000 for a supplementary period of four years."
"It is a fact that these schemes, both the LUCAS Project (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey) and the MARS Project (Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing), have contributed to a better understanding of areas and crops in the Community."
"They have contributed to improving measures on land use and land cover, as well as to an understanding of the impact of rural climatic phenomena on harvests and to making yield predictions for the principal crops."
"The extension of these projects should therefore be encouraged because of the good results which have been achieved and presented by the European Commission."
"Mr President, the representatives of the Vlaams Blok and also the Front National have approved this report without necessarily agreeing with Mr Camre."
"The European Parliament must resolutely take the lead in upholding the right of freedom of speech."
"In a democracy, everyone must be free, and have the opportunity, to express their opinion on any subject, even if this opinion is felt by some to be disturbing."
"Freedom of speech applies a priori to the representatives of the people."
"Not only is it their right, it is also their duty to place their electorate's problems and complaints on the political agenda."
"Moreover, parliamentary immunity should be interpreted as broadly as possible, because MPs are not only active in an assembly, but also in the political arena in a broad sense, such as meetings, debates and any possible political and electoral communication."
"Another worrying development is that any criticism of Islam meets with legal and other actions."
"Since the majority of Islamic states are not democracies, it is of particularly great importance that there should continue to be the possibility of debate within Europe on this religion's potentially totalitarian, intolerant and archaic aspects."
". (EL) We are categorically opposed to and we condemn and are fighting against racist and fascist perceptions such as those contained in the statements made by Mr Camre, which are the cause of the request for waiver of his immunity."
"The condemnable statements made by the member in question are intolerable, provocative and humiliating for a large group of religious people."
"However, they were made during the performance of his duties and are part of his political activity."
"Woe betide us if we end up waiving parliamentary immunity, the precise purpose of which is to safeguard the free and unimpeded expression and movement of ideas, when someone expresses views which are contrary to our own political convictions."
"What is the raison d'être of parliaments and Members of Parliament if we deny them freedom of speech in practice?"
"The content and the quality of the ideas expressed by individual Members of Parliament can only be judged by the people who elect them."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn Mr Camre's views, but we vigorously defend freedom of expression and everyone's right to state their opinion freely, even if we radically disagree with it."
"Let us remember what Voltaire said: 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'."
"That is why we are against waiving Mr Camre's immunity."
"I would normally vote against waiving MEPs' immunity in connection with political statements, but I do not have a mandate to allow the European Parliament to block a lawful Danish decision."
"I have voted against the recommendation by the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market not to waive Mr Camre's immunity."
"It is possible to hold many opinions, both for and against the racism paragraph and freedom of expression."
"Every other Danish citizen would, however, want to be brought before a court to have their case tried."
"Even Members of the Danish Parliament would have their immunity waived so that their cases might be tried before the courts."
"The EU enters into agreements whereby ordinary citizens may be extradited to countries other than their own, solely on suspicion. Indeed, we would also extradite our citizens for prosecution in the United States, where the use of the death penalty cannot be ruled out."
"In this situation, I find it completely unprecedented for a Danish parliamentarian to be able, on a relatively innocent matter, to hide behind a majority of the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr Camre is risking neither his life nor his freedom in a matter concerning racist statements."
"At most, he is in danger of the courts' confirming the view taken by ordinary people, namely that his statements go beyond what is acceptable in terms of spreading lies and hatred concerning people from religions other than Mr Camre's own."
"I am voting in favour of its being possible to prosecute Mr Camre in Denmark."
"It is a sound democratic principle that a Danish court should decide whether there has been any breach of Danish law."
"Important objections may be raised to Paragraph 266 b of Danish criminal law (the racism paragraph), but for as long as Paragraph 266 b is a part of Danish law, matters concerning the significance of the racism paragraph must be decided by Danish legal bodies."
"It is a serious warning of the EU's growing power over the Danish legal system that an EU institution should have the power to prevent Danish courts from carrying out those tasks that fall to them under the constitution."
"In line with Mr Chirac and Mr Berlusconi, Mr Camre is hiding behind an anachronistic immunity and thereby significantly helping to undermine the constitutional state that his party chairman nowadays attacks openly."
"I approve of the European Commission's caution regarding the proposed length of the transitional period proposed for all vehicles, because I too consider it excessively long. I must nevertheless congratulate the Council on its unanimous adoption of the common position in question."
"Road safety has to be a top priority, and is becoming a matter of urgency in my country. The type of improvements suggested in the European Commission's proposal must also be introduced."
"Enhancing what car, bus and lorry drivers can see behind them by introducing new technologies which increase the resolution of rear-view mirrors is a measure which must surely deserve all our support and encouragement."
"Madam President, I was present at yesterday's sitting but forgot to sign the attendance register."
"Would you please correct my mistake?"
"Do not worry, Mr Nogueira Román, the correction will be made."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this draft regulation seeks to guarantee a high level of protection for human life and health, animal health and welfare and the interests of the environment and consumers in connection with genetically modified food and feed."
"The high level of protection for human health and also environmental interests is achieved by means of a very demanding authorisation procedure."
"This needs to be said right at the outset, because many Members continue to confuse this with health concerns in connection with the limit value for adventitious and unavoidable contamination that we will be discussing later."
"If I may start with authorisation, the placing on the market of genetically modified food and feed will only be permitted after an independent and stringent assessment of their possible risks to human and animal health as well as to the environment."
"In the future, the assessment will be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, while the authorisation will be granted by the Commission."
"In its first reading, Parliament called for a greater degree of decentralisation."
"We have had only limited success here."
"One point that is important for us, and which has also been taken on board by the Council, provides that the environmental risk assessment for seed will be carried out by the Member States' authorities."
"Turning to labelling, I am very pleased that the consumer-friendly system of labelling genetically modified food and feed has been accepted."
"As you will remember, at this time last year we had a very controversial and also very emotional debate in this House."
"I have been able - and as rapporteur this does of course make me very proud - even in the face of opposition from the largest group in this House, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to gain acceptance for a very consumer-friendly system."
"At this time last year we also discussed the possibility of having a GMO-free label."
"I was and still am strongly opposed to this."
"However, the question no longer arises in the second reading, because it was already answered in the first reading."
"I should simply like to remind you once more that we know from numerous studies and surveys that a majority of European consumers want to know when foods contain genetically modified ingredients."
"A further aspect of this legislation that constitutes significant progress - something that is always forgotten because of the other hotly contested points - is the labelling requirement that is imposed for the first time on genetically modified feed, particularly when you consider that a large proportion of the genetically modified organisms imported by the European Union are used as feed."
"One of the most controversial issues in this debate is the question of thresholds."
"Here too, I should like to correct something at the outset. I know that it will not do any good, because the Members who repeatedly make this claim have already written their speeches, but I should nonetheless like to say this once more."
"This 0.9% threshold does not relate to a conscious use of genetically modified organisms, where people might say, 'it is only labelled above 0.9%'. It is a necessary threshold for technically unavoidable and adventitious contamination."
"In its first reading, Parliament set it at 0.5%, and the Council is now proposing 0.9%."
"At second reading, I have focused on the issue of coexistence, which clearly affects how we are going to retain different forms of agriculture in Europe in the future, but is also directly related to consumer choice."
"I wanted European legislation to be logical; if genetically modified organisms are authorised centrally then the rules for coexistence should also be laid down centrally."
"There was no majority in favour of this."
"The compromise on the table, with which I am very happy, and which nearly all of the groups in this House support and which has also been endorsed by the other European institutions, is very good in my view."
"Through this compromise we give the Member States the possibility of taking appropriate measures to guarantee coexistence and thus also freedom of choice for consumers in the future."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, I would obviously have liked the Member States to be placed under an obligation to do this."
"Unfortunately, the short time available meant that it was not possible to negotiate this."
"I believe, though, that this compromise does put the onus on the Member States not just to sit back and point the finger at Brussels where this important issue is concerned, but also to fulfil their own responsibility in this respect and to protect consumers' freedom of choice."
"I should like to take a few more seconds to thank Members from the other groups for their fruitful cooperation."
". (EL) Madam President, the two regulations we are debating today add to a series of Community legislative acts on genetically modified organisms relating not only to the restricted use, but also to the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment, new foodstuffs and new ingredients and compulsory information on soya seed and genetically modified corn labels."
"These regulations add a panoply of legislative arrangements, with rules on the marketing and sales of food and feed products which consist of, contain or are produced from genetically modified organisms."
"In addition, consumers are given the necessary information, so that they are informed when they want to buy a product."
"Thus, when a product consists of, contains or is produced from genetically modified organisms, the words that this product consists of, contains or is produced from GMOs must be written on the packaging."
"The Council's common position reinforces the proposal for a regulation for which I am acting as rapporteur in connection with the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and products and the traceability of foods and feed, the European Parliament's amendment to Directive 2001/18 and the Commission proposal, particularly those provisions designed to ensure the regulation is implemented more efficiently."
"Thus the Council attempts, mainly on the basis of traceability, to ensure that the market will function smoothly and to achieve a high level of consumer protection in cases where it is not possible to use analytical methods to distinguish between conventional products and products produced from GMOs, in the following ways: introduction of systems to recognise the identity of GMOs by assigning a unique identifier, a requirement for undertakings to transmit information on identity of the product, a requirement for undertakings to retain additional information for at least five years."
"Consequently, I think that the fast adoption of this regulation without proceeding to the conciliation procedure with the Council is what we are asking for."
"If the Council and the Commission accept just certain amendments which, I would say, make traceability and labelling requirements for genetically modified organisms slightly stricter, it will be possible to introduce rules at European level."
"Similarly, as far as the question of mixed crops is concerned, I would like to emphasise that we are talking here of foods and feed, which is why we call on the European Commission to develop guidelines for the coexistence of genetically modified and conventional crops."
"Finally, I think the added amendment concerning the creation of a register for the publication of technical guidelines on sampling and testing for the methods is useful, because this both reinforces transparency and helps to achieve a coordinated approach and efficient implementation of the regulation."
"Fast approval of the regulation in question and of the regulation on genetically modified food and feed will ensure consumers are informed about foods and feed produced from genetically modified organisms, so that they can make an informed choice of products."
"This will result in the lifting of the de facto moratorium on the approval of new GMOs and prevent a trade war with the USA, Canada, Argentina, Egypt and other countries."
"I am basically of the opinion that Europe is lagging behind in these new technologies and in biotechnology, as described in the Council's conclusions and the road map and the significance of this development, with these two reports today and the vote tomorrow, will be considerable for Europe, because we are noticeably lagging behind our competitors as regards this promising technology of the twenty-first century, with adverse consequences at all levels: economic, social and even environmental."
"I therefore propose that we proceed to vote for these amendments, which do not change the substance of the legislative text and, consequently, that we avoid conciliation and that we have these two regulations in force as quickly as possible."
"The problem of being unable to keep up with the speed of developments in biotechnology was what basically resulted in reservations and I think that it is time the European Union moved in a positive way towards this technology."
"That is the intention of these two regulations, so as to give consumers the chance to be informed and the European Union the chance to make progress at last in this technology compared with its competitors."
"I think that we should proceed to vote for a text which is as close as possible to the Council's position."
". Madam President, I am very pleased that we have now reached the final stages of the deliberations on the GM food and feed proposal - which I first presented to you almost two years ago."
"The discussions have been intensive, complex and have often provoked strong emotional reactions and divided opinions."
"It is now important to draw the discussions to a close."
"Allow me to draw your attention to the three principal elements of the proposal."
"First, it will ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health on the basis of a streamlined, efficient and more transparent authorisation procedure."
"Animal feed produced from GMOs will, in future, be subject to authorisation."
"The simplified procedure based on substantial equivalence will be abandoned and authorisations will be limited to a period of 10 years."
"The public will have the opportunity to make comments prior to decisions and to the authorisation of products."
"Second, the proposal provides consumers with what they so overwhelmingly demand - an indication of whether or not food and feed ingredients are produced from GMOs."
"This will provide consumers with the freedom to choose between GM and non-GM products."
"Similarly, feed produced from GMOs will have to be labelled to facilitate the freedom of choice for farmers and other operators dealing with animal feed."
"Third, the proposal increases the legal certainty for operators and traders, which they need to carry out their daily business."
"The common position adopted by the Council in March is both balanced and rational."
"It represents a major step forward in building public confidence in the application of biotechnology to food."
"I am pleased that a compromise package has been tabled to facilitate the final adoption of the proposal."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work towards arriving at this compromise package and for their willingness to ensure a balanced result as well as a timely resolution of the outstanding issues."
"The compromise package includes provisions concerning the issue of coexistence between different forms of agriculture."
"The Commission agrees that this is an important issue for which appropriate solutions need to be devised."
"The Commission would have preferred to address coexistence separately in the context of Commissioner Fischler's current work."
"However, the Commission is prepared to support the compromise package and - as outlined in the package - to develop guidelines on appropriate measures to be taken at national level."
"Such guidelines are on course to be adopted by the Commission later this month."
"To conclude, let me state the Commission's position on the amendments as tabled."
"The Commission can adopt the compromise package, consisting of Amendments Nos 1, 7, 8, 9, and 44 to 48, provided all the other amendments are rejected."
". Madam President, we all know that the GMO issue is a political one as well as a technical one."
"As policy-makers and legislators we have a clear responsibility to provide a high level of safety for European citizens and to enable them to exercise choice."
"The European Union has been building a system that allows us to base decisions on whether or not to authorise the use and release of GM products on the best available scientific and technical advice."
"Once that base is secured it is then a matter of ensuring that the consumer is correctly informed so that he or she is able to choose whether or not to buy GM products."
"The two proposals now being considered in second reading are important parts of the overall design of our system for dealing responsibly with GM products."
"They have been fully debated inside all the political groups and different committees."
"Turning to the proposal for which I am responsible, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the presidency for their efforts to finalise the proposal on labelling and traceability."
"I hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to agree on the amendments to be adopted later in plenary, so that we can reach agreement on both food and feed and traceability in labelling in this part-session."
"This proposal will provide an important complement to the existing regulatory framework."
"You will all be aware of the difficult negotiations leading up to the adoption of the common position."
"The gap between the different positions has narrowed, as many of the amendments adopted at first reading were introduced in the common position."
"As was to be expected, the issue of coexistence has surfaced as the key issue at second reading of both proposals."
"The new Article to be introduced into the directive under the political agreement for the proposal on food and feed will provide for a legal base under which to work."
"This, linked with the forthcoming initiative from the Commission on guidelines for coexistence will provide Member States with the possibility of implementing appropriate measures to deal with coexistence."
"In terms of the key issues, the Commission can support the amendments that provide clarification of the common position."
"These include Amendment Nos 1, 3, 4, 18, 24, 26 and 27, as well as the second part of Amendment No 17, and the first parts of Amendment Nos 8 and 13."
"Conversely, Amendment Nos 22, 23, 25, and 28 seek to introduce texts on coexistence that are identical to that which would be laid down in Directive 2001/18/EC and the regulation on GM food and feed."
"The Commission considers this to be duplication but we could accept it."
"The remaining amendments, the majority of which are retabled from first reading, cannot be supported."
"Amendment Nos 2, 9, 10, 14 and 15 refer to exemptions via thresholds."
"Acceptance of these amendments would undermine the political agreement reached on the proposal on GM food and feed."
"As I have previously said, consistency and coherence between the two proposals must be ensured."
"In addition, the first part of Amendment No 15 seeks to reinstate national provisions for traceability under Directive 2001/18/EC."
"To accept this would only create legal uncertainty, given that the proposal on the table will provide Community rules for traceability as well as labelling."
"Amendment No 7 refers to the 'may contain' clause for food and feed products in the original Commission proposal."
"This was also the subject of a very difficult debate and to reopen it now would have serious consequences for the operability of our system and the forthcoming WTO Panel."
"Amendment No 6, which refers to the definition of the placing on the market, was also subject to considerable debate in the Council, following adoption of the same amendment at first reading."
"The wording of this amendment was included in the common position via reference to the full definition of placing on the market from Directive 2001/18/EC."
"The Commission cannot support further amendment of this definition particularly as the tabled amendment would contradict definitions already laid down in Community legislation."
"Amendment Nos 5 and 29 refer to the precautionary principle."
"I would point out that the Council addressed this amendment in the common position as supported by the Commission."
"The precautionary principle relates to risk assessment which is why it appears in Directive 2001/18/EC and the proposal on GM food and feed."
"Traceability is a facilitating measure, but it is not based on risk assessment."
"To go further than the current wording of the recital is not appropriate and the Commission cannot support these amendments."
"Amendment Nos 11 and 12 refer to traceability and labelling requirements for processed products and acceptance would again impinge on the agreement reached under the proposal on GM food and feed which covers such products."
"The second parts of Amendment Nos 8 and 13 seek to extend the time-period for the holding of traceability information from five years to ten years."
"Even if traceability were still possible after ten years this information would be of no practical value."
"Amendment No 20 addresses the reporting obligations of the Commission, which are duplicated in Amendment No 3."
"Reporting obligations are already reflected in Article 12 of the common position and further requirements are not necessary."
"In terms of coexistence, Amendment No 16 in a similar manner to an amendment on the proposal GM food and feed, seeks to introduce text to address this issue into a new Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC."
"However, the text of Amendment No 16 is not in line with that proposed for this new Article under the political agreement for the proposal on GM food and feed and therefore we cannot accept it."
"Finally, Amendment No 21 refers to the date of application of the regulation."
"It should be noted that the applicability of the regulation was referred to in the Council and Commission statement, accompanying the common position."
"In this regard the Commission points out that Member States have already endorsed a Community format for attribution of unique codes to GMOs based on the OECD format."
"Of course the Commission will make sure that this system is accounted for in terms of new authorisations as required under Directive 2001/18/EC."
"To conclude, it has been a very intensive debate on the whole issue of how the European Union should handle GMOs."
"With some difficulty we have put together a system which will offer security and choice to our citizens."
"I hope that the vote tomorrow will give us a workable compromise and I thank you all for the discussions we have had and for finding a good solution."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the swift entry into force of these proposals for a regulation is a precondition for the final lifting of the de facto moratorium on green genetic engineering, which has been in place for several years."
"It is the current ban on growing and importing GMOs that for years has cut off Europe's scientific community, its consumers and farmers from the positive developments in the field of green genetic engineering."
"Moreover we are facing complaints before the WTO from countries that wish to export genetically modified products to the EU, but may not do so because of the moratorium."
"The USA has already filed a complaint."
"What escapes all of those who want - often for purely ideological reasons - to prevent GMOs from being used here is the fact that genetically modified food and feed have been a reality throughout the world for some considerable time already."
"And particularly where protein feed is concerned we are dependent on imports from third countries, where the growing of genetically modified plants is the order of the day."
"In 2001 the EU imported over 16 million tonnes of soya from the USA and South America: in the USA the proportion of the total soya crop that is GM is 68%; in Argentina it is 100%."
"This is the reality that is facing uncertain consumers and farmers in Europe, as well as a research sector that is unable to plan ahead."
"Consumers and farmers treat green genetic engineering here with suspicion because they do not know what the issues are."
"This is due to a policy of insufficient information, which - at least in my home country of Germany - is entirely intentional."
"We are not making policy to order here."
"Through these draft regulations we need to secure freedom of choice for consumers, and my group as much as any other, Mrs Scheele, is in favour of protecting human health and therefore also in favour of robust consumer protection."
"But with this legislation we also need to cater for agriculture, the environment, small and medium-sized seed producers, industry, the retail food trade and many other branches of industry."
"And we need a labelling requirement so as to be able at long last to assess imports from third countries properly."
"To do so we need to employ reasonable, realistic thresholds, admittedly political thresholds, which are based on what is technically feasible and workable."
"It is a great success, particularly for our group, that all of the other groups are now supporting the Council's common position on the limit values: 0.9% for authorised GMOs and 0.5% for GMOs that are ready for authorisation and in a backlog because of the moratorium."
"The same applies to the decision that this regulation should not include provisions on seed."
"Seed needs its own rules and we cannot have the coexistence issue, that is, the coexistence of genetically modified and conventional plants on agricultural land, being used as a vehicle to place a general blockade on green genetic engineering."
"It was only on this condition that my group agreed to the compromise."
"The Commission is now under an obligation to ensure that the de facto moratorium is not artificially prolonged by some Member States."
"Madam President, I think there is cause for saying a big thank-you to Mrs Scheele for the huge efforts she has made in order to obtain a package and arrive at a compromise."
"It has, I know, in large part been an uphill struggle, with a Council and a large number of Members of this Parliament not having been interested in what might be regarded as the ideal legislation."
"There are still three problems with the outcome, which lead me to think that it cannot be characterised as ideal."
"Firstly, I think that the limit value for labelling in the case of adventitious pollution by GMOs is still too high and, secondly, we are coming, over a period, also to accept adventitious pollution by non-authorised and unlabelled GMOs."
"The third point to which I would draw attention and which I still think is a defect is that we have not obtained the best rules concerning the co-existence of GMOs and other crops."
"There will now most certainly be many instances of GMO pollution, with lengthy compensation cases in their wake."
"If we are not very careful, we are in danger of actually destroying the basis of ecological production and of general agricultural production throughout Europe."
"In spite of these defects, we are in the position of not having any choice, and I too shall therefore support the outcome with which we have been presented, including Mrs Scheele's report."
"The alternative would be far more frightening, namely that of not obtaining any rules at all."
"I believe we are obtaining some sensible rules on traceability."
"In that connection, I hope that Parliament will decide that data concerning transactions involving these products must be kept for ten years, and I also think it important that the results of inspections and controls carried out by the Member States should be kept in a central register so that the best possible data is always available."
"Only time and the first cases of matters going wrong can reveal whether the rules on traceability have been secure enough."
"It is quite crucial for me that the de facto moratorium should only be lifted when the system for developing and assigning unambiguous identifications of GMOs has been fully implemented, that is to say when the rules are in place and there is full traceability from day one. In that connection, I should like to thank Mrs Wallström for the assurances she gave in her speech."
"I hope that European consumers who are as critical and aware as the majority of them appear to be will demand the necessary rules on co-existence from their governments, leading to action being taken nationally and the correct rules on co-existence put in place."
"I also hope, moreover, that this large group of critical consumers will exert a natural restraint upon the demand for these artificially modified foods which consumers have not of course asked for but which chemicals groups and certain European governments definitely want us also to consume."
"Madam President, this issue divides our Member States as it does people across the world, sometimes with an intensity comparable to religious conviction."
"I confess to having no such absolute certainties."
"I am a sceptic rather than an opponent of genetically modified crops."
"I acknowledge that they may bring about benefits in terms of the reduced use of pesticides and herbicides, that there are no proven health risks - or none yet established - and that GM crops could, across the world, be grown in circumstances which would not permit the growth of conventional crops."
"However, I see no certain gains from growing GM products in Europe."
"I believe changes in European and American trade policies are likely to prove of greater benefit to developing nations, and I have fears that we could be making mistakes that will have unforeseen consequences for our environment."
"A common framework of policies is needed if we are to avoid the risk of a trade war with the United States, with appeals to the WTO, and to curb the risk of divisions amongst ourselves across the European Union."
"I await with interest the result of the field trials currently being carried out in my own country, to see whether they provide any evidence on the effects of biodiversity."
"I am pleased to hear that the Commission's proposals for guidelines on the subject of coexistence are on schedule."
"It is vital that these ensure that conventional and organic growers should not lose out as a result of this technology."
"They must be protected from the risk of financial loss, and the proposals here should allow individual Member States to take significant steps to prevent cross-contamination - at least that is the hope."
"There is a strong sense that we are all being driven too fast by narrow commercial interests, mainly concentrated in the United States."
"As a result, I have no doubt that this is an imperfect package and we will have to return to this subject."
"In the meantime consumers must be given the information to make their own choices and, if this ultimately slows the development of this technology while more research is undertaken, then that may be no bad thing."
"Madam President, the labelling of genetically manipulated food and feed is a milestone for consumer protection."
"At long last, consumers will no longer be able to be sold genetically manipulated food under false pretences."
"When, as was the case in Germany, 90% of all genetically manipulated soya products were not labelled, this was tantamount to saying that consumers were incapable of making their own decisions."
"Now, at long last, they are getting freedom of choice."
"Foods such as oil and sugar, up to 100% of which consisted of genetically modified raw materials, finally have to be labelled."
"The products of gene technology must be transparent from the field to the fork."
"The threshold is admittedly too high for our liking, but it counts as a huge success that we are enabling the Member States to take measures to ensure that GM, traditional and organic farming are able to coexist."
"We have also very clearly enshrined the 'polluter pays' principle here; otherwise in the long term freedom of choice would not be guaranteed at all."
"Unfortunately, we in the European Parliament have no influence on the lifting of the moratorium on genetic engineering."
"If the Commission lifts the moratorium under pressure from the USA, labelling will enable consumers to respond with a moratorium on purchases."
"We will move from a political moratorium to a practical moratorium on purchases imposed by consumers."
"The litmus test for the genetic engineering industry is not authorisation but sales."
"Genetically manipulated products will have to maintain their hold on the market."
"I am sure that at the moment no manufacturer will dare to bank on genetic engineering."
"Manufacturers are as afraid of labelling as the devil is of holy water."
"They also know that more than 90% of consumers reject genetically manipulated food."
"We regret the fact that products of animals that have been fed genetically modified feed will not be subject to the labelling requirements, but we are relying on the labelling requirement for animal feed and on the fact that farmers know what consumers want."
"Where seed is concerned too I expect the Commission - and I would ask them to comment on this - not to play any tricks; we really need EU seed legislation with a zero detection limit value."
"Anything else would amount to deceiving the consumer."
"Otherwise, these two regulations would quickly become wastepaper."
"Our expectations here are quite clear: that the Commission should implement this zero detection limit value for seed, because we know that it is possible to have seed with a zero limit value as it is already on the market in Austria and other countries."
"This is not about unavoidable technical uncertainty."
"I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give your views on this once more."
"My final point is that we all know that Bush's claim that the EU is responsible for hunger in Africa was cynical."
"The problem there is not one of technology, but of distribution."
"We also know that these countries are certainly in no position to buy expensive seed from the US genetic engineering industry."
"I therefore hope that tomorrow will indeed mark a milestone for consumers and that consumers will indeed respond to the lifting of the moratorium with a moratorium on purchases."
"Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation of the wearisome work carried out by the rapporteurs, and I am completely serious in saying this, for it has certainly been no mean feat to reconcile positions which were initially so very far apart and achieve the present position, which has backing across the board."
"However, I have to mention the fact that today's consensus is the result of a compromise which is not really particularly satisfactory, adopted purely because of the unyielding reluctance of the Commission and, in particular, the Council, to build a better basis."
"Indeed, the resulting framework certainly cannot be said to be complete."
"That is not so much because the issue continues to be addressed by 35 different reports without even the slightest attempt being made to link them, nor because, for the present phase, it has been decided to split the matter into three different regulations - one of which is not to be debated in this part-session, moreover - as because the framework which emerges is in itself highly dysfunctional, a fact which has been purposefully disregarded in the name of the urgent need to regulate the matter."
"I could cite many examples, such as, for instance, the fact that authorisations are to be valid for ten years and the obligation to keep correspondence and the results of tests carried out for only 15 years."
"In addition, it will be a long time before we have identification codes and the sampling techniques are random, with no standardised procedures, while, what is more, there is the recommendation to monitor the life of GMOs and products produced from GMOs closely, without, however, it being possible to require additional risk assessments."
"There is one example, in particular, which I feel is absurd: so-called co-existence."
"I know there is no point in going back over the arguments raised in the debate on this matter, but the fact is that the path chosen - the decision to require the Member States to produce rules governing the area before the Commission has had time to give its opinion - is surely highly unusual."
"I hope I am wrong when I say that it will not be the benchmarking techniques which stop pollution, in addition to which there is no mention of the 'polluter pays' principle, while, moreover, the acceptability criteria of 0.5 - 0.9, which caused so much debate, are completely invalidated."
"In conclusion, we certainly needed to move on from the current derogations, but that could have been achieved with more meaningful and, above all, more coherent provisions."
"Madam President, in approving proposals on traceability limits for genetically modified organisms in raw materials, all we are doing is to open the floodgates to the gradual but constant release and movement of genetically modified food and feed."
"Our fears are not unfounded, if account is taken of the increasingly suffocating pressure from the USA to import genetically modified products."
"The arrangement setting upper permissible contamination limits creates a de facto situation with which we radically disagree, first because it shifts the responsibility to the consumer, who is not, however, in a position to evaluate the risks inherent in food produced from or containing GMOs and, secondly, because it paves the way for the suffocating dependence of farmers on the mainly American multinational biotechnology companies, which have sole rights to produce and sell genetically modified seed and the agrochemicals that accompany them."
"Apart from anything else, the use of GMOs will result in the genetic erosion of non-genetically modified varieties, with unforeseeable consequences for biodiversity."
"We must fight to ban imports of products made either from genetically modified raw materials or containing GMOs, not for limits on how these products are moved and traced."
"Finally, we disapprove overall of the use of GMOs and the 'could be worse' philosophy."
"Any concession on this position cannot but be at the expense of farming, the equilibrium of the ecosystem and consumer health, which is why we shall abstain from the vote."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, but in particular Mrs Scheele, whose report I followed, for her excellent work and the way she has brought about this compromise agreement on what is a very important report for all our constituents concerning human and animal health and the environment."
"The labelling of all genetically modified food and animal feed will give consumers in Europe what 93% of them are asking for: the choice of whether or not to buy GM products."
"Meat producers, for example, will be able to avoid using GM feed for the first time through labelling."
"It is not complete choice, because of the threshold levels for authorised - and temporarily for unauthorised - GMOs if their presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable."
"These levels are too high, but they can be reviewed in the light of developments in technology."
"Under the new regulations GM food and animal feed will have to go through a strict authorisation procedure - not just a notification process - and once on the market they can be monitored for effects on the environment."
"However, as other colleagues have mentioned, of central importance are the measures which can now be taken by Member States to avoid the contamination of other products by GMOs."
"Coexistence has become a major issue since we started discussions on these reports, and conventional and organic farmers, and food producers, as well as consumers, will welcome the proposals before us today."
"I represent Wales, a country where the National Assembly tried to implement separation distances between GM and non-GM crops, only to be informed by the Commission that this action was not legally sustainable."
"About a quarter of agricultural land in Wales is under agri-environmental schemes, or registered as organic, so this is of crucial importance to the economy as well as to the environment."
"I am sure that my constituents will be very pleased that action can now be taken on coexistence."
"I particularly welcome the fact that it is clear here that producers and users of GMOs must take all necessary measures to prevent contamination of other products so the burden is not on the conventional farmer."
"These new regulations will defend the fundamental principle of consumer choice and we will see people exercising that choice by not growing GM crops and by not buying GM food."
"Madam President, following the approval of the two GMO reports we are debating today, we unfortunately face the imminent cancellation of the moratorium, which is something I deeply regret."
"The EU should not be turned into one large biological exploratorium, as is happening now."
"That being said, 'there is nothing so bad that it is not good for something', as an old Danish proverb would have it."
"Now, there is a further argument for promoting organic farming."
"It is a clear signal to consumers that the only way in which they can be certain of steering clear of GMOs is by buying organic products, especially when you think of all the animal products whose labels will not state whether GMOs were used in the animals' feed."
"The political system has abandoned all responsibility."
"From now on, it is crucial for the GMO-free areas of Europe to be extended through organic farming and for other farmers voluntarily to refrain from using GMOs."
"Madam President, that was a very good example of a French expression of an inferiority complex vis-à-vis America!"
"I, along with the majority of the British Conservative MEPs and the majority of members of my group, see genetic modification as an interesting and potentially very useful development for mankind and for our environment."
"Genetic modification of plants and seeds holds out the possibility of better food production in harsh climates and of assuring future food supplies to a fast-growing world population."
"It also holds out the possibility of reducing artificial agricultural inputs, notably pesticides and herbicides, whose use can cause collateral environmental damage."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has heard no convincing evidence that GM foods are a threat to human health or to biological diversity."
"If we had, we would have been very reluctant to see these proposals adopted at all."
"As it is, this debate has been remarkable for the chorus of Greens, Liberal Democrats and Socialists hymning the prospects of GM foods subject to safeguards."
"Some MEPs may still want to differ from the Council over the question of the thresholds but we should remember here that we are talking about very tiny amounts."
"The text we adopt will specify that GM presence of more than 0.9% of any ingredient will trigger the labelling requirement."
"That is a tiny amount."
"Let us be honest."
"The 0.9% tolerance level is, in itself, on the very margin of detectibility."
"There is something bizarre about Europeans putting in place such requirements when consumers in other parts of the world do not insist on them, when there is no health evidence that supports them, and when we are probably legislating for the technically impossible."
"I have one question for the Commission."
"If this legislation is adopted, and if some countries are reluctant to lift their moratorium on genetically modified foods, what action will it take?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are not debating today whether gene technology has a right to exist in this world."
"Neither are we discussing whether it is right for there to be genetically modified food in the USA, Mexico, Canada or Europe."
"There already is."
"Had we not wanted this, we would have had to take action around twenty years ago and conclude a worldwide agreement."
"We did not do so."
"This means that we now have to ensure that we put a legal framework in place."
"What should the legal framework contain?"
"It needs to state that there is research and that a product shall be completely safe and harmless according to current scientific knowledge."
"What we expect of any food colouring and any emulsifier in yoghurt is also what we expect of genetically modified food and seed, no more and no less."
"We have repeatedly said that it will take a package of measures to assemble a reasonable body of legislation in the European Union."
"The first part was Mr Bowe's report on the release directive several years ago."
"It was always, however, clear to us that this was not enough, that something more was needed in addition to the release of food, seed or plants."
"What is actually needed is for the processed plants to be labelled so that the people of the European Union have freedom of choice, which incidentally they also have in respect of any other foodstuff, for example with the fat content of milk or with other foods."
"They should be able to exercise their right to choose."
"No one has countered what has been said here by saying that genetically modified food is the work of the devil and no one is scaremongering."
"We simply say always that products have to be safe according to current scientific knowledge."
"We are trying to ensure that this is the case."
"And we are trying to ensure that food is comprehensively labelled."
"We have heard that a threshold is arbitrary and we know that this is the case."
"Whether it is 0.5% or 0.9% I really do not care."
"I would like us to have comprehensive legislation as quickly as possible and the reports by Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis are valuable and necessary contributions to achieving this."
"Then we will also have the security in the European Union of being able to say to the Americans and all of the others: yes, you can produce and export to the European Union, but on our conditions and in accordance with our legislation!"
"We owe this to the people of the European Union; that is our job as their elected representatives."
"Madam President, the labelling of food products containing genetically modified organisms is, of course, to be welcomed, because consumers can make up their own minds."
"Whether or not these consumers are right in having doubts about GMOs, the customer is ultimately always right."
"Legislation on labelling, however, to my mind, misses the mark on at least two fundamental counts."
"First of all, the consumer does not get what he wants."
"A consumer who wants GMO-free products does not want less than 0.9% or 0.5% GMOs in them."
"No, he does not want any GMOs at all."
"A non-GMO label would therefore have been much better."
"It is unfortunate that this can no longer be on the agenda, as we rejected it at first reading."
"Moreover, a label of that kind would have made superfluous the whole debate we are now having about co-existence."
"The second problem is that this is about political labelling which goes much further than information of potential relevance to public health."
"As far as I am concerned, paper traceability instead of factual traceability is a mistake."
"It is asking for fraud, and so the next food scandal is already in the making."
"Finally, it is to be hoped that this proposal will lead to a lifting of the GMO moratorium."
"This is what matters most; it means that Europe's lack of knowledge compared to the United States is only growing."
"I should therefore like to ask the same question which Mrs Jackson raised a moment ago, namely whether this proposal will lead to the moratorium actually being lifted, because this is still shrouded in uncertainty."
"Madam President, I am pleased that all the parties and all the groups in this House - including the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - agree on the political compromise that has been reached."
"After all, today's legislation means that the moratorium will be lifted."
"Member States can therefore no longer prescribe their own requirements and ban products off their own bat if GMOs have been tested and approved at European level and meet all safety standards."
"I am also pleased that the Commission will be tabling a proposal shortly in which it will indicate how GMO farming, organic farming and traditional farming can continue to exist side by side."
"I wonder what the proposal will be like, but I assume that sufficient guarantees will be given for traditional and organic farming."
"Madam President, Consumers have the right to know what they eat and to be certain that their food is safe."
"Consumers must be able to choose, and labelling is crucial to this."
"I am not at all happy with the rules that have been laid down, not only in the Environment Council and in the Agriculture Council, but also in our own group."
"After all, traceability has not been factored in as the guiding principle: as modified DNA can be present unintentionally, a margin is provided for."
"We will therefore never be able to say again that something is completely free of modified DNA, which, to my mind, turns freedom of choice into a farce."
"Let me give you two examples: foodstuffs made of GMOs, such as sugar, starch and vegetable oils, fall within the scope of the labelling obligation, while sugar, oil and starch do not contain any protein or DNA."
"Other foodstuffs, however, that have been prepared with a GMO do not fall within the scope of the labelling obligation; these are cheese, wine, beer, soft drinks and last but not least, our daily bread, while bread improvers used to prepare bread contain yeasts or fungi with a GMO."
"These do contain residues of modified DNA in a verifiable manner."
"The distinction drawn is therefore hypocritical and I can understand very easily that industry has difficulty with it."
"I regret it and I hope that in two years' time, thanks to the amendment clause, something better will turn up."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, according to a recent poll conducted by Eurobarometer, over 70% of Europeans do not want to eat GMOs."
"There was, therefore, a need to provide European consumers with a response, by adopting legislation on labelling, which should enable everyone to choose what they eat."
"I do, however, have several reservations."
"The first concerns the 0.9% threshold."
"Why, when a lower presence is technically detectable - with a threshold of 0.5% being accepted for non-authorised GMOs - are we refusing to be less demanding?"
"The situation would be different if a 0.9% presence becomes a reality before the moratorium is even lifted."
"My second reservation concerns consumer choice."
"Will this choice be guaranteed in future, when we do not envisage any binding legislation on the subject of coexistence and instead leave it to Member States to adopt appropriate measures?"
"Perhaps we already know that coexistence is impossible, that we can regulate neither the flight of the bumblebees nor the direction or strength of the wind and that planting GMOs is irreversible?"
"If this is the case, we are taking a considerable risk for Europeans, because we cannot make the issue of GMOs solely one of consumer choice, turning a blind eye to public health and environmental problems."
"Lastly, no one has to date been able to produce powerful, irrefutable and convincing arguments that prove the benefit and the harmless nature of GMOs."
"GMO crops and biotechnologies are too frequently lumped together, but GMOs are only one of biotechnology's many applications."
"Refusing to extend the use of GMOs in Europe does not mean that we are against progress, or against gene therapies; it simply means that we are choosing the precautionary principle over the trial and error of the sorcerer's apprentice."
"Everyone is well aware that what still counts the most in this field is economic and financial interests and that the EU's agricultural and environmental future will be shaped by pressure from the United States and from WTO negotiations."
"This is most regrettable, because it should not be forgotten that the United States has still not ratified the Cartagena protocol."
"I have the feeling that all of these debates and our votes tomorrow are preparing us for agreeing to raise the moratorium without too much argument."
"Our vote will, therefore, be much more political than it appears to be and we would be failing the citizens if we did not demand, before any decision is taken, to be better informed about the real risks that GMO crops will entail for the environment and for people's health."
"Madam President, the proposals in the Scheele report, together with the Trakatellis report, mean that consumers do not have to use GMOs."
"If the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are approved, EU legislation will be the strictest in the world."
"Despite this, the situation is still far from ideal, because it is still possible for traditionally or organically grown plants, and animals, to be adventitiously contaminated by GMO materials."
"We are still waiting for effective criteria for co-existence in the field and also for the environmental liability system that the Commission promised us during the negotiations about Directive 2001/18/EC two years ago."
"Until such time as these criteria have begun to take adequate effect, the ban should not be lifted."
"We must make it clear that European consumers are entitled to decide for themselves whether they want to buy GMOs or not."
"For the protection of this right, we should not have to rely on the World Trade Organisation or the United States administration."
"This is exclusively the responsibility of Europe's own parliamentarians, both here and in the national parliaments."
"If we are to move ahead, we have to support all the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I regret that the Commission has assumed a rather negative position towards a number of these amendments."
"Madam President, I very much agree with what Mrs Ferreira has just said."
"Demand for GM food is not driven by consumers."
"On the contrary, it is driven by - and is only for the benefit of - multinational GM companies."
"The United States' concern for the starving populations of the world is as genuine as George Bush's concern for the Iraqi people's rights."
"By the way, Iraq currently has a GM ban."
"The United States should not be allowed to force this to be changed."
"If the United States and GM multinationals are so concerned about world hunger why do they not put the resources spent on research and PR for GM into helping them fend for themselves, not into forcing them to become even more reliant on multinational companies to grow their own food?"
"They should also stop exploiting them."
"In relation to the coexistence issue, this is a myth."
"Unless crops are grown, harvested, processed, eaten, and even the waste disposed of in laboratories, it is inevitable that there will be contamination."
"What are we going to do in Europe?"
"Are we going to start introducing Schengen agreements for bees, birds and the wind and also ensure that we do not have any kind of cross-pollination?"
"It is absolutely impossible!"
"When we talk about the polluter-pays principle, the multinationals must be held accountable for the fact that conventional farmers, and in particular organic farmers, are not going to be allowed to do what they have done in the past."
"This is all about profit and greed."
"The consumers do not want GM food, so why are we being forced into it just for the benefit of multinational companies?"
"What we have agreed in Parliament, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, does not go far enough."
"The threshold is far too high, since a lower one could be achieved."
"Personally, I believe a zero threshold is the only one acceptable."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what is at issue today is not the profits made by enterprises or conglomerates, but our gaining, at last, the length and breadth of Europe, a single legal framework which will enable genetically-modified foods and feedingstuffs to be authorised, labelled, and traced."
"This will give all participants in the market - including consumers - a guarantee of legal certainty; it may have come very late in the day, but I hope it is not too late."
"In terms of the practical implementation of this technology, we Europeans are over ten years behind developments in other countries, while our researchers are without doubt equal to the best in the world."
"To put it another way, what this amounts to is that research findings have been left unused for ten years, and research in Europe has been scrapped, especially into green genetic engineering, even though the usefulness of this is not a matter of dispute."
"As Mr Davies has given a number of examples of this, I do not need to do likewise."
"Over recent years, however, public discussion has not been about the pros and cons of genetic engineering, but has instead been a campaign mounted along ideological lines, aimed at obstructing a modern and forward-looking technology, so it is not to be wondered at that the results of surveys show the majority regarding genetic engineering as the work of the devil and abominating it."
"A number of interventions in this House today gave me the feeling that the plague was on its way back to Europe."
"We have to be very careful here."
"This situation means that it is perfectly reasonable that the regulations should contain very stringent rules on authorisation, labelling, and traceability, even though these threaten to break the bounds of practical feasibility."
"The reason why I say this is that I think that we, simply by applying very stringent measures, are guaranteeing the absolute maximum of safety that is practically feasible - and this is something that we also need to tell the public over and over again in the information campaign."
"Although the information requirements provided for in the regulations are certainly an important means towards this end, I would like to appeal also to the Commission and say that I too regard Europe-wide information campaigns as necessary, as Mrs Breyer has announced a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products."
"If the labelling of these products results only in their being rejected, we will certainly not be able to catch up on the rest of the world."
"Whilst this compromise motion is certainly an intelligent solution, I do have my doubts - and a number of interventions seem to justify them - as to whether it will succeed."
"When it comes to drawing up guidelines - and I can tell the Commission that I am agog to see what will happen when they do - there will be a lot of hard work to be done; it will not be easy, and I hope it does not turn out to be a bureaucratic monster."
"Madam President, we have to recognise that this is another step in the process of making sure that, when we deal with this new technology, it works for the benefit of human beings and not against them."
"We have seen already other pieces of legislation come before this House, for one of which I was the rapporteur, which were part of the jigsaw creating the total picture of control over genetically modified organisms."
"With this particular piece of legislation we have to recognise a number of things."
"The main objective of this legislation and the agreements around it is to give people the right to make a genuine choice about GM products."
"We have listened to the concerns of people across Europe calling for the right to make an informed choice about GM food."
"We are trying to put in place a labelling and information scheme that makes the choice a reality."
"I have some sympathy with the remarks made by Mr Maaten about the imperfections of this scheme; nevertheless we have to work within the boundaries of what is scientifically provable and practically possible to implement."
"We live in an imperfect world, and the use of thresholds reflects the reality."
"Organic regulations allow for the presence of up to 5% non-organic ingredients."
"In practical terms that means that an organic readymeal could contain minor ingredients like herbs and spices which are not readily available in organic form."
"We do not label very low levels of residues of pesticides or chemical contaminates in foodstuffs although we know they are present."
"In any labelling regime there are bound to be imperfections."
"There has to be a cut-off point where the practical and the scientific reality cuts in."
"That is the best we can do with the science we have."
"One of the ingredients in the pizza that you might eat tonight might be a salami sausage but not every constituent ingredient of that sausage will appear on the pizza-box label."
"Our job is to make the best deal that science allows."
"Our priority has to be to give the consumer real choice."
"Madam President, tomorrow, I will be voting in favour of both reports."
"Nonetheless, labelling will be difficult for industry and will provide no honest information for the consumer."
"In its Common Position, the Council gives it as its opinion that the reports are aimed at preventing the consumer from being misled."
"How kind!"
"The only problem is that it will not work like that."
"The fact is that labels do not have to show any adventitious or technically unavoidable contamination that might be present, at any rate not below a certain threshold value."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt deserves our thanks for making that so marvellously clear."
"Whether the figure is 0.9%, 0.5%, or perhaps we will hit on the idea of 0.1% or even 0.01% - the whole thing is nothing but a load of eyewash."
"If there is no danger to health - and there is none - then what is all the song and dance about?"
"Pity the consumer who will eat GMOs without knowing it, whom we will quite deliberately be misleading."
"Read item 12 of the Scheele report and you realise how worthy of a comedy turn the whole thing is, for it says that, in order for the requirement of labelling to be dispensed with, the operator must certify to the competent authorities that he has done everything possible to prevent genetically modified organisms from being present."
"The good fellow has made such an effort, so we will not put the labels on and keep the consumer informed!"
"The consumer will never discover what he has eaten."
"Never will it dawn on him that he has eaten GM food."
"In the committee, I attempted to prevent this, and put the case for doing away with negative labelling and saying yes to positive labelling."
"That would have been honest, and big firms like Nestlé, Unilever, and others would have gone along with it."
"No doubt it was too late for that."
"Let us treat the whole business as a didactic drama."
"Let us be glad that we have made co-existence possible, let us hope that someone will assume liability for it, and let us take this as a lesson in what political dishonesty can be like!"
"I should like to start by extending warm congratulations to Mrs Scheele, who has handled this difficult dossier with great care."
"I have to say that I have quite a few reservations about this report."
"First of all, I think that labels should tell the whole truth, and not be 0.9% removed from the truth."
"It is regrettable, in my opinion, that we have not decided to introduce a GMO-free label, because that would have made matters much clearer for the consumer."
"I also regret that we have remained caught up in the small-print mentality; it would, in fact, be much better if a label could indicate in an open and clear manner right from the outset whether a product is GMO-free, contains GMO or may contain GMO."
"This would at any rate have provided consumers with the clarity for which many are waiting."
"Despite this, I can agree to this legislation, because I think it is about time the ban was lifted, and I should therefore like to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take to bring this about."
"For the Member States, it is time to closely examine not only co-existence in agriculture, in transport and in ports, but also how this is to be monitored."
"It should not be made too easy to get round this directive, and the Member States should really ensure that it is observed in any event."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for the work they have done, but I have to say that I am very uneasy about the decision we have to take."
"The fact is, I feel as if I am in a kind of hostage situation."
"On the one hand, I want to reject GMO technology, which is far from being problem-free."
"It is no panacea."
"On the contrary, it exposes us to risks because it is impossible to predict the characteristics to which a modified gene may give rise in its new environment."
"Co-existence sounds good, but we also know that GMOs are infectious."
"We do not therefore know what situation we are facing."
"There is also a concentration of power, and the big multinational companies exercise incredible pressure, especially upon the African countries."
"On the other hand, if we cannot put a stop to GMOs, strict rules are naturally needed."
"We must minimise the risk."
"I am therefore going to vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I want, however, to say once and for all that there are so many issues left to solve, for example in connection with environmental liability, that there can be no question of lifting the moratorium."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele have produced a comprehensive piece of work, which should make for better information and greater transparency, as well as helping European consumers to enjoy freedom of choice."
"Consumers have to know what they are buying and what they are eating."
"Effective, reliable legal framework conditions for authorising, labelling and tracing GMOs need to be created as soon as possible."
"Both regulations, along with the lifting of the de facto moratorium on authorisation, are crucial to the implementation of a forward-looking strategy for European biotechnology, demands for which Parliament endorsed at the beginning of this year."
"The moratorium impedes the progress of green biotechnology in the European Union, and, in particular, both damages Europe's innovative SMEs and stands in contradiction to the Lisbon objectives."
"The room for action set out in compromise motion No 1 on the Scheele report is desirable."
"We must, however, ensure that, if individual Member States decide to go their own way, this does not frustrate the aims of this regulation by interfering with the common internal market."
"When it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in non-genetically-modified products, we need rules that work in practice."
"In the final analysis, as we all know, every threshold value we set is arbitrary, but the 0.9% threshold value provided for in the Common Position is reasonable and helps to guide manufacturers and consumers."
"The threshold value is important in terms of different types of cultivation being able to coexist, as, in the natural world, there are no techniques for preventing such things as cross-pollination."
"The most important yardstick by which the new legislation must be judged must be the practicability of its framework conditions, which must, in particular, be in line with WTO rules and must not allow excessive bureaucracy to hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe."
"Above all, they must help to inform consumers and protect them."
"Mr President, although a lot has been said in today's debate about threshold values, and about their being politically arbitrary, I would like to emphasise how important it was for this House, at first reading, to specify a figure of 0.5%, even though many were not happy about it."
"The fact is that, if this figure of 0.5% had not been hammered out and adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we would not have such a rigorous Common Position and also the present basis for negotiating an acceptable compromise on co-existence."
"The second point I would like to address is that I do not think it is very fair for us to be now acting as if we were about to vote 'yes' or 'no' to genetically modified organisms."
"We know for a fact that we do not have the option of saying 'no', whether to GMOs or to many chemicals and other products."
"That is one reason why I campaigned for the most stringent conditions in the authorisation process and for comprehensive labelling."
"Mrs Flemming's criticism was that the method of labelling was politically dishonest."
"I would ask her - although she is no longer here - whether not labelling something that was 100% composed of GMOs would mean that we were being more politically honest with consumers."
"I believe that the European public are perfectly grown-up enough to come to their own opinions on this, and also that biotechnology cannot but become more credible and be taken more seriously if it does not hide behind badly-framed rules on labelling."
"To those who draw attention to their energetic campaigning for labelling as 'GMO-free', I have always said that the fact that products are 'GMO-free' can be indicated by additional labelling."
"We cannot conceal from consumers the fact that genetically-modified organisms are everywhere."
"I believe that we have to stress the fact, and bring it to people's attention, that this stance was friendly only to industry and not to the consumer."
"Mr President, we need new regulation on labelling and traceability and it must be as rigorous as possible."
"But my key point is that even if tough new rules are adopted tomorrow, as we hope, this should not be seen as a green light to lift the de facto moratorium."
"These directives do not address properly the very real risk of contamination of non-GM and organic agriculture with GM varieties."
"Nor do they provide for liability rules to cover farmers who are victims of such contamination."
"Research by the Commission, by the European Environment Agency and by the Department for Environment in my own country all conclude that licensing GM crops will almost inevitably lead to widespread contamination of non-GM crops."
"If we are to ensure that the public has the right to choose to reject GM we must ensure not only that GM is labelled, but also that non-GM continues to exist."
"Unless we can address the problem of contamination, that cannot be guaranteed."
"I do not believe Mr Fischler's guidelines will be adequate."
"The moratorium therefore must stay in place."
"Finally, there are a number of national consultation processes going on in the Member States on GM crops."
"It is vital that those processes are taken seriously."
"It is therefore a matter of much regret that the UK Government's process has been under-funded and badly publicised."
"Its deadline must be extended if we are not to conclude that government ministers have already decided in favour of GM cultivation."
". Mr President, we have now come to the end of this debate that has lasted for very nearly two years at this level of intensity."
"The evidence of the cooperation that has taken place between our institutions is in the presentation of the legislation before you for voting on tomorrow."
"Of course there have been expressions of different views by many sides during the course of the debate over the last two years and, indeed, in this Chamber this afternoon."
"There are some inevitably who will not be satisfied with the legislation that is put forward."
"Some for instance say that we go too far in achieving the balance that we have tried to achieve and that this will put off and set back the development of biotechnology in Europe in the future; that we are losing our good scientists to the United States."
"That may be true but, nonetheless, we have to ensure that we have in place good legislation that gives valuable information to the consumer so that the consumer can make the choice of whether or not to consume GM foods."
"We have put in place in this legislation - the best legislation in the world on this issue - providing free market authorisation, monitoring, labelling and labelling supported by traceability to give it the appropriate level and full credibility."
"Others reject GMOs and I suspect some of them would reject GMOs at any cost."
"I have to tell them that they will never be satisfied and there is no legislation that will satisfy them."
"In those circumstances, have they placed themselves in a situation where their views cannot be fully taken into account?"
"Perhaps that is the case."
"Those who have worked hard on this issue - Mrs Scheele, my own staff and I hope myself - have attempted to achieve a balance so that we get in the legislation the best solution for all points of view, having taken into account views expressed right across the spectrum to achieve the result which is before you this afternoon and for voting on tomorrow."
"I have to say to those who are very sceptical about this technology that all the scientific evidence available to us indicates that GM food is as safe as conventional food."
"There is no scientific evidence going in a contrary direction."
"We have said time and time again that our decisions here in Parliament and in the Commission must be science-based."
"If we move away from that we are in peril."
"I have been asked to deal with the question of the moratorium."
"A number of Member States and a number of others asked for the de facto moratorium to be put in place to enable legislation to be brought forward to achieve what we have in this draft legislation at the moment."
"I cannot believe that it was the intention of those who wanted this work to be done to then say that, despite all this hard work, effort, expense and debate, they nonetheless believe that the moratorium should remain in place."
"In those circumstances, reflecting the views of those who asked us to engage in this exercise and provide this legislation, we have now come to the stage when we must lift the de facto moratorium."
"Legislation is in place which gives adequate protection and information for consumers."
"It is a sophisticated piece of legislation - the best in the world, as I have said - to enable consumers to make the choice for themselves of whether or not to consume GM foods."
"The choice is for them."
"In those circumstances it is appropriate to move now to the beginnings of the lifting of the de facto moratorium on food and feed."
"I do not believe we should be doing this in the face of any threat of WTO proceedings or anything of that nature."
"The work I have been doing - and I am sure it is the same for you - has been done on the basis of trying to achieve what is right, trying to achieve a result that provides the kind of choice for consumers that we believe is necessary and provides the choice for them in a meaningful way and in an informed manner."
"We do this work because we believe it is right."
"We do not do this work because other people believe we ought to speed it up and do what they believe."
"I do not do this work under threat of WTO proceedings."
"To those of you who have expressed scepticism and still have some worries about this legislation, within a period of two years after the adoption of this legislation and it becomes law, there is specific provision in the legislation for a review."
"Therefore, it is possible - and it is intended - for us to return to this issue in that timescale so that we can, with the experience of the operation of the legislation, determine whether there is any need for adjustment and for amendments."
"In my opinion that is an important part of the legislation which will assuage the concerns of those who are expressing anxiety about it."
"Will I take infringement proceedings or do I believe the Commission should take infringement proceedings if there is a failure to comply with the law?"
"It is the Commission's function and role to look to the legislation, ensure that the laws of the European Union are properly applied and implemented and if there is a failure to apply any legislation - including this legislation - then we must take our responsibility and move in the way that we are required to do under the Treaties."
"Finally, I thank Mrs Scheele for her hard work and for the cooperation she has afforded to me in meetings personally and with my staff, and compliment her on the outcome of some difficult work over a long period of time."
"I also enjoyed working with her during that period."
". Mr President, firstly I should like to thank you all for a very useful and comprehensive debate."
"It confirms at the same time how difficult it is to reach some sort of consensus on this complex issue."
"This adds to the merit of the two rapporteurs, Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis, who have managed to approach very distinct positions and to work out some viable compromise solutions."
"In this debate I can trace a wish to be in a different debate about saying 'yes' or 'no' to GMOs."
"This is not the situation."
"We are not discussing whether to say 'yes' or 'no' to GMOs."
"Maybe this would have been easier, but we have passed that stage."
"We already import into the European Union 35 million tonnes of soya every year."
"This is a fact."
"It is not fair to say that we have not tried to act according to the situation."
"We have revised Directive 2001/18/EC about placing live GMOs on the market."
"We have proposed traceability labelling."
"We have looked at food and feed proposals."
"We have added this."
"We have written a new text into the environmental liability proposal."
"We are always discussing ways to complement the existing legislation in order to meet the concerns of citizens in the European Union."
"What we have proposed reflects these concerns and, at the same time, the potential of this new technology."
"This is exactly what it addresses."
"We see that there is probably a lot of potential in using GM techniques, but we also see that there are risks."
"That is why we now have much stricter legislation in place."
"That is why we are tracing and labelling these products."
"That is why we have added a text in the environmental liability proposal."
"This is exactly what we have taken into consideration."
"We are trying to do our part and to take our responsibility."
"That is the only way to address such a complex and difficult issue."
"Is it enough to restart authorisations?"
"This debate also reminds me of a boy I know who, when he was five or six years old, was served small green peas as part of his dinner by his grandmother."
"He assured his grandmother that 'yes, I love green peas, but I don't eat them'."
"The same will apply if we now put in place completely revised legislation but are not willing to apply it."
"What kind of signal are we sending to the rest of the world?"
"A signal that our legislation, which ensures this balance of looking at both the potential benefits and the risks, does not work - we are not ready to apply it."
"That is the main point for me."
"We should be able to start to implement the legislation that we have now worked on for such a long time, trying to ensure an informed choice for the European consumers and farmers."
"We must demonstrate to the rest of the world, including the US, that it works."
"This is how we do it."
"We make a risk assessment, we trace it, we label it and we make sure that we have this correct balance."
"That is why, as my colleague, Mr Byrne, has said, the Commission will take its responsibility."
"As you know, the process also leaves it very much up to Member States to demonstrate that they can work with this issue, but if they are not willing to do it the Commission will certainly take responsibility."
"Once again my thanks go to the rapporteurs and to all in the House for a very exciting debate."
"Mrs Breyer has asked leave to make a personal statement in accordance with Rule 122."
"Mrs Breyer, I would like to point out to you that you may refer only to statements made concerning yourself in the course of the debate. In other words, please can we not have a new debate?"
"Mr President, Mr Schnellhardt has stated that I am organising a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products."
"That is utter nonsense."
"Consumers are making it clear - and saying so in every survey - that they do not want GM products."
"So far, industry has been able to slip GM foods past the consumers on the quiet; now, the food manufacturers have to tell them the truth about their products, so if the de-facto moratorium is lifted, we will be in a completely new situation."
"Labelling has now arrived, so that consumers can make known their feelings - whether for or against - about this type of food."
"For the GM industry, the litmus test is not to do with whether or not they get authorisation from the EU, nor is it the procedural hurdles; it is whether or not consumers will buy these products."
"It is the market that is the litmus test; it is the market that will decide."
"I do not fear the end of this moratorium - far from it."
"You have to ask yourselves why it is that not one single manufacturer has, so far, put these products on the market labelled as such."
"Manufacturers will watch as these products do an economic nosedive."
"If these products have to be labelled, the manufacturers will have to tell the truth about them."
"It is the consumers themselves who will bring in a moratorium on buying them."
"The Commission has also accepted responsibility when it comes to lifting the moratorium."
"Commissioner Wallström, at the time of the directive on release into the environment, you told us that liability would be incorporated in the environmental liability directive, but it was not."
"My final point is that, earlier in the debate, I asked the Commissioner to say something about the rules on seeds."
"My fear is that this House is being tricked."
"I urge the Commission to make a statement about this, because Parliament's voice is not being heard on the subject."
"Will there be a limit value of zero for seeds as is already the practice in a number of states?"
"Is it not technically avoidable?"
"I ask you to speak and account for this."
"Mr President, both these regulations are meant to establish a single new, Europe-wide, legal framework for the authorisation, labelling and traceability of genetically modified food and feedingstuffs."
"Consumers have minds of their own and want to be informed - about ingredients, composition, and additives; some of them want information about methods of production."
"We have to meet this need for information, especially in those areas where ignorance gives rise to fears."
"Consumers want to use choice as a means of getting rid of uncertainty."
"People are afraid of anything that is new."
"As we have no long-term experience of GMOs, information is urgently needed if there is to be freedom of choice."
"I support the compromise."
"If we are to put this important regulation into effect, we now have to avoid a conciliation procedure."
"Only if it is adopted soon will it be possible to end the moratorium, thus avoiding trade disputes with the USA, Canada and Argentina."
"I hope that the EU will shortly abandon its reservations about GMOs."
"If people had opposed the wheel when it was invented, we would still be going everywhere on foot."
"The next item should be the joint debate on a number of reports on food safety, but we would have only three minutes available for it before the start of the debate on the Commission communication."
"There is no point in starting the debate right now."
"The next item is the Commission communication on proposals for action for strengthening the European pharmaceutical industry in the interest of patients."
". Mr President, I am delighted to be able to announce to you that, earlier today, the Commission adopted a communication on the G10 Medicines initiative."
"For those of you who are not familiar with G10, I would like to briefly explain the background to this initiative."
"In recent years there has been growing evidence that the European-based pharmaceutical industry was losing competitiveness compared with its American-based counterparts."
"This is not only serious for our economy but of vital importance to public health and, especially, European patients."
"Millions of Europeans use medicines everyday."
"Achieving real and long-lasting benefits to patients is a key objective of pharmaceutical policy."
"We must support Member States to make authorised medicines, especially the newer and more innovative ones, available and affordable to all those who need them as quickly as possible."
"However, some of the statistics concerning the industry make difficult reading; those pertaining to research and development, for example: critical to our industry, to our science base and to our patients."
"In 1990 Europe was the world leader in pharmaceutical research and development and innovation."
"Now the US has overtaken Europe in the discovery of new chemical or biological entities."
"This has not happened by chance."
"Since 1990, research and development expenditure in the US has grown at a dramatic rate."
"Between 1990 and 2000, research and development expenditure grew at twice the rate in the US compared with Europe."
"By 1997 America had overtaken Europe in terms of total research and development expenditure."
"G10 medicines were born out of this background."
"In recognition of the critical role the industry plays in both the industrial and health sectors, Commissioner Byrne and I established the High Level Group on Innovation and the Provision of Medicines - G10 Medicines."
"It is a small Group of high-level representatives from Member States, industry, mutual health funds and patients."
"The group was given the challenging remit of reaching consensus on ways of improving the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in the context of achieving social and public health objectives."
"To many people's surprise, the group was able to report back in May last year, with 14 wide-ranging recommendations."
"In the communication adopted today we set out how we plan to take these recommendations forward."
"There are five broad themes we pursue in the communication which we intend to take forward in parallel."
"Benefits to patients are at the heart of G10."
"We will look at ways of improving patient information on medicines, strengthening the role of patients in public health decision-making and so forth. I am sure that in that area my colleague Mr Byrne will say more."
"Developing a competitive European-based industry takes us back to the origins of G10."
"We examine ways of improving access to innovative medicines and the need to speed up national negotiations on reimbursement and pricing, greater price competition for medicines that are not part of the state sector and measures to develop competitive generic and non-prescription markets."
"With regard to strengthening the EU Science Base: if we fail to support innovation we will pay a heavy economic, social and public health price."
"We look at ways we can develop incentives for research, including the use of virtual institutes for health to stimulate and organise health and biotechnology research and development."
"We also link in to the many initiatives under the Commission's existing Sixth Framework Programme."
"As for medicines in an enlarged Union, with the forthcoming enlargement the Union is facing one of its greatest challenges and opportunities."
"We look at ways of meeting the challenge through providing a level playing field for intellectual property protection and providing support for the new Member States to implement the new legislative framework."
"As regards Member States learning from each other, benchmarking will provide a practical mechanism for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations, as well as providing a forum for Member States to share best practice."
"So, what is the driving force for implementing the proposals in the communication?"
"The main driving force will be the pharmaceutical review supported by the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan and the Public Health Programme."
"You will be well aware of these, and the Pharmaceutical Review will obviously have its second reading in the autumn."
"However, the unique aspect of G10 is the vehicle it provided to look at areas of national competence that have an impact on competitiveness and public health."
"There is only so much we can achieve at European level."
"In the communication we set out areas where we believe that a European reflection could benefit Member States as well as helping to achieve our G10 goals."
"In particular, we propose an examination of national pricing and reimbursement systems."
"Although this is clearly within the competence of Member States we believe that the injection of more market measures, while ensuring national safeguards to control expenditure on pharmaceuticals, could bring benefits to patients and the industry in terms of quicker access to the markets."
"Overall, I believe the communication, together with the other initiatives I have mentioned, provides a framework for turning around the competitiveness of our pharmaceutical industry while reinforcing European public health."
". Mr President, in the G10 communication adopted today by the Commission we see patients and public health placed at the centre of the debate on the future direction of European pharmaceuticals policy."
"This rebalancing of policy-making between legitimate industrial innovation and health needs is an important step in the right direction."
"You have previously heard me say here that our health is our wealth."
"The development of rising public health standards, the extension of disease-free life-years and the increase in life expectancy are shaping features of modern economic development, and pharmaceutical innovation has played a significant role in all of this."
"Similarly, from a patient point of view, innovation has yielded dramatic improvements in the dignity and quality of life of patients in recent decades."
"Now patients are taking a more active role in seeking out information and products."
"But at a point where health expenditure is rising, the population is ageing and patients' expectations are increasing, we need to have a strategic vision of how to move forward in this complex field."
"There are a number of interlinked issues here."
"For patients, there is a desire to have more effective, more humane products, brought to market more quickly."
"There is a desire to have better information on the comparative advantages of products and early warning of adverse reactions."
"For patients, the availability of clear and authoritative information from the leaflet inside the package, to online at the level of a European health portal, is essential."
"For those who finance the health system, there is a need for sustainable budgeting, affordable medicines, manageable demand and responsible behaviour from patients, prescribers and producers alike."
"From a public health point of view there is a need to ensure that medicines maintain high quality and safety standards and that adverse reactions are quickly identified and tackled."
"There is a need to work towards more rational prescribing and consumption patterns, to ensure that we can tackle anti-microbial resistance."
"In addition there is a need to ensure that research develops products which tackle health requirements as distinct from lifestyle issues."
"For example, more must be done to develop products that tackle rare diseases and childhood illnesses."
"And, in an ageing society, medicines will play an important role in ensuring active and healthy ageing - with all its attendant economic and human benefits."
"For the industries involved, there are a range of specific issues which are being presented to you today."
"But we need to be aware that an increasingly global industry is less likely to prioritise investment in research for the treatments which Europeans will need in 10-20 years' time if they are dealing with a fragmented and unpredictable market."
"In other words, whilst there will be no shortage of sure-fire lifestyle wonder drugs like Viagra, how can we be sure that the medicines needed to tackle arthritis, Alzheimer's and obesity, to name but a few, will be developed?"
"It is only by moving towards a more predictable market environment across Europe that we will be in a position to convince industry to take the needs of Europeans seriously in the years ahead."
"The High Level Committee on Health has stated that the public health goal of pharmaceuticals policy is 'to make readily accessible, efficacious, high quality and safe medicines, including their most recent innovative ones, to all those who need them, regardless of income or social status'."
"Each of these issues has been addressed in this communication."
"We have effectively highlighted patients' needs for better information and their need for a stronger voice to influence policy."
"Efforts in both these areas will support their growing role as important decision-makers for health care."
"The establishment of an EU-funded European Patients' Platform in February this year is an important step."
"We have also targeted the medicines themselves, to build up systems that ensure their safety, quality and efficacy."
"Here the G10 put the need for stronger systems of pharmacovigilance and relative effectiveness firmly on the agenda."
"In this way we aim to improve the rational use of medicines."
"This is a public health goal that underpins our vision for the pharmaceuticals sector."
"Relative effectiveness is a very important issue for the European Union."
"In June 2000 the Council underlined the importance of added therapeutic value both in terms of health protection and from an industrial policy perspective."
"Effective medicines must get quickly to the people who need them."
"This means identifying which medicines are genuinely effective, not just in the controlled environment of a clinical trial, but in general use amongst the wider population."
"This is the critical issue at stake here."
"Relative effectiveness is one key tool towards rational use."
"But, clearly, we have to consider the role of other actors too."
"How can we improve rational use of pharmaceuticals at the level of the health care prescriber and the consumer?"
"A parallel question might be: how can we know if we have improved the rational use of pharmaceuticals?"
"This brings me to the issue of benchmarking."
"The recommendation to develop indicators for public health has set us a big challenge."
"For example, to investigate indicators that could monitor what is happening at the health-care prescriber level."
"Ultimately, the intention is to have a set of indicators that can shed light on what is happening in the pharmaceuticals sector of Member States in terms of the extent to which public health needs are being met and in this way to inform policy development at national and European level."
"Finally, the discussion on enlargement is particularly timely."
"The accession treaties have been signed."
"Although enlargement is one specific recommendation of the G10, clearly our responses to each recommendation need to adequately reflect the changing environment within the European Union."
"The G10 is a first important step to developing a strategic vision of the future health needs of Europeans which is affordable, effective, transparent, inclusive and safe."
"Properly pursued it will be good for the health of all concerned."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"This debate will be conducted according to what we call the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt has succeeded in catching my eye, and she has the floor."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to be able to catch your eye."
"I have just one question for the Commissioners."
"Do you not think that there is a certain contradiction inherent in the recommendations?"
"If you are in favour of more incentives for research in order to get better medicines to the patients more quickly, and if all the G10 countries have said so too, then why does it appear from the policy agreement on the pharmaceuticals package as if the provision being made for data protection, as regards the creation of a return on innovations, is insufficiently long-term, so that research is not being driven forward?"
"Do you not also think that the safest and best way of providing patients quickly with better medicines would, in principle, be a fast and simple central procedure, and that it would be better if the Commission and the Member States were to hand out more money for research projects and at last get round to submitting the new legislation on children's medicines to Parliament?"
"That would enable us to do something more quickly about getting people better medicines."
". Mr President, I must emphasise that the two proposals are separate as far as the review is concerned."
"The review is supported by G10 and now has the support of the Member States."
"The G10 process goes further, and so far there has not been any broad discussion in the Member States about that."
"There is, firstly, a proposal from the Group and today there are the recommendations from the Commission."
"Next week the Italian Presidency is organising a conference on G10 on the basis of the Commission recommendations."
"We hope that the dissemination of these messages goes forward."
"As I said, it is now important to get the review through."
"That is important for research-based industries because it strengthens their position; it accelerates the access to markets for new products; it acts as a counterbalance; and it also means that generics will be more competitive when the patents expire."
"Mr President, having worked for over thirty years for one of the major international pharmaceutical companies, I can tell you that the main concern of this industry, whether European or otherwise, is neither people's health - and especially not the health of people who cannot afford to pay for their medicines - nor the well-being of its employees, whom it does not hesitate to make redundant by the thousand whenever a merger or concentration takes place in the sector or to drive hard, day and night, even the women, in manufacturing and packing medicines."
"These practices are all the more scandalous because the pharmaceuticals industry is one of the most profitable of all."
"The sole concern of this industry is the financial well-being of its shareholders."
"Before bringing out a new medicine, the major companies first undertake marketing studies, which determine whether research in the field is continued or stopped."
"This means that companies are only interested in illnesses that generate money."
"Too bad if a growing number of men and women find it harder and harder to look after themselves; too bad if in Africa and elsewhere, children are still dying in this day and age of easily curable diseases such as measles, and too bad for those people suffering from malaria or other diseases that affect the populations of poor countries."
"The only decision that could satisfy both the employees of these companies and patients - in rich countries and in the developing world - would be for this industry no longer to be a private industry in which only the interests of a minority count, and for it to be placed under the control of the people, for the benefit of everyone."
"Thank you, Mrs Bordes."
"Let me just point out that, in a debate of the sort we are having at the moment, the idea is to put questions rather than just make speeches."
"I would ask you to again read the Rules of Procedure in order to see just how this works."
"That way, there will be no misunderstandings between us next time."
"Mr President, I must admit that I am pleased to hear Mr Byrne side with consumers against the pharmaceutical industry."
"We had the feeling, when addressing the pharmaceutical industry dossier and pharmaceutical legislation at the same time, that it was actually the European Parliament that was defending consumers, through far-reaching amendments, in particular on marketing authorisations, on centralised procedure and on consumer protection."
"The Commission's answers to these questions, let us remember, were not what the European Parliament had hoped to hear."
"Fortunately, I have the impression today that the Council has reintroduced a number of items, such as the five-year renewal, marketing authorisations, the centralised procedure and stopping direct advertising to patients."
"All of this leads me to ask you whether your communication will accept a good number of the amendments to pharmaceutical legislation that Parliament has adopted by a large majority, particularly in the fields of direct advertising, consumer participation in the EMEA, centralised procedure and modifying marketing authorisation dossiers, as real proof of your concern to protect consumers and patients?"
". Mr President, that discussion has already been held in a different context when I commented on Parliament's amendments, but I would like to say briefly that the Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the centralised procedure."
"We now we propose that it be applied for all active substances and Parliament supported this."
"Now the Council has reached a political agreement which goes in the same direction, but in a rather narrower fashion."
"It will limit the application of the centralised procedure to four illnesses, but within the legislation, in the Council's opinion, there should be a particular Article which would allow for the enlargement of the scope of the centralised procedure."
"Regarding information for patients in that area, discussions continue but it seems to be that the majority in the Council and the majority in Parliament are not so far from each other."
"This is not the same as the Commission's position, but I respect the outcome of the legislative procedure."
"The Commission has never proposed direct-to-consumer advertising."
"It only supports the provision of controlled information for patients, patient groups and so on."
"Anyone who today has access to the Internet sees a massive amount of direct spam advertising on medicines, which is growing every day."
"It would be better for consumers if they knew which websites were trustworthy, where there is scrutiny by the authorities or whether they could trust the quality of the information."
"On that issue, it seems that Parliament and Council are on the same wavelength in being very prudent on the issue of information for patients."
"We will of course return to this in second reading."
"Commissioners, among your numerous proposals, you referred to the added value of medicines."
"I believe that this is a crucial point."
"A large number of new medicines now coming onto the market are, unfortunately, rarely innovative."
"What practical measures do you envisage for encouraging industry to produce not only new but also innovative medicines?"
"You also raised the issue of the European computer portal."
"New Zealand, for whom I have appointed myself spokesperson, is currently working on just such a system and wonders whether our contribution to this system will be medicine-centred or disease-centred and, in the latter case, whether the answers provided will revolve around medicinal therapy or whether other, replacement therapies will be proposed on these sites."
". Mr President, in reply to the first question, if there is real work on the new indications, which really means new innovations, then supplementary protection data exclusivity can be guaranteed."
"As far as efficiency factors are concerned, our position is that authorisation should be science-based but of course, once the authorities of the Member States decide which medicines they reimburse by public funds, they can reinforce that by different studies of their efficiency and that is supported also by G10."
"In that area G10 is proposing, and the Commission is supporting that proposal, that more exchanges of information on best practice and these kinds of efficiency studies could be undertaken in future."
"Regarding the second question, of course it is very much in the hands of Member States."
"There is very different legislation in Member States, whereby patients are being directed to use different solutions, either only the product which traditionally has been under patent or at the same time generics, when generics are inside the market."
"On the European level perhaps the emphasis is not there; it should be more on the national level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the pharmaceutical industry is not doing all that well."
"There is a lack of innovation."
"That is why there is the temptation to provide better protection for existing products or produce minor variations on them, and prices remain unacceptably high."
"Your communication is therefore very well-timed."
"You were both right in saying that the patient must be placed at the centre of the debate, but the question is, of course, who that patient is."
"As one of the previous speakers already remarked, patients in developing countries are still faced with a shortage of medicines."
"In actual fact, no, or hardly any, research is being done into diseases of the developing countries."
"I would therefore want to ask you what initiatives you intend to take in order to give research into the neglected diseases a shot in the arm, so much so that the pharmaceutical industry as a whole will also enjoy the benefits."
"Mr President, as far as the developing countries are concerned, there are three main possibilities in terms of action: firstly, to create a legislative framework that encourages research on orphan drugs to treat what are on our territories rare diseases."
"There, we have a directive that was adopted by Parliament some time ago, and that framework is in place."
"Secondly, the question is that if that is not enough to provide an incentive for research work, the question of public research funding can be raised."
"I am sorry that Mr Busquin, the Commissioner for Research, is not here."
"I am sure he would be in a position to provide a more detailed reply to that."
"Thirdly, there are the issues of the needs of developing countries, which are based on the low level of income and lower purchasing power of the citizens."
"In that area, there has been some progress in recent years."
"The issue is still being discussed in the WTO context on the one hand."
"On the other, there have been schemes which have allowed developing countries to purchase certain medicines at a lower price than in Europe."
"Things are moving, but I am sure that the situation today is far from satisfactory."
". Mr President, I would like to add briefly to what Commissioner Liikanen has just said in answer to that question."
"There is a group of Commissioners which includes myself, the Commissioner for Development, the Commissioner for Trade and the Commissioner for Research."
"This group is concerned with the very issue you are talking about, that is, to focus on diseases in the developing world."
"This group is focusing in particular on the diseases of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis."
"I expect that more information will be made available on that issue as time passes."
"I would also mention that one of the objectives that has been stated by the Italian Presidency, by the incoming minister for health, is to make progress on the disease of malaria."
"That is one of the objectives of the Italian Presidency."
"Mr President, Commissioners, I wish to take up the thrust of the speech by Mrs Corbey, with whom I worked on drawing up a programme under Article 169 of the EC Treaty relating to the Sixth Framework Programme, for Research and Development on diseases prevalent in the countries of the southern hemisphere."
"She asked you about the difficulty of attracting researchers to this field."
"You replied that Commissioner Busquin could have given us further answers on the matter."
"Without wishing to put words into the Commissioner's mouth, I simply wish to say that there appears to be very little enthusiasm in the private sector for contributing to the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme I have just referred to, under Article 169."
"Since you work together, you might perhaps know about this: could you confirm or deny the information that I have in this field concerning the lack of private funds raised to implement this programme to combat Aids, malaria and tuberculosis?"
"Do you also have information about whether States have agreed to this programme and consequently whether public funds are being harnessed?"
"Since the European Parliament voted for this report at first reading, we have not had much news."
"This question stretches the scope of today's debate, but it involves the same issues and, this being the case, I would be extremely grateful for any answer you might be able to give me."
". Mr President, the work that is being undertaken on this issue, by the Commissioners involved, is ongoing, as I indicated earlier."
"It is hoped that there will be greater involvement of the private sector in this issue, because we have ambitions to make some progress on that."
"I also know from the work that has been undertaken by Commissioner Lamy in relation to the provision of drugs to developing countries that this is an issue that is being discussed in the context of the Doha Round."
"He has expectations that there will be progress on this issue because it was one of the undertakings that was given in Doha at the commencement of the discussions."
"The expectation is that developing countries will insist on some progress before there is any finality."
"I expect and hope there will be some outcome on this before Cancun."
"I will confine myself merely to asking Commissioner Liikanen a few questions. At the start of his speech, he drew our attention to the state of the European pharmaceutical industry, pointing out that it is less competitive than it once was and that, although it is one of the most important industries in Europe, it has now lost its pre-eminence to the United States."
"I would like, then, to make a short comment to the effect that the future of Europe - Europe's destiny - is being determined today above all in its laboratories and research centres."
"That is why Commissioner Liikanen's observation left me troubled, more troubled than I already was. So I would ask him this: might the legislative framework under development in Europe and the inflexible system of research regulations in the field of biotechnology, for example, not constitute a major obstacle to European industry's acquiring or recovering competitiveness?"
"I know that this is not what many of my fellow Members wish to hear, who, for philosophical or ideological reasons, are imposing a virtual veto on biotech development, but I felt obliged to put this question to you, Commissioner."
". I should just like to say a word about the pending research."
"Public research is very important but it is very clear that, even in the EU, objectives of devoting 3% of GDP to research by 2010 is based on the concept that 1% of GDP would come from public sources, 2% of GDP would come from the private sector."
"Whatever happens in public spending, we never will have enough resources to achieve 3%."
"For that reason, the regulatory framework has to be judged so that intellectual property rights are protected in such a way that private money will go to the sector."
"Whether you like it or not, that is very simple, clear economic logic."
"On biotechnology, I am sure you are at least partly right."
"In the Commission we have accepted the biotechnology action plan, which we follow in a strict way."
"In general in the field of so-called 'red biotechnology', which is connected to pharmaceutical industries, perhaps the situation is slightly better."
"When you go to the other branches of biotechnological research we have a lot of work to do."
"Today my colleagues Mr Byrne and Mrs Wallström talked about the GMO area."
"There are also other issues in this field."
"If we want to lead in the field of pharmaceutical research we cannot separate different chapters of biotechnological research."
"We need intellectual property rights, we need sufficient financing."
"We also need public opinion that supports novelties and innovation in the market."
"At the end of the day that is always critical."
"No research can have financing unless there is a market."
"There is no market unless consumers have confidence in the products that come out of research and manufacturing."
"Mr President, I wanted to ask a brief question about the European Patients' Platform and to ask the two Commissioners whether they are happy about the degree of independence of those who represent patients."
"I do so against the background of articles published in the British Medical Journal in the United Kingdom."
"If the Commissioners have not had sight of these articles I would be happy to let them have them."
"We all understand that without the support of the pharmaceuticals industry there would be very few patients' voices, but that voice does not come without a price."
"I would be interested in your views on that."
". Mr President, as Mrs Read said, it is of absolute critical importance that the platform is seen to be, and is, independent and does its work in a manner that is going to add value to this entire issue."
"I have not heard any suggestions that there is any infirmity in this area."
"I take note of what you say in relation to that issue and will enquire about it personally when I leave the Chamber."
"However, I have to assure you that I have not heard this, I do not have those apprehensions and I have confidence in the platform."
"Question No 31 by Carlos Lage (H-0393/03):"
"Subject: Reform of the common fisheries policy and the stability principle"
"During the European Parliament's debate and vote on the reform of the common fisheries policy, much support was expressed for the principle of relative stability in the management of fisheries resources - a principle which is doubly advantageous since, on the one hand, it will help to ensure that resources are better managed and conserved (which is one of the main objectives of the reform) and, on the other, it will prevent undesirable conflicts which impede the development of harmonious relations between fishing peoples and communities."
"This is what is happening today, for example, all along the Portuguese coast, where people are becoming increasingly concerned and are rebelling against the EU authorities."
"What action is the Commission intending to take in order to secure acceptance of the above principle and thereby reassure fishermen and the general public?"
"."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lage's question addresses the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, which features in the Council's consideration of the new regime applicable to Western waters."
"The Commission's task in this is to ensure that two principles are maintained, the first being the principle of relative stability, which is laid down in Article 20 of the new framework regulation for the common fisheries policy."
"This principle, according to which fishing opportunities are to be shared out among the Member States, applies, of course, to Portugal and to Portuguese waters."
"Another principle in the common fisheries policy, in addition to this one, is that of free access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, which is laid down in Article 17 of the new framework regulation, and which is of fundamental importance."
"When dealing with the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, the Commission clearly has to adopt the same approach as it does to all other Community waters."
"Although all Member States have to have access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, this access can be restricted on biological grounds, but restrictions of this sort must not be discriminatory in their effects."
"For that reason, it is not possible in law to protect fish stocks by denying fishermen from a neighbouring country access to these waters."
"There is a solution, however, and the right one is to have relative stability, together with total allowable catches, quotas for stocks of economic importance, and any further technical measures that may prove necessary."
"Thank you for your response, Commissioner."
"That was a formal response based on principles, the principle of relative stability and the principle of freedom of access. There is a certain contradiction implied between these principles, although commenting on this is irrelevant at present."
"This formal and abstract framework does, however, conflict with a situation that cannot be ignored at either the political or ethical levels."
"I am referring to the fact that Portuguese territorial waters have the misfortune to lie next to the territorial waters of Spain, which owns the largest fishing fleet in Europe, one which hungers to find new fishing grounds and shows a ravenous appetite, not always adhering strictly to the rules."
"This is causing fury among Portuguese fishermen, as well as great anxiety and indignation in Portuguese public opinion, so much so that all the reactionaries and nationalists in the country, who have been keeping quiet because the European project is a success for both Europe and Portugal, are taking advantage of the situation. They are making irate speeches against a Europe which wants to deprive Portuguese fishermen of their fish and allow uncontrolled and alien fishing in Portuguese waters."
"This is a political problem which the Commissioner and the Union have to face."
"."
"(DE) Mr President, I am aware that various sections of Portuguese society have reacted in this way, but you will also understand that the only option open to us is that of acting within the legal framework available to us."
"I have told you that there is a solution in practical terms, above all if the Spanish and the Portuguese are willing to meet each other halfway when quotas are laid down."
"What is actually at issue, and of the essence, here is sardine fishery, for which, in this stretch of sea, no quota has been set up until now."
"We are, however, prepared to set such a quota, and it stands to reason that, when this is done, it will be possible to specify how much of this quota is to be fished by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen respectively."
"We would then have a solution that would, I believe, be acceptable to everyone."
"Question No 32 by Proinsias De Rossa (H-0405/03):"
"Subject: EU support for the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour"
"On 13 June 2002, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on child labour in the production of sports equipment which, inter alia, called for more funds to be made available to the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (Paragraph 9)."
"In the light of this resolution and of the Commission's answer to my Oral Question (H-0515/02"
". Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns expressed about the use of child labour in general and, particularly, in the production of sports equipment."
"The Commission is establishing a strategic partnership with the ILO as a follow-up to the communication on building an effective partnership with the United Nations in the fields of development and humanitarian affairs and the communication on promoting core labour standards and social governance."
"In that context, careful attention will be given to possible support for the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour."
"Annual high-level meetings between the Commission and the ILO are held in the framework of the cooperation between the two organisations agreed in May 2001."
"The next high-level meeting will take place on 8 July 2003 - a week from now."
"The Community is increasing its support for universal and compulsory primary education in all developing countries."
"It sees this as one of the most efficient means currently at its disposal to draw children out of the vicious circle of exploitation."
"We place great emphasis on working with the ILO on this issue, both because of the problem of child labour as such, and because this is an area in which most people understand the whole rationale of strengthening governance and the rights that the ILO is working for."
"I wish to thank Commissioner Nielson for his reply."
"I am pleased that steps are being taken by the Commissioner to follow up on the commitments already made, and look forward to the outcome of the meeting on 8 July."
"The global statistics for the involvement of children in labour are really astonishing, particularly when you see the breakdown, where it is estimated that something like two million children globally are involved in prostitution and pornography and approximately six million children are in bonded or forced labour."
"The global figure is something close to 200 million for child labour."
"Could the Commissioner indicate in what way we can hope to measure the success of the ILO and the European Union's efforts in this area? In addition, could he indicate how we can discourage the major sports companies which sell sports shoes and clothing at inflated prices in European stores?"
"How can we avoid the situation that, when they come under pressure in India, they move to China to carry on exactly the same trade?"
". This has to be focused on in all parts of the world."
"The main side here is as criminal as the production side."
"Very little is decided in these activities without being defined by the market in our rich part of the world."
"There is the 'Red Card to Child Labour' action being taken by FIFA and the ILO to jointly combat child labour, a very good campaign that directly addresses exactly the problem we are talking about here."
"Matching this with the broader work of increasing respect for the basic principles that the ILO stands for will, I hope, make a difference."
"The measurement of progress here can be made in many ways."
"One is to see how many countries actually sign up to the legal instruments."
"This debate is one that we are pushing quite vigorously with our development partners."
"Question No 33 by Camilo Nogueira Román (H-0356/03):"
"Subject: The association between Mercosur and the European Union in the light of the new political situation in Brazil and Argentina."
"Economic relations with both countries"
"What stage has been reached in the planned association between the European Union and Mercosur six months after the election of Luís Inácio Lula da Silva as President of Brazil and now that Argentina has elected Nestor Kirchner as its new President, bearing in mind that both leaders have clearly signalled their intention to develop relations between the two countries further and to give Mercosur a fresh impetus?"
"In this context, can it say what the state of economic relations between the Union and these two countries is?"
"Mr President, Mr Nogueira Román's question raises three points."
"First, the state of the negotiations between the Union and Mercosur; secondly, the effect of Mr Kirchner's election as President of Argentina and, lastly, issues of economic cooperation between the Union and Mercosur to facilitate integration in that region."
"Let us look first at the state of the negotiations."
"As you know, we relaunched the process last year and, since then, negotiators on both sides have been working relentlessly to make progress on its various aspects."
"These are complex negotiations, which address services and regulations and the trade in goods."
"Last year in Rio, we therefore adopted a schedule and we are sticking to it."
"Proposals on tariffs, which were furthermore of a high quality, were exchanged."
"Since March of this year, the pace has been relaxed."
"Some progress has also been made on rules of origin, investments, tenders, dispute settlement, trade facilitation, standardisation and technical regulation."
"This all bodes well."
"The March negotiations also enabled us to prepare an exchange of ideas on services, investment and on procurement contracts, which took place at the end of May, although we were rather disappointed with the proposals put forward by our Mercosur partners."
"As you see, we are still actively pursuing these negotiations and we have confidence in our partners' desire to get there."
"One negotiating round was concluded last week in Asunción."
"We must continue to make progress because much remains to be done, not least because our friends in Mercosur are anxious for the Union to make a gesture."
"We will only make such a gesture, should this prove necessary, in the context of an overall balance, which has not yet been fully achieved."
"Optimism about the state of the negotiations must, therefore, be relative."
"It is probably premature at this stage to take the decision on launching the final phase of negotiations - always an important time - because there are many issues involved and this takes time."
"We are considering this step, particularly because these negotiations - especially in the field of agriculture - cannot be separated, in terms of a bargaining chip for the EU, from what is happening in the multilateral context of the World Trade Organisation."
"We look favourably on Mr Kirchner's election as President of Argentina and on the various statements by Presidents Lula and Kirchner on the future of Mercosur."
"Both of these undoubtedly wanted to convey to Mercosur, in other words Paraguay and Uruguay, to Latin America and more generally, to the entire world, their desire and their will to strengthen the process of integrating Mercosur."
"We can only welcome these statements."
"Latin American integration is one of the European Union's political priorities and this is why we initially felt that we should negotiate with Mercosur as a whole."
"We therefore wish to hold 'one-on-one' negotiations and not 'one-on-four' as is done in other areas such as the North-South America free trade zone."
"I have also said, moreover, and have said so publicly to our partners in Mercosur, that the EU's trade ambitions towards Mercosur are in line with Mercosur's own ambition in the field of political, economic and commercial integration."
"What means, then, are we making available to Mercosur under economic cooperation?"
"There is first of all our action at regional level: we have a regional Mercosur/European Union strategy on contributing to the completion of Mercosur's internal market and, for the 2000-2006 period, this amounts to just over EUR one million."
"We are committing more than EUR 10 million in the same period to Mercosur's institutionalisation and there is a third chapter of assistance for civil society."
"Our experience as Europeans enables us to contribute to the completion of the internal market, of commercial integration, of the statistical system, of the system of veterinary and phytosanitary standards and to harmonising technical regulations; in short, to anything that requires cross-border instruments."
"We are familiar with these issues because we have faced them ourselves in the recent past."
"Furthermore, we have also developed cooperation strategies with a number of Mercosur countries involving sums of around EUR 200 million for the period that I have just mentioned."
"These strategies can also contribute to supporting regional integration, economic reform and social development."
"Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have a real need to pursue thoroughgoing reform."
"We shall continue to support this course of action at economic, social and political levels."
"Commissioner, your speech took the words right out of my mouth, since I was actually going to say that Commissioner Lamy has always answered my questions fully. I am very grateful to you for that, as I am always grateful to you for your answers to my questions during Parliamentary Question Time."
"In any event, I would like to say, before asking one last question, that the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur have just returned from Brasilia."
"We held meetings with members of the Brazilian Government, with parliamentary leaders, with the President of Congress, and with President Lula's principal advisors, and we realised once again that we are dealing here with an extraordinary country, which is setting in motion an exemplary social inclusion programme, which will be crucial to its future."
"As the Commissioner knows, this country also enjoys privileged economic relations with Europe, in addition to the traditional relations of cultural kinship."
"In addition, I myself have just spent a month and a half in Argentina, on political business, and have seen the progress that the country has made."
"Mercosur sees its connections with the European Union as a historical relationship between sister states, as a partnership which is essential in order to avoid subordination to the United States."
"That is why I ask whether the Commission is prepared to give special priority in future to its relations with Mercosur, and perhaps with the whole of South America, which may possibly join Mercosur."
"Mr President, my response to what the honourable Member has just suggested is broadly 'yes', in that we have clearly made Latin America's southern cone region one of our priorities, because these countries themselves have decided to work on integrating with one another."
"Our idea is that these efforts will be reproduced in other places, in the future, perhaps with the Andean community, perhaps with the communities of Central America."
"This concept of regional integration that we wish to encourage is therefore positive, not because it systematically converts everyone to the European model, but because we believe that, since these countries themselves have decided that integration is in their interest, they deserve our full and unremitting support."
"Question No 34 by Bernd Posselt (H-0380/03):"
"Subject: Foreign trade with southern Africa"
"What is the Commission's view of foreign trade developments between the EU and the countries in sub-Saharan Africa?"
"I shall try to answer Mr Posselt's question about trade relations between Africa and the European Union as briefly as I can."
"In trading matters, we are clearly Africa's main partner, with bilateral trade worth around EUR 150 billion, according to the figures for 2000, in other words, just under half of all Africa's external trade."
"This being the case, if we look at the matter in terms of trends, and more particularly of the trend to which the question refers, that is, trade between the Union and countries located south of the Sahara, the rate of change is clearly slow."
"If we look at the ACP countries in the sub-Saharan zone, the trend is for slight average growth, with some slumps, and I shall return to this."
"It is, in any event, lower than the growth in world trade."
"In the long term, the trend is for a slight increase, with total exports to Europe to the tune of EUR 30 billion."
"And, as I said, within this trend for a slow average increase there are occasional slumps."
"This was the case, for example, between 2001 and 2002, despite the 'Everything but arms' initiative which, in that period, provided around EUR 90 million for the whole of 2002, which was the first full year in which the system was implemented."
"The 'Everything but arms' initiative, therefore, to some extent offset the slump observed in 2001 and 2002."
"Beyond the figures, the main problem lies in the make-up of trade and exports from those countries, which still contains structural weaknesses because it is essentially dominated by some basic products, such as oil, diamonds and cocoa."
"Furthermore, around one third of exports from African countries to Europe consist of farm produce, which also makes our market the major outlet for African exports."
"How can we improve the situation?"
"I think that the concept involves trying to improve these countries' abilities to export to us and to diversify their economies."
"In order to achieve this we have a policy that has now stabilised and is one with which the European Parliament is familiar, because we discuss it often: first of all, stepping up regional integration amongst African countries themselves; second, strengthening economic and trade links between these countries and the EU; and lastly, gradually integrating African countries into the world economy, because we cannot lay claim to an exclusive relationship with them and nor would this be in their interests."
"To help us achieve this aim we also have a framework - the Cotonou framework - as well as negotiations on economic partnership agreements, which are making progress."
"At multilateral level, we have the framework of the WTO."
"This is why we are now in continuous discussion, if I may put it this way, with our African colleagues, not only in the context of regional relations - and I am here talking about the negotiations on economic partnership agreements - but also multilaterally, given the topicality of the Doha round of negotiations."
"In this context, we Europeans clearly have a partial responsibility to ensure that all these negotiations meet Africa's needs because, in my opinion, our African friends now have the means, which they did not have in the past, themselves to identify how this type of negotiation can best meet their needs."
"Mr President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for his reply."
"As we know, we tend to see Africa as very largely characterised by single industries; on the other hand, though, Africans see Europe as very much made up of conglomerates."
"What I want to ask you is what the Commission is doing in order - and I do know that this is in practice very difficult - to build up cooperation between sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union as regards small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There is virtually nothing moving on that front."
"I would like to know what is being done in the area of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Although most small businesses still do not dare to venture into the region, I do believe that they would make very important partners for Africa, if it is not to be dominated by single industries and conglomerates to the exclusion of all else."
"Your question is most pertinent."
"From the African point of view, constructing the economic fabric must clearly entail creating small businesses."
"It is also true that such businesses generally have less access than larger ones to international finance procedures."
"Having said that, with what we are doing in the field of development aid and technical assistance for training, with what we are doing to encourage trade and with what the European Investment Bank is now doing - and God knows it is putting enough effort into it! - in this region, the volume and the number of instruments available to the entrepreneurial initiative are, I believe, experiencing rapid growth."
"Investment is necessary even if it only pays off in the medium and long term and even if we have to wait until a reasonably sophisticated level of development has been achieved to ensure that small businesses - which are by definition much more reticent about taking risks than large companies - participate actively in the type of trade that we want to promote."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he agrees with the President of the United States of America that perhaps Europe's position on trade in genetically modified crops is having an effect on our trade with the southern African countries in agricultural products, thereby affecting their ability to feed themselves?"
"The answer to Mr Purvis's question is no."
"We do not agree with these statements and I have furthermore discussed the matter with the President, in a frank and direct way, as recently as last week at the EU-US Summit, which was held in Washington."
"Mr Purvis, we do not agree with this position and we sought to ensure that the President of the United States was informed of the matter, as they say in English, 'straight from the horse's mouth'."
"One of the reasons we do not agree is that we consider this to be an argument of dubious merit, used in an entirely justified cause and which is intended to promote the interests of GMO agri-food exports by the United States."
"There are other ways of proceeding, however, such as reducing food aid in kind, as we have done, in order to provide food aid in cash."
"In Africa in particular, we have funded food aid at regional level."
"Consequently, every country has choices to make, for or against GMOs, and we must not impose these choices on them."
"We simply hope that these countries retain their freedom to decide and their sovereignty."
"In order to ensure this, we simply have to reduce food aid in kind and increase financial aid for food, in line, furthermore, with the regulations of the various United Nations food programmes."
"You are quite right."
"In many cases I, like you, have noted that our joint efforts in the fields of promoting development, trade and human rights on this continent come up against political problems."
"I also believe that African leaders and the governments of these countries are more aware now than in the past of the need to address, both on their own and with one another, a number of political obstacles of this type."
"Programmes such as NEPAD - which we support because our work on regional integration in Africa closely mirrors the strategy adopted by this new partnership - are, in my opinion, moving in the same direction."
"I repeat; you are quite right."
"This being the case, what we have is a chicken and egg situation, in which the chicken is probably political and the egg is probably economic."
"Nevertheless, given the state of the world, we cannot refrain from using the eggs available to us in order to take things forward."
"This is a daily chore that requires patience."
"If we manage to convince a number of economic operators to work towards an environment that is more stable, less conflict-ridden and less disjointed, we could perhaps, here and there, create pressure for peace."
"If, on the other hand, communities and those who appoint their leaders are not interested, we will find it much more difficult to achieve our aim."
"Politicians certainly have a responsibility to free up some of these economic resources, but let us not stop working from the bottom up."
"This, I believe, would be a mistake."
"Question No 35 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0392/03):"
"Subject: WTO - TRIPS"
"What is the Commission's response to the concerns from the ACP about lack of agreement on the implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Declaration on TRIPS and public health?"
"Whilst the Declaration as a whole is an important step forward in the campaign for access to medicines, would the Commission agree that any attempt to restrict the agreement to a set list of diseases would be damaging?"
"Mrs Kinnock, the Commission shares your concern and your disquiet about the lack of an agreement that should have been concluded under the Doha declaration on the links between the TRIPs agreement on intellectual property and public health."
"As you probably know, the current blockage is the result of the US refusal to accept a compromise proposal which has been on the table in Geneva since December 2002 and which has been accepted by all Members of the World Trade Organisation except the United States and this is precisely wherein the problem lies."
"Our position on this matter is simple: Doha, and nothing but Doha."
"The compromise text of last December and nothing but the compromise text."
"Recently, furthermore - last month, to be precise - we submitted a written communication to the TRIPs Council and thus to the WTO, to remind them of our proposals and to insist that technical assistance is provided."
"This will enable us, once the problem is resolved, to implement the acquis of the Doha declaration."
"We also agree with the ACP countries' view on the need to maintain the scope of the Doha declaration."
"We believe that the Doha mandate is a broad one and this is acknowledged in the text that has been on the table since last December."
"We have always maintained this position, and this is why we proposed, at the beginning of the year, to call on the World Health Organisation to re-establish confidence and to find a way out of the current impasse."
"Our strategy remains the same."
"We want the Americans to accept the compromise text that has been on the table since December, without diminishing the scope of the text, where diseases are concerned."
"We will continue to make every effort to find a solution before the Cancun ministerial conference."
"A number of our friends in developing countries have intimated that, to some extent, unless agreement is reached on this point, everything that will be on the table in Cancun and, consequently, the outcome of the multilateral negotiations launched in Doha could be at risk."
"The issue is, therefore, one of our top priorities."
"Mr President, the Commissioner's commitment on this issue is not in doubt at all."
"The Commissioner will be aware of the letter that the President-in-Office of the ACP sent in May 2003 to the chair of the TRIPs Council, raising a number of issues."
"I believe it was a very good letter and one that covered the issues and concerns very well."
"The letter, however, refers to the EU proposals, and says that the EU is making an unacceptable attempt to restrict the ACP's use of compulsory licensing."
"It also mentions the references to the WHO and so on, with which the ACP countries are not happy. They are not happy with any suggestion that seems to deviate from the Doha Declaration, which sets no limitations of this kind."
"The application of the agreement on national emergencies is something the ACP and other developing countries are not happy with."
"Commissioner, I know that you are making every effort to bring the opposing sides together, but are you not putting yourself in danger of being seen as deviating from the content and understanding of the consensus which was so valiantly achieved in the Doha Declaration?"
"In the letter, the ACP countries ask whether there is a straightforward and easy way to implement a solution."
"Do you think, Commissioner, that it is at all possible for you to answer the ACP and say 'yes, it is possible for us to find a solution and implement it with reasonable ease'?"
"Question No 36 by Juan José Bayona de Perogordo (H-0399/03):"
"Subject: Unfair competition from goods imported from China"
"In the course of 2001, China greatly increased its exports of ceramics."
"The continuing existence of state-owned companies and the selling off of stocks from others which have already closed account for the fact that Chinese production prices are very low."
"Although the country still has limited export capacity, the EU's trade deficit is steadily increasing on account of unfair competitive practices, the most serious of which is the copying of EU ceramic products which are then labelled and sold as having been 'made in the EU'."
"Is the Commission planning to take action in order to prevent this type of fraud in the export of ceramics from China?"
"Are any negotiations being held with the Chinese authorities with a view to improving the terms and conditions under which Community businesses may secure access to a market in which, despite China's membership of the WTO, there are still major sources of discrimination and obstacles to investment?"
"I will respond very briefly to Mr Bayona de Perogordo's question."
"This matter is not very complicated in technical terms, but the question raises two separate issues: the first is the increase in imports of ceramic products from the People's Republic of China and the second, a problem of potential fraud with regard to the origin of these products."
"Where our imports of ceramics from the People's Republic of China are concerned, it is true that in 1994 quantity limits were applied to imports of this nature, and to tableware or kitchenware in particular."
"In the meantime, China joined the World Trade Organisation and, in recognition of this fact, it was decided to phase out these quantity limits, which will, therefore, disappear completely at the end of 2004."
"In 2001 there was an increase of just over 10% in imports of these products to the European market, whereas in 2002 there was a slight fall in numbers."
"Consequently, our markets are not being permanently flooded with these products."
"I now come to the second part of your question, which concerns problems relating to fraud."
"We have adequate instruments in place for combating fraud and we are prepared to make use of them."
"As I have already told European industrialists who have expressed concerns similar to yours, we would need more precise information on what these industrialists and you seem to consider to be fraudulent actions."
"The details are missing."
"Mr Bolkestein's services will study your additional information so that together we can work out whether an inquiry should be opened."
"Mr President, I am glad that the Commissioner sees the solution to a problem which concerns many European citizens and in particular the Spanish Ceramics Association in such simple and straightforward terms."
"I am actually delighted with the assessment you have made."
"With regard to the evolution of imports I agree completely, not so much in terms of fraud, because if you are saying that you have the appropriate mechanisms for combating it, I do not understand why you are waiting for the citizens of Europe to tell you what these fraudulent practices consist of, since I imagine that it is for you to take the initiative in this area."
"I do not believe, however, you have answered another part of the question on the measures the Commission would be prepared to take to promote the penetration by Community industry, by Community companies, into China."
"I believe that you agree with many European citizens and, amongst others, the ceramics industry, that the current situation is a fraud, causes harm and constitutes a threat for the future."
"My question is whether you agree with these citizens on the need to take measures to defend trade, to stimulate research and development and to promote penetration into the Chinese market."
"We must make clearly separate two issues."
"First of all, either suspicions of fraud about the products' origins are justified or they are not."
"This can quite easily be checked and investigated."
"We are doing so in a number of areas and once again, Mr Bolkestein and myself, as well as our services, work together on many such matters."
"What we need, in order to commit resources which, as you know, are scarce despite the considerable efforts of the European Parliament to give the Commission additional means, is to have sufficiently precise information, rather like a unit that is given the task of investigating fraud in the police force."
"Give us more precise details, then."
"Secondly, with regard to export opportunities in the ceramics sector, which is still a significant sector in a number of Member States, these do not depend on specific Community policies."
"Also on this subject, if our ceramics exporters, whose quality is recognised throughout the world found their access to the market of one third country or another obstructed because the countries concerned were not applying the open arrangements accepted bilaterally or within the World Trade Organisation, we would then set in motion the means available to us to help out our exporters."
"Mr President, my question is supplementary to that of Mr Bayona."
"I agree entirely with his arguments and I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to adopt the following five measures: firstly, to show the utmost commitment to anti-dumping cases, bearing in mind that Chinese companies are subjected to much less stringent parameters and levels than European ones in the fields of employment and the environment; secondly, whether he is also prepared to show that utmost commitment to anti-fraud measures, bearing in mind that, at this moment, it is possible to import without a mark, in any European port, Chinese goods which have a label in that port; thirdly, to strengthen research and development so that European companies can face up to Chinese competition; fourthly, to promote the entry and establishment of European companies in China, in view of the fact that, as the Commissioner knows, despite the fact that there has been a tariff restriction, entry tariffs in China depend on the port and the importer; and finally, whether he is prepared to set up an observatory to provide better knowledge of the practices which discriminate against and harm European industry."
"Very briefly, with regard to the fight against dumping and fraud, as I have said, we do have procedures in place."
"These procedures are transparent, regulated and precise and if we have the necessary details, with which the industry must provide us if we are to launch an inquiry or investigation - known as 'complaints' - we can take action."
"This must be done in the correct way, because we have to respect the rights both of the plaintiff and of the country against which a complaint is lodged."
"These are possible approaches, provided, of course, that we have the necessary information."
"With regard to problems in accessing the Chinese market, we are entirely willing to discuss these with our Chinese partners."
"I hold such discussions in other areas and if there is a need to do so in this specific area, I will say 'yes', provided that I am given the necessary information."
"As far as research and development is concerned, the issue does not really fall within my remit and with regard to the monitoring centre, I would advise industry professionals to look into this matter themselves."
"They are better qualified than we are to gather the necessary information and to decide when to convey this to us."
"I have a great interest in this question, both as the Member representing the region of Stoke-on-Trent in the United Kingdom and also as the deputy chairman of the European Parliament ceramics industry forum, which has had a dialogue with both Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I should like to ask Mr Lamy if he would comment on the issue of marks of origin, and confirm that the proposals being considered by Commissioner Byrne to require ceramic articles coming into contact with food to bear traceability marks showing the factory that they are made in - to trace any problems with toxic materials that may be in the articles concerned - would not in any way contravene existing WTO obligations."
"As he may be aware, Commissioner Byrne's services are actively considering this proposal at the moment and are having discussions with the European industry about that type of marking."
"There have been disturbing cases where articles from China have been found to contain levels of toxic materials that are significantly above the limits laid down in the European Union to safeguard human health."
"The industry would be very grateful for his confirmation that the proposals would not contravene any existing trade legislation."
"These issues of marks of origin are complex and we are discussing them in a very general way."
"They involve on the one hand a trade component, which is not covered by the question on the subject of ceramics and the work of my colleague, Mr Byrne, and on the other, a health component."
"The latter area involves more than just the problems of managing trade flows or the comparative advantages that some countries have."
"In this area, the World Trade Organisation's 'SPS' agreement, ( Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures ), gives us, as Europeans, the opportunity to adopt the necessary measures to protect the health of our consumers."
"In order to be adopted, these measures must meet the requirements for advance notification, transparency and justification that the SPS agreement and the case-law in the field have established on several occasions."
"Accordingly, if the conditions are transparent and clear, and if the scientific evidence justifies the need for a particular protection measure on the grounds of health, the SPS agreement allows trade barriers to be put in place, and quite rightly so!"
"Mr Lamy, I am sorry to give you more work, but, as we had announced, we are going to reinstate the question by Mr Zacharakis, which had been reserved for this Question Time."
"Question No 30 by Christos Zacharakis (H-0389/03):"
"Subject: Contravention of international legal rules by Turkey, and danger of causing a serious accident to a passenger aeroplane in Greek airspace"
"On 9 June 2003, two Turkish F-16 fighter planes harassed an Olympic Airways aircraft on the Athens-Istanbul route, placing the lives of the passengers in direct danger."
"The aircraft's automatic crash avoidance safety system was triggered and Greek fighter planes were forced to intercept the Turkish planes."
"This action constitutes a clear contravention of the rules of international law and, more specifically, a violation of European Union airspace and thus of its territorial integrity, placing the safety of EU citizens in danger, and represents a violation of fundamental standards of international conduct, such as those enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the United Nations Charter and included within the Copenhagen criteria."
"It is a reflection of a systematic Turkish policy which leads to tension in relations between Greece and Turkey and directly threatens the peace and security of the region."
"In view of these facts, what urgent steps does the Commission intend to take to put a stop to such aggressive acts by Turkey and to prevent their repetition in the future, and what consequences will the Turkish strategy adopted to date have on the assessment of the country's progress towards EU membership?"
"On a point of order, this may well delay other questions: Mr Zacharakis was not here when his question was called and, according to the rules of the House, it should lapse."
"Mr Bolkestein and Mr Byrne will each speak for 20 minutes and we have to finish before 7 o'clock, so I would ask you to continue, as the rules require, with Mr Bolkestein's section."
"Mr Purvis, we are going to allow each of the Commissioners their 20 minutes, which will mean a delay of 12 or 13 minutes in the timetable of this Question Time, which has already begun late."
"But I had committed myself, having changed the order of Mr Zacharakis's question, to that question being replied to today at the end of questions to Mr Lamy."
"We must respect that commitment."
"I would ask the other Commissioners' forgiveness. This in no way jeopardises their respective turns of 20 minutes."
"If I have understood correctly, this issue concerns an incident that occurred in airspace between Greece and Turkey."
"The Commission does not have specific information on this incident, beyond what has been reported in the press."
"With the cautiousness that this type of statement requires, we believe that this incident must be seen in the context of the dispute between Greece and Turkey over the Aegean Sea."
"We hope that this issue of national airspace, as well as that of territorial waters and the continental shelf - over which these two countries, to my knowledge, have been arguing for some time now - will be resolved in the course of the meetings taking place between the Greek and Turkish authorities."
"With regard to Turkey, as a country that is applying to join the European Union, it has given a commitment to meet a number of criteria and the Commission recalls, in response to your question, Mr Zacharakis, the principle of what is called the peaceful settlement of border disputes."
"This has always been our approach, in line with the criteria set out in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council of 1999."
"We also made this issue a specific priority for the review of the partnership for Turkish accession, which was adopted in May 2003."
"Accordingly, as on other matters requiring progress on the part of Turkey, we will closely follow developments in this matter and will present a detailed assessment in the periodic report that we are due to publish at the beginning of November."
"Mr President, Commissioner, please excuse me for not being present when you called my question."
"I had to attend another Parliamentary meeting."
"I would like to answer Mr Zacharakis very briefly by saying that, to my knowledge, despite the most strenuous efforts of Mrs de Palacio in this area over several years, we have still not quite established a non-segregated Community airspace."
"To my knowledge, therefore, we are dealing at this stage with Greek airspace."
"Secondly, the Helsinki conclusions do indeed contain a reference to the need for Turkey to find peaceful solutions to possible border disputes with its neighbours, and we know that borders exist on land, at sea and in the skies."
"Thirdly, preliminary negotiations are taking place between Turkey and Greece on this type of issue. Their content is not made public, which I feel demonstrates a basic sense of caution, especially in the run-up to the electoral period."
"Fourthly and lastly, we will take into account, as I said a moment ago, the overall progress made by Turkey in the areas specified at Helsinki when we pronounce on this matter both this year and, of course, next year."
"Question No 37, by Mr Karas, has been withdrawn."
"Question No 38 by Lennart Sacrédeus (H-0376/03):"
"Subject: Member State's tax subsidy of abortion for other EU citizens"
"In early April 2003, the Swedish Government announced in the Riksdag, through the Equal Opportunities Minister Margareta Winberg, that it was prepared to review the law on abortion to consider whether women who are not resident in Sweden, and therefore not Swedish citizens, should still be able to have an abortion in the country."
"The underlying logic of the proposal is that taxpayers in one Member State of the EU - Sweden - would bear the costs and therefore, in practice, offer services to citizens from other Member States for an activity which is illegal in Member States such as Ireland and Portugal as well as in the new Member States of Poland and Malta."
"Does the Commission consider that the Swedish Government's proposal is consistent with the Treaties or the spirit of the Treaties concerning mutual solidarity given that it is prepared to subsidise an activity in Sweden for other EU citizens, which is illegal in other Member States, through taxation?"
"Would such conduct support or undermine other Member States' legislation?"
". The Swedish Minister for Equal Opportunities has indicated to the Swedish Parliament the readiness of her government to consider modification of the Swedish law on abortion so that the Swedish authorities would cover the costs of an abortion, not only for Swedish nationals and people residing in Sweden, but also for nationals from other Member States who have an abortion in Sweden."
"The Commission would point out that Member States are free to determine to whom they wish to extend financial coverage for the cost of medical treatment."
"Accordingly, there is nothing in Community law that would prevent the Swedish Government from amending its legislation in the manner proposed."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer, but I still think he is leaving the basic question unanswered, namely that of mutual solidarity and of conduct towards each other in the European Union."
"Is that mutual solidarity not in this way undermined?"
"It is, of course, inevitable that the Member States' different laws and values will make themselves felt in different forms of legislation."
"What is, however, unique and serious in this case is that it entails subsidising, for foreign citizens of other Member States, an activity that I specified by name in my question, that is illegal in a number of Member States and that involves inviting citizens of other EU countries to engage in an activity that is illegal in these EU countries."
"My follow-up question is as to whether that would not undermine solidarity with, and mutual respect for, each other in the European Union."
". May I stress that the Commission is of the opinion that such an amendment to Swedish legislation - which has not yet taken place: it is an amendment proposed by the Swedish Government - would have no direct impact on the legislation of existing or future Member States."
"Indeed, the Commission is of the view that the changes in attitude within some Member States regarding issues such as abortion are driven by public opinion rather than by external factors."
"The reflection of this is the fact that the legal regimes on abortion in Member States are still very divergent, as indeed the Member who has just spoken will recognise."
"Whilst it is illegal in one Member State, it is legal in others - subject, of course to varying restrictions."
"In short, the fact that in some Member States, such as Ireland, abortion is against the law, does not mean that, if the Swedish Government were to pass the amendment I described, it would not be allowed to extend benefits to whoever it liked."
"It is within the competence of the Swedish Government to take a decision on that, and the extent of benefits allowed under Swedish legislation would, as I said earlier, have no impact on the legislation of a country where abortion is forbidden, such as Ireland."
"Question No 39 by Antonios Trakatellis (H-0398/03):"
"Subject: Use of a mathematical formula in awarding public contracts: distortion of the rules of competition"
"Recent newspaper articles discuss the intervention of the Commission which has called on the Greek authorities to postpone awards of public contracts until the curious system for awarding public contracts on the basis of a mathematical formula has been modified. The same publications claim that this formula has cost the Greek economy EUR 800 million."
"According to the Commission's answer to my previous question on the use of a mathematical formula in awarding public contracts in Greece (H-0097/03)"
". The Commission has examined with due attention the issue of the application in Greece of a mathematical formula to be detect abnormally low offers in the context of public tenders."
"Following a request from the Commission the Hellenic authorities notified the relevant national legislation in January 2003."
"While proceeding with its assessment the Commission received a new complaint on the same matter, which gave a better picture of how the whole system of the mathematical formula is applied in practice, since the latter complaint did not concern the legislation in abstract, but made reference to concrete examples of its application."
"On the basis of this new information, the Commission services addressed a letter to the competent Hellenic authorities in late April 2003, asking them to take a position on specific issues raised in relation to the compatibility of the Hellenic legislation and practice with Community public procurement legislation and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice."
"The Commission services have very recently received a request on behalf of the Hellenic authorities to extend the time given to them to reply to this new letter until 30 June 2003, in order for them to give a comprehensive answer on the whole issue and in view of certain changes that they envisage concerning the relevant legislation."
"The Commission services have granted this extension and now await the answer of the Hellenic authorities."
"Once they receive this reply and the changes that the Hellenic authorities propose to their national legislation regulating the mathematical formula for identification of abnormally low offers, they will come to a final assessment of the compatibility of the system applied in relation to Community public procurement legislation."
"The formula in question is so complicated that even Greek experts have great difficulty in understanding how it works."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer."
"I would like to ask you whether it is your preliminary assessment that this mathematical formula really is compatible with Community law."
"I cannot see why the Greek authorities proceeded, as you said, to change the law, as the Greek Parliament already has the capacity to deal with this."
"I would like, therefore, to have your preliminary assessment."
"Also, although this was a formula for avoiding very low offers, it had a damaging effect on the overall assessment of public works, owing to the very small percentage of the original amount intended for the public works concerned."
". In response to these last two questions by Mr Trakatellis, I should like once again to reaffirm that the Commission has not yet finalised its assessment, but it has raised some issues of the compatibility of the Hellenic system with regard to the possibility given to the tenderers to justify their low offer."
"If that were not the case, the Commission would not undertake this work."
"I cannot say more than this."
"May I say to Mr Trakatellis that fortunately I, personally, have not had to investigate this formula since apparently, as I said earlier, it is so complex that even the Greek experts have difficulty in understanding it."
"Question No 40 by Elly Plooij-van Gorsel (H-0402/03):"
"Subject: Principle of 'fair compensation'"
"Directive 2001/29/EC"
". (NL) Mr President, I can confirm that the principle of 'fair compensation', as described in the directive, is a new concept, to be distinguished from the right to receive fair remuneration, indicated with the term 'copyright' in the context of reproduction for private use."
"As is indicated in the directive, the concept of fair compensation offers Member States a considerable degree of flexibility or freedom of judgment when they decide on the form, the modalities or the level of fair compensation regulations."
"However, pursuant to recitals 35 and 38, Member States that apply copyright meet the condition that fair compensation must be in place."
"Relevant legislation implementing the directive need not necessarily contain a specific reference to the principle of fair compensation."
"In accordance with the directive, Member States are obliged to ensure that fair compensation is in place for three of the exceptions to the reproduction right listed in the directive."
"First of all, there is the exception of reproduction for private use."
"This is the exception with most relevance for copyright, because usually, rights are levied with regard to reproduction for private use of sound and audio-visual material."
"The second one pertains to the exception for reprographics or photocopying and the third one relates to transmissions in some social institutions such as hospitals or prisons."
"It seems probable that the Member States that had levy systems in place in the past, will continue to allow reproduction for private use in combination with levy systems and that they will also apply these to certain digital products."
"It is true that the different systems continue to result in differences in application with regard to carriers or equipment to which they apply and/or the amounts claimed, including the differences in application to digital carriers."
"This is due to the fact that the EC legislator ruled against a higher degree of harmonisation during negotiations about the directive."
"As far as analogue copying for private use is concerned, the directive acknowledges that it is unlikely that the existing differences will have a major impact on the development of the information society."
"With regard to digital copying for private use, the directive underlines that due account must be given to differences between digital and analogue copying for private use, and that in certain cases, a distinction must be drawn between them."
"At the same time, it must be stressed that the directive does not require Member States to abolish copyright, or to take a stand for or against copyright in comparison to digital rights management systems."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although I am grateful to you for your extensive and clear response, I am nevertheless left with a problem."
"At the end of your intervention, you draw a clear distinction between analogue and digital copying, whereby the former would not be harmful to the information society, while the latter would."
"As far as I know - and I have been involved in information society legislation for years - we in Europe specifically do not draw a distinction between digital and analogue, in the sense that legislation must be technology-neutral."
"So I am a little taken aback by your statement."
"Moreover, I am surprised that the directive does not tend more towards harmonisation, particularly because your offices initially indicated that it would do so."
"Where fair compensation is concerned, it is important to establish whether the rightholder is actually being adversely affected, whether any technological protection measures are available and whether any other payment is made to the rightholder."
"This is why I think that it is regrettable after all that Member States are not required to adapt their legislation in the sense that only fair compensation is granted."
". (NL) Mr President, I can well imagine the disappointment felt by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but, as I have indicated before, the legislator - which thus includes the European Parliament - was of the opinion that far-reaching harmonisation was not desirable."
"This is how the legislation process went and there is nothing we can do about it now."
"However, I do understand why Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is disappointed."
"It might have been preferable to apply a higher level of harmonisation but this is not how it was decided."
"Allow me perhaps to correct the Commissioner on one point: Parliament would probably have wanted to see a greater degree of harmonisation where the current directive is concerned."
"I have, however, a question for those of you responsible for the internal market."
"You said that existing differences in levy systems were of no significance."
"I believe that we need to investigate this area specifically with the internal market in mind."
"Are the differences in the levy systems between the countries of Europe of any significance?"
"Do they impede the internal market and lead to distortion?"
"I believe that our examination of the trend we have in Europe should start specifically from the perspective of a functioning internal market."
"I believe it would be important to obtain an account of the ways in which fair compensation or fair remuneration have developed."
"What are the facts of the case?"
"Above all, I wish, however, to say to you, as Commissioner with responsibility for the internal market, that I believe that the differences in levies affect consumer behaviour and create unequal conditions of competition."
". Let us see how all this works in practice."
"As Mrs Thors and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel know, the directive has not been transposed in the legislation of all Member States."
"The Commission hopes that this will soon be the case."
"It may be that a more significant degree of harmonisation would have been better for the internal market. But as I said earlier in reply to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, unfortunately that is not the case and we have the directive that was approved by Council and Parliament."
"So let us see how this works in practice and how quickly the whole system of digital right management is put in practice in Europe."
"If Mrs Thors would then like to ask the Commission for further investigations and analysis, the Commission would be more than willing to oblige."
"The issue is important and essential aspects of the internal market are at stake."
"Question No 41 by Patricia McKenna (H-0362/03):"
"Subject: Rapid Alert Notifications"
"Will the Commission publish an annual breakdown of the 'Alert Notifications', 'Informations', 'Addition to Alerts' and 'Addition to Informations' issued between 1992 and 2003 by food product and country of origin, deviating the brand name, supermarket or company involved?"
"Will the Commission indicate how it will publish such information and the timeframe involved?"
"If the Commission is unwilling to publish such information, will it please explain how such unwillingness could be deemed to be in the public interest?"
". The regulation on general food law, which entered into force in February 2002, contains new provisions as regards the rapid alert system."
"With a view to increasing transparency according to Article 10, the Commission published for the first time a report on the rapid alert system for food and feed for the year 2002."
"We will do so for each subsequent year."
"However, we cannot apply the food law retroactively and go back as far as 1992."
"The publication of this annual report was, however, only the first step."
"In addition, since the end of May 2003, the Commission has published, on the Internet, summary reports containing information on all notifications received on a weekly basis."
"These reports contain information on the type of product and the problem identified, the origin of the product and the notifying Member State."
"The rapid alert system defined in Article 50 of the regulation is designed primarily as a tool for the rapid transmission of information amongst competent authorities in cases where a risk has been identified and measures have already been taken by the notifying Member State, such as withholding, recalling, seizure or rejection of the products concerned."
"The quick transmission of information allows all other Member States to verify immediately whether they are also affected by the problem in question, or to ensure that a product rejected at one point of entry does not enter through another place."
"It also ensures coherent and simultaneous actions by all Member States."
"In cases where a product is still on the market and should not be consumed, the authorities of the Member States are in a position to take all the necessary urgent measures, including providing direct information to the public."
"In addition, the information collected by the rapid alert system is used by the Commission."
"For example, my services use the information to set priorities for the Food and Veterinary Office and to propose measures such as suspension of the placing on the market, suspension of imports or any other emergency measure under Article 53 of the regulation."
"The Commission also uses this information to assist third countries."
"When products subject to a notification originate from a third country, its competent authorities are systematically informed in order to enable them to correct the problem at source and prevent further cases."
"It is true that, according to Article 52 of the Food Law Regulation, the Commission does not publish trade names and the identity of individual companies in the regular rapid alert summaries."
"However, where emergency measures are taken by Member States or the Commission, in the light of the analysis of the risk posed by the alert, such relevant information on the products concerned by the action is made public."
"The RASFF is used both to take actions to prevent further occurrence of food-related risks and to react immediately to such related risks in order to provide consumers with safe food."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for that information."
"In relation to trade names and individual companies it is very important that a vague system of alerts is in place which allows the consumer to make a choice."
"Does the Commission not agree that if a product or food producer causes an alert then it is both in the consumer's interest and indeed in the interest of the open market that this information should be made public?"
"I would like to ask the Commissioner a question concerning the 2002 rapid alerts."
"Apparently, 26% of rapid alerts in 2002 were caused by fish."
"What is the breakdown of these alerts between farmed fish and wild fish?"
"The consumer has a right to know if farmed fish cause a disproportionate number of rapid alerts."
"Is DG SANCO taking any specific action to address this problem?"
"Does the Commissioner have this information on him now?"
"It would be very useful to have this information on the breakdown as regards fish."
". In further response to Mrs McKenna's question, firstly, I would not characterise our system of alert as being in any way vague."
"It is very targeted and the purpose of the exercise is, as I am sure she will appreciate, to transmit as fast as possible the relevant information to the competent authorities of all Member States, so that they can make a rapid response and take rapid action in relation to the risk that has been identified in respect of any particular food or feed in question."
"What is important here is public health, rather than some kind of naming and shaming."
"I would like to emphasise that once the rapid alert has been made and responses have been taken, and if it is shown that it is a genuine problem from which consumers need to be protected, the Member States in question, where there is a risk - and it is for them to determine this - will immediately inform their own consumers in their Member State."
"That is their responsibility under the rapid alert system."
"In those circumstances it would be appropriate for them to then identify, for instance, trade names or companies which would assist consumers to make the appropriate response."
"However, bear in mind that the rapid alert system is designed to allow Member States to react quickly and to remove, for instance, foods from the market."
"In addition to that, if it is necessary on further reflection and further analysis of the information that has come from the rapid alert - which is activated under Article 50 - that an emergency procedure under Article 53 is necessary, this would be something which could again be done at Member State level or, indeed, could also be done by the Commission."
"In those circumstances, the relevant information that would be made available would include the information that you referred to relating to trade names and companies, etc."
"I want to emphasise that the rapid alert is designed for a specific purpose, which is to transmit information as fast as possible, even in circumstances where all information may not be available."
"The important issue here is to identify the risk to the public to which the Member States must respond."
"I believe, in those circumstances, we have struck the correct balance."
"In relation to the second part of your question concerning the figures for 2002, I do not have the specific figures to hand relating to the breakdown between farmed fish and wild fish, but I am sure this kind of information is available to my services."
"I will seek to ensure that it is made available by them and transmitted to you in the normal course."
"Question No 42 will not be replied to since its subject appears on the agenda of the present part-session."
"Question No 43 by John Purvis (H-0369/03):"
"Subject: Cost-benefit analysis of the identification and registration of sheep and goats"
"The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the identification and registration of sheep and goats is a cause of deep concern in Scotland."
"The manual scheme is both impractical and expensive for the Scottish sheep farming and processing industry, which is already struggling financially."
"Since my enquiry in April (H-0149/03"
". The Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease crisis."
"In its resolution on foot and mouth disease of December 2002, the European Parliament stated that the Commission should as quickly as possible submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats."
"According to current legislation sheep and goats must be identified with an eartag or a tattoo linked to the holding."
"The keepers must keep an up-to-date register on the holding, and the competent authority must keep an up-to-date central register of holdings."
"The main new elements of the proposed system are individual identification, double eartagging to ensure that identity is retained where one eartag is lost, and the introduction of a movement document."
"Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases."
"The introduction of a reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, allowing the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of the disease."
"Furthermore it will allow accurate tracing of animals in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community."
"Finally, such a system would assist in reducing fraud."
"The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied."
"The Commission launched a large-scale pilot project - the IDEA Project - in 1998."
"The final report of this project, which included sheep and goats, as well as bovine animals, was completed in 2002."
"However, the implementing measures required for the proper introduction of the system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be fully developed."
"The proposal therefore provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with entry into force of obligatory electronic tagging foreseen for 1 July 2006."
"I am well aware of the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States."
"The proposal therefore includes options, which would allow: Member States to defer the identification of lambs up to the age of 6 months, where sheep are kept under extensive farming conditions, for instance in Scotland - to which the questioner referred;"
"Member States to apply simplified identification arrangements to young lambs, up to six months of age, intended for direct slaughter."
"The options decided upon will influence the likely costs to the farmers of introducing the new system."
"The estimation of the costs of introduction of the reinforced system on a Community-wide basis has to take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States."
"In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems."
"On this basis, the overall costs of the reinforced system are estimated to vary between EUR 1 for traditional eartags to EUR 3.7 for electronic identification per sheep per year."
"I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities."
"But these efforts in my opinion and in the opinion of the Commission are both worthwhile and necessary."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware of the extreme impracticality of the manual tagging of individual sheep, and its maintenance for a further two years."
"Has he ever seen an auction market?"
"I am sure that in his home country of Ireland the situation is the same as in Scotland, where you have thousands of sheep going through in one day and each individual sheep has to be inspected and tagged as it goes through."
"That will add days to sales for only for two years' worth of savings."
"Could he not and has he not considered doing this on a flock basis, as opposed to an individual sheep basis, for this two-year period of time?"
". In answer to the supplementary question from Mr Purvis, let me say that I, the Commission and my advisers have considered the possibility of herd tagging."
"I raised that question specifically with them."
"The answer they gave me - and it seemed credible - is that the system of herd tagging you suggest does not have the same degree of security in circumstances where you may have an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or similar."
"Also, for the reason that you identify in your supplementary question, in these markets that we see in Scotland and in my home country of Ireland as well, herds arrive, they are sub-divided into other herds, they are separated so that the chance of following a particular herd number and getting the information that you need in the case of an outbreak of disease is diluted to a considerable extent."
"In fact, it eliminates the opportunity of following a particular animal that may be carrying that particular disease."
"In those circumstances, the only alternative available to us was to come forward with an individual identification tag system."
"I acknowledge this will last for an interim transition period until electronic tagging comes into play: it is scheduled for 1 July 2006."
"I have to say to Mr Purvis that there are many people calling for this system of tagging for the reason that I have identified."
"Member States want it, even the Member States that have large sheep populations and trade a lot in sheep, both within the Member State and across borders."
"For those reasons, the degree of support that exists in the Community for this proposal is strong."
"Therefore, in the light of the need to protect animal health and for other reasons it seems necessary to come forward with that particular proposal."
"Finally, I should again draw attention to what I said a moment ago: the Commission has taken into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in Member States and the proposal includes options which Member States may decide to apply under certain circumstances."
"For instance, for animals kept in extensive farming conditions and in free range, the age of tagging may be extended from one month to six months of age, but, in any event, before leaving the holding of birth."
"Also, for animals intended for slaughter before six months of age, the identification code may be the code of the holding of birth and the month of birth."
"Under this system, instead of each individual animal, groups of animals with the same identification code are recorded in the holding register and the movement document."
"That is a measure that was introduced in the legislation in ease of the kind of farming that I know exists in some remote areas in Scotland and, to a very large extent, meets the case that you have put forward in trying to respond to the concerns that you address."
"Where the animals are obviously over six months of age, then, of course, individual tagging must take place for the reason I have already identified."
"Question No 44 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0378/03):"
"Subject: Irresponsible rise in cases of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or 'Mad cow disease' in Spain"
"The EU Scientific Committee indicated as long ago as June 2000 that Spain was a high risk country for BSE, while the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture described the report published by that body as 'irresponsible' (all of which was the subject of various Parliamentary questions I submitted in 2000)."
"In recent months there has been a sharp increase in the number of BSE cases in Spain and that number is still continuing to rise. Does this not indicate that the 1996 Community ban on bone meal for ruminants has not been correctly transposed in Spain?"
". The Scientific Steering Committee has classified Spain as a GBR III country, having confirmed cases at a lower level."
"The upper limit of this level is an incidence of 100 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months."
"The BSE incidence in Spain has been increasing since the beginning of 2002."
"The incidence is, however, still well below this upper limit of around 45 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months, and it is not increasing rapidly."
"Therefore, the classification of Spain by the Scientific Steering Committee still remains valid."
"In the first quarter of this year, Spain reported about 50% more BSE cases than during the corresponding period last year."
"At the same time the number of cases decreased or was stable in all other Member States, except Portugal."
"Compared with other Member States, Spain has a rather high rate of young animals born in 1997 and 1998."
"The feeding of ruminant proteins to ruminants is considered to be the main source of BSE transmission to cattle."
"Therefore, the Commission imposed a Community-wide prohibition of the use of mammalian proteins in ruminant feed in 1994."
"It is, however, evident that this ban was not fully enforced at that time, since most of the BSE cases reported today were born after 1994."
"Meat-and-bone meal continued to be allowed in feed for non-ruminants, and thereby ruminant feed was contaminated in feed mills and during storage and transport."
"Another source of transmission was cross-feeding of feed intended for non-ruminants to cattle on mixed farms."
"Shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban were observed throughout the Community."
"To put an end to the transmission of BSE the feed ban was extended to the use of all animal proteins in feed for all farmed animals at the beginning of 2001."
"Other measures to reduce the transmission of BSE are improved rendering standards - which came into effect in early 1997 - and a ban on the use of so-called BSE risk materials in food and feed, which became effective in October 2000."
"The current Community legislation should, if rigorously implemented, be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected."
"BSE cases will, nevertheless, continue to appear in Spain, as in other Member States, for a number of years because of an incubation time of four to six years or even longer."
"That is why it is important to maintain current safeguards, in particular the removal of specified risk material."
"Commissioner, in the course of that very technical and diplomatic reply, in which you were so careful not to cause alarm, I believe I heard you confirm between the lines that Spain has in fact been failing to comply with that prohibition laid down in Community legislation since 1996."
"The increase in mad cow disease which has taken place in Spain as well in recent years - and your words also confirm this - is the result of the fact that the then Spanish Minister, Mr Arias Cañete, who denied that Spain was at risk - and the Scientific Committee did state this - was not complying with the Community legislation, and this is the reason for this proliferation and increase in mad cow disease."
"Commissioner, is this confirmed non-compliance by Spain of the Community legislation on the prohibition of meat-and-bone meal not reprehensible?"
"Is this non-compliance not reprehensible?"
"Your reply can only be yes."
"There is no social alarm, but it is non-compliance with the legislation which has made Spain the leading country in terms of mad cow disease in recent years."
". In response to the supplementary question, let me say that the Commission does not know the exact reason why the number of BSE cases is still increasing in Spain and not in other Member States, with the exception of Portugal, as I mentioned earlier."
"Possible explanations, in addition to shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban, are introduction of the removal of specified risk materials in Spain only at the end of 2000 and a higher than average exposure to infected meat and bone meal in the 1996-1998 period."
"It should be stressed, however, that the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office has carried out missions in Spain in order to verify the correct implementation of the Community provisions with regard to the control and eradication of BSE in 2001 and 2002."
"Shortcomings are still being detected."
"Spain has also informed the Commission of a number of breaches of the feed ban detected in 2002."
"The number of breaches is very small and below the average in Member States."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 45 to 78 will be answered in writing"
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, consumers have to have adequate information about the content and composition of the food that they buy."
"This is true not only as regards what we were talking about this afternoon; it also applies to ingredients."
"What it says on the outside must be on the inside, no more and no less."
"Changes in society over the past twenty years have also left their mark on our eating habits."
"Who, nowadays, peels their carrots and potatoes themselves?"
"Many do not have the time to do it, while all too many have forgotten how to cook or never learned in the first place."
"This also resulted in profound changes to the food industry, with complicated processing methods and new ingredients giving rise to finished and half-finished products capable of being prepared quickly and simply, but with ignorance about them breeding uncertainty."
"Numerous recent health warnings have made the need for information even more urgent, to which one must add the substantial increase in the number of food allergies."
"People suffering from food allergies rely on the proper listing of what a product contains."
"We have now reached second reading stage, and the greater part of the Commission proposal is made up of the Common Position, which limits the number of derogations and takes on board most of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading stage, notably the regular revision of the list of allergenic substances and of the way in which it is to be interpreted, the inclusion of celery and mustard in the list and the mandatory indication on the labels of preparations of sauces or mustards of ingredients amounting to less than 5% of the end-product."
"I still see the table of allergenic ingredients as the most important element in this directive."
"The list is to be drawn up on the basis of the latest scientific findings, revised on a regular basis and updated where necessary."
"At second reading stage, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted three amendments, all of which have the same objective in mind, that of removing the requirement to include on the label processing aids manufactured from substances on the list of allergenic substances, but no longer present in the end product and thus not liable to trigger an allergic reaction."
"Checks must be carried out to establish if a product is still allergenic if, in the course of its production, a processing aid was used that was allergenic in its original form - protein is one example - but which has lost its allergenic character as a result of the food production process, or which is either no longer present, or present in a modified form."
"Those who legislate are to establish that this is the case before requiring labelling."
"Processing aids have been in use for decades, including in the production of wine and beer."
"They undergo change in the course of the fermentation process and are naturally precipitated or filtered out."
"It is therefore a matter of certainty that they are no longer present in the wine or beer that is eventually produced."
"Allergies have hitherto been unheard-of in this area."
"As a wine-grower myself, how am I to explain to my fellow wine-growers or to my customers that labels must in future bear the legend 'made with eggs'?"
"Wine is a pure and clear product of nature, clear and golden in the glass."
"No research has been done into allergic reactions to it, as nobody has ever heard of there being any - so why this new requirement for labels?"
"Politics, however, is about doing what is possible, and so I have, with the Commission and the Council, arrived at a compromise making it possible for evidence to be brought within a fixed period of four years."
"The first point to be made here is that substances in connection with which a study has been notified to the Commission are provisionally exempted from being indicated on labels."
"The second is that, if the study demonstrates that these substances have no allergenic effect, they will continue to be exempted from the labelling requirement."
"I ask the Commission - and you, Mr Byrne - to confirm to me that further new studies can be commissioned and notified up to nine months after the directive's entry into force, and that exemption from mandatory labelling will apply for a full four years."
"This is important if we are to have studies of all types."
"This new directive gives consumers certainty."
"Only 2% of ingredients are not required to be included on the label, as against the former 25%."
"For the first time, there is a list of allergenic substances that must always appear on the label, and we will produce scientific evidence in order to ensure that labels state only what is contained."
"We are thus avoiding the possibility of excessive labelling making the list of foods allowed to allergy-sufferers ever smaller."
"I think we should take this sensible approach of compromise."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Klaß."
"I would remind all my fellow Members of the rules of the game."
"Each one of us really must keep to the speaking time allotted to us for our speeches this evening, since our work will take us until almost midnight."
"I shall endeavour to bang my gavel as required in order to let you know that your speaking time has elapsed. I will then ask you to conclude very speedily."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to begin by referring briefly to the report by Mrs Klaß in order to support the compromise amendment relating to the official list of ingredients which must appear in Annex IIIa within two years."
"I am doing so because there are products such as casein, egg albumin or fish glue which have been used for centuries in the production of wine and beer and which figure amongst the oenological practices laid down and permitted by Regulations (EC) Nos 1493/1999 and 1622/2000 and, above all, because there is no scientific evidence that they act as allergens in the final product."
"Why do we have to place them under suspicion by subjecting them to labelling?"
"The Council and the Commission must accept Parliament's view of this problem."
"Having said this, I will move on to my own report."
"I would firstly like to sincerely thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Lund and Mrs Paulsen, for their excellent cooperation in reaching compromises which may allow us to approve this proposal for a directive at first reading."
"My main concern during the production of this report has been that the food additives included in it should not only represent technological progress but they should not pose any risk to health nor cause misunderstanding amongst consumers."
"The compromise amendments we are presenting to plenary, together with the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group (Amendments Nos 19 to 32) are the result of this concern that we all share."
"Framework Directive 89/107/EEC on additives, in its Annex II, specifies that 'all food additives must be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary'."
"However, in view of the existing concern about the use of polysorbates, of the ruling of the Court of Justice of 20 March 2003, on the maximum doses of nitrites and nitrates, and the declaration of the Scientific Committee on Food of 4 April 2003, on derivatives of parahydroxybenzoic acid, two new paragraphs for Article 2 are being presented by means of Amendment No 21."
"The intention is that the Commission should review the use of additives E 432 to E 436 (that is, polysorbates), E 251, E 252, and E 249 to E 250 (which are nitrates and nitrites) and that, before 1 July 2004, the conditions of use for parabens, from E 214 to E 219, should be revised."
"With regard to biphenyl, orthophenyl phenol and sodium orthophenyl phenol, which will now be classed as plant protection products, the Commission's intention is to include them in the future in the legislation of pesticides, removing them from Directive 95/2/EC."
"We agree with this and our only desire is that a legal vacuum should not be created, as indicated in Amendment No 21 and Amendment No 4 of the report which was approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We are also concerned that additives may be introduced into foods by means of additives in flavourings which are not required to be labelled."
"We are therefore presenting Amendment No 22 to restrict its use to the minimum necessary in order to guarantee the quality and safety of the flavouring when it has no technological function in the food."
"Otherwise, these flavouring additives will have to be labelled."
"In conclusion, I would like to stress that it is very important that we make consumers aware that thanks to the legislation on additives and the work of the Scientific Committee on Food they can enjoy adequate food safety and food products which are suited to their needs."
"These days our cities are increasingly large and industry needs more and more new additives and this makes our lives easier when it comes to consuming cooked or prepared products."
"I would like once again to thank the Council, the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to reaching these important agreements."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it looks as if, this evening and tomorrow, we shall be able to solve the issue of the views to be taken of hormones and their use in connection with animal rearing in which there is a dispute between the EU and the United States."
"I shall address this issue in three ways."
"Firstly, I wish to express my gratitude; secondly, I wish to explain why I do not like the compromise; and thirdly, I wish to explain why, in spite of everything, I support the compromise."
"I want to address a very big thank-you to everyone who has contributed: to the Commission, the Council, the committee secretariat and all my colleagues and fellow MEPs in the committee - the shadow rapporteurs - who have been of very great help to us in reaching this solution."
"It really is, of course, the case that we do not want these hormones, especially oestradiol 17? which is used, for example in the United States, as a growth stimulant."
"We do not want them in our food and nor, for that reason, must we of course use them in such a manner that they may end up in our food."
"In that way, we should be more credible in our negotiations, for example within the WTO, with the United States."
"If they are used as growth stimulants, then they are clearly present in our food."
"They involve a health risk for human beings and are carcinogenic."
"If we use them therapeutically in the rearing of agricultural animals, there is also a risk of their being present."
"That is what we do in the EU, and it undermines our credibility and our opposition to these hormones."
"That is why, in principle, they should really be comprehensively banned in these contexts."
"If we had banned them completely, as proposed by our committee, it would have been almost possible to exclude them from the market."
"There would then have been no danger of their being used in the wrong way."
"The committee was in agreement - as was Parliament, mainly, at first reading - about proceeding in this way."
"This is, however, an issue that needs to be solved."
"Even if I had full support for my desire for a total ban, I personally realised that it might be sensible to try to reach a compromise."
"I therefore contacted my fellow MEPs in the other political groups and said that we should perhaps try, for the fact of the matter was that the Council said that it wanted to retain the substances for three reasons: firstly, to induce rutting in cattle, which is the most important area of usage; secondly, for foetus maceration and mummification, also mainly in the case of cattle; and, thirdly, for pyometra in cattle."
"Of these areas of use, the first is the main one and the other two of relatively little importance."
"The latter two are, moreover, relatively important from the point of view of animal protection."
"Animals suffer if they cannot be given this medicine in the present situation."
"Even though there are alternatives, they were not believed to be accessible throughout the EU."
"My proposal, which became our proposal following contact with the other political groups, was that we should propose to the Council that the substances be kept for the purposes of the two less important areas relating to dead foetuses and pyometra."
"The Council accepted this, and we shall now be able to do away with use of the substances for inducing rutting, something I consider to be major progress."
"There will certainly be a transitional period, but then they will have been dispensed with."
"In the final proposal, we now say, moreover, that the second use too should be reviewed, and perhaps that too could be removed after a certain period."
"I see this as major progress, and we can thus perhaps solve the problem."
"I am extremely pleased that we in the committee have been able to unite in supporting the proposal, and I hope that this will also be the case in the vote in the Chamber tomorrow."
"We shall therefore be able to phase out the main use and thus strengthen our hand in the dispute with the United States."
"I therefore want to reinforce this compromise, which is certainly weaker than what Parliament previously put forward but is still sufficiently sound for us now to be able to find a solution to the problem."
"."
"Mr President, I welcome this joint debate, which covers three important legislative dossiers on which we are close to agreement following constructive interinstitutional dialogue."
"I will address each dossier in turn."
"I would like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mrs Klaß, Mrs Ayuso González and Mr Olsson, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for their hard work on these legislative dossiers."
"I will start with Mrs Klaß's recommendation for second reading."
"The adoption of this proposal on foodstuffs labelling legislation, to which we are very close, will be of great benefit to consumers."
"The common position represents a balanced compromise, including the majority of the measures proposed by the Commission, whilst restricting the scope of exemptions."
"It also reflects the European Parliament's wish to increase the accuracy of the information on foodstuffs labelling."
"The common position includes - either word for word or in substance - Parliament's four amendments as set out by the Commission in its amended proposal."
"It also takes into account most of the other Parliament amendments on three important points."
"First, the flexibility in the ingredient listing and the exemptions from the obligation to indicate the components of certain compound ingredients will apply from 2%, rather than the 5% initially proposed."
"Second, the review and update of the list of allergenic ingredients to reflect scientific advances."
"Moreover, when the list is updated, ingredients may be removed if there is scientific evidence to show that they are no longer allergenic."
"Third, the addition of celery and mustard and their derived products to the list of allergenic substances."
"However, one question is not completely settled."
"There is no available scientific basis that demonstrates either that the derivatives of certain allergens are still allergenic, or that they are no longer likely to cause adverse reactions."
"Thus the question arises: should we require mandatory labelling of those derivatives?"
"The common position includes mandatory labelling, but states also that these substances could be exempted in the future, should scientific evidence provide justification for such action."
"I share the view of the rapporteur and the committee that this might not be the best solution, but I do not agree with that suggested by Amendment Nos 1 and 2."
"Indeed, Amendment No 1 states that, for alcoholic drinks, derivatives should be labelled only if they are present in an amount which scientific research has shown may cause allergic reactions."
"This is not acceptable because science only provides evidence that allergens and their derivatives cause allergic reactions. No scientific data are available on what residual amount of a given allergen may trigger an allergic reaction."
"Furthermore, the amendment would be impossible to implement and the burden of proof is reversed."
"It is for the manufacturers to provide evidence that the specific allergen derivative they use is not likely to cause an adverse reaction in order to be exempted from indicating it on the label."
"Amendment No 2, in its first part, is identical to Amendment No 1, but concerns foodstuffs other than alcoholic beverages."
"It also expressly exempts the processing aids used in alcoholic beverages from labelling, while these are not covered in this paragraph of the common position."
"It is, therefore, not acceptable."
"Amendment No 3 requests the Commission to adopt, before 1 January 2004, following an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority, a list of derivatives that should be considered as non-allergenic."
"This goes in the right direction but, in addition to the unrealistic deadline, it is not acceptable as such because only studies conducted under the responsibility of the industry, on specific allergens' derivatives used in specific circumstances, could be considered and submitted for an opinion from the EFSA - for example, fish gelatine used as clarifying agent in beer."
"That is why only Amendment No 4, which constitutes a workable and reasonable compromise, can be accepted."
"I will now turn to Mrs Ayuso González's first reading report."
"In December 2002 the Commission adopted a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners."
"The main objective of this proposal is to adapt Directive 95/2/EC in the light of recent technical and scientific developments and to ensure the functioning of the internal market, a high level of protection of human health and the protection of consumers' interests."
"To this end, the Commission proposes to authorise a new food additive, to withdraw the authorisations for the use of some food additives, to revise current authorisations and to harmonise the use of food additives in flavourings at Community level."
"In particular, on the 'use of food additives in flavourings', the proposal is in the interests of consumers and industry as it would achieve harmonisation of this sector at Community level."
"A package of compromise amendments has been tabled, following close contact between the various institutions."
"COREPER has marked its agreement to this compromise package, to which I gladly add the Commission's support."
"I will now turn to the last of the legislative dossiers, Mr Olsson's second reading recommendation on hormones."
"I very much welcome the progress made."
"The debate on hormones has proved to be as delicate as the hormonal balance controlling the physiological functions in living creatures."
"As you know, the Commission initially proposed to prohibit the use of oestradiol in the light of advice that this endogenously produced substance is a carcinogen."
"Parliament supported this."
"However, intricate discussions in the Council - which took more than two years, spanned four presidencies and included two extra background reports - have demonstrated that prohibiting oestradiol is not as straightforward as was first imagined."
"Member States have drawn attention to the significant difficulties likely to arise from a prohibition, in particular the distress that this may cause with respect to animal welfare and the reorganisation of stockbreeding."
"We therefore had to reconsider, by asking ourselves: what are our objectives?"
"They are, firstly, to protect consumer health and, secondly, to achieve compliance with WTO requirements."
"According to the Commission's analysis both objectives can be achieved with the compromise proposed today by the rapporteur, Mr Olssen, and his colleagues, to whom I offer my sincere thanks."
"The adoption of this text with Amendment Nos 17, 18 and 19 would result in a significant reduction in the use of oestradiol."
"Moreover, it clearly distinguishes the three remaining uses from the use of oestradiol for growth promotion."
"It will, therefore, allow the Community to implement its international obligations in the context of the World Trade Organisation."
"Therefore, I look forward to the debate on these interesting and important issues."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it will be no surprise to you when I say that I would of course have preferred it if the three fine amendments adopted - admittedly by a small majority, but adopted nonetheless - in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had been made use of."
"Things being as they are, and politics being the art of the possible, I would, however, like to make it plain to you that this House cannot be expected to co-decide on a European directive that demands that winemakers and brewers should indicate on the bottle label that these beverages were produced using fish and eggs."
"That, though, would have happened had we approved the Common Position without the amendments tabled by our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß."
"To her I would like to extend the warmest thanks for her tireless efforts at bringing to the light of day a well thought-out directive, one that will of course ensure that, where potentially-allergenic ingredients - and I say ingredients rather than processing aids - are present, that presence is required to be indicated on a label."
"Wine and beer, however, do not contain such allergy-triggering ingredients."
"There is no doubt that their manufacture and processing involves the use of traces of processing aids described in Annex IIIa as having allergenic potential, these being isinglass and egg derivatives as clarifiers and fining agents."
"They help in technical processes such as filtering."
"The crucial difference from conventional additives is that processing aids are removed after use, and things that are not present in wine or beer do not have to be declared on the list of ingredients."
"That is the solution that this House adopted at first reading."
"I am convinced that the ministers responsible would, if they had known what is at stake, have followed this House's wise and far-sighted lead and would have put a proper Common Position before us."
"We know for certain that the presence in the end product of traces of the aids used cannot be scientifically demonstrated, even though, in such small quantities, they are unlikely to trigger allergies."
"Until such time as that is sorted out, there must be no labelling of such a nature as to mislead consumers, arouse unwarranted fears and do indefensible harm to major sectors of industry."
"That is why our approval of our rapporteur's compromise motion represents the outermost limit of what we can tolerate, and beyond that we cannot go."
"Commissioner, as you did not give Mrs Klaß an answer, I will ask you once more: is it indeed the case that studies may be submitted nine months after the directive enters into force?"
"This is something that must be clarified now, or else the rapporteur will have to speak for another few minutes."
"Mrs Lulling, you were allocated two minutes by the sittings directorate, and you have talked for three minutes and 26 seconds."
"In the absence of your fellow Member, Mr Goodwill, your speaking time was extended to three minutes, but not to three minutes 26."
"You will understand that I am obliged to be very firm, unless I want everyone to go to bed at 2 a.m."
"I thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, successive food scandals have undermined consumer confidence."
"Furthermore, food safety will be a burning political issue from now on, becoming an integral element in the overall safety of citizens."
"As a result, it is considered essential to provide extensive information on the ingredients of foodstuffs."
"Precise and relevant labelling, then, is indispensable, especially for ingredients which may cause allergies."
"The problem is relatively simple for those allergens actually present in the final product."
"Is it reasonable, on the other hand, to demand the inclusion on labels of ingredients such as technological aids, used especially in the production of alcoholic drinks, which constitute part of the production process but are not present in the finished product?"
"Since the best is always the enemy of the good, are we not in danger, in our commendable desire to protect allergy sufferers, of weakening traditional production methods through such measures, even causing markets to go bust, with no scientific proof of the harmful character of these aids?"
"One can well imagine the horror of consumers when they discover that sulphites and other unappetising ingredients are used in the production of wines as prestigious as champagne, or those of this beautiful region, Alsace, to name but a few."
"I am therefore glad that a balanced compromise has been found on this controversial question."
"The compromise states that it will be possible to withdraw certain ingredients from the list of allergens on the evidence of a scientifically-researched dossier, pending a full scientific study."
"Coming from a wine-producing region, of course, I would have preferred it if the burden of proof - in other words, the production of the technical dossier - did not fall on the shoulders of producers who are sometimes small operators."
"I am aware, however, that if we did not accept this compromise, we would have to ratify the Council's common position, which makes no provision for a procedure for exempting ingredients from the list of allergens."
"For these reasons, although my feelings are mixed, I believe that it is advisable to adopt this compromise."
"At the same time, I express the hope that the Commission will allow small - and medium-sized producers the flexibility they need in order to make their arguments heard."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens can by and large support the Kla? report."
"We believe in particular that industry must prove that a substance is non-allergenic."
"That has fortunately been retained in the compromise."
"As regards the Olsson report the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the compromise."
"Just like Mr Olsson we would of course have preferred to ban all growth promoters, but there are in particular animal welfare reasons for making a few limited exceptions nonetheless."
"We are glad that there will be more research into safety and into efficient alternatives, so that eventually we can move away from them altogether."
"We have a whole lot more difficulty with the Ayuso González report."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would go much further."
"Many of these additives and all those substances are unnecessary as far as we are concerned."
"With the precautionary principle in mind, parabens, polysorbates and aluminium phosphates should be banned immediately."
"We will however assent to the compromise because it is a step forward compared with the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Klaß, who has worked very competently on this report and shown herself capable of weighing up both the advantages and the negative consequences of systematic labelling regulations."
"She has fought her corner and defended her case against some of her collaborators, notably the Commission, which was not predisposed to listen to the demands of the elected Members of this House."
"Mrs Klaß's report, as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, was the best solution in my view, speaking as an eagle-eyed native of Champagne."
"Certain higher and sometimes contradictory interests, however, could not be ignored, and we thus decided on a fallback solution."
"In a sense, I had already proposed that solution anyway, in the amendments I tabled in committee, but I had then rallied round, without enthusiasm, to the solution advocated by the rapporteur."
"Today, part of me is happy that a partial solution has been taken up and reworked to satisfy the majority of us."
"Ensuring clear and relevant information as well as a certain level of protection for consumers suffering from allergies makes good sense to me."
"On the other hand, alarmist labelling would terrify consumers who suffer from allergies and reduce their own consumption."
"Iconic European drinks such as champagne or Irish beer would suffer terribly from this, Commissioner, dragging the whole European wine industry down with them."
"Tomorrow, before representatives of the wine industry of my region, Champagne-Ardennes, I am going to have to defend the established principle that it is the responsibility of producers great and small to prove that derivatives of supposedly allergenic products used by them as technological aids in wine are not themselves allergens, because they are the result of an important process of transformation of raw materials and operate in a totally different context, that of wine or beer."
"All of this alters their characteristics fundamentally."
"Brewers will thus have to prove that isinglass, used for centuries in beer-making, is not a proscribed product."
"In short, the burden of proof falls on their shoulders, but we have bought some time to do the relevant research."
"I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur and supporting the solution proposed in Amendment No 4."
"The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has moreover co-signed the compromise amendment and assumes the consequences of that choice."
"Mr President, the three reports which are now the subjects of a joint debate are important items of focus in our endeavours to ensure food safety and consumer welfare."
"I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent work."
"In the single market consumers encounter new and strange products and manufacturers on the shelves of their own familiar local shop every day, and they must be able to have complete confidence in quality control and food safety in that single market."
"It is regrettable that whenever the EU is proactive in setting such important standards, this is so often felt to be needless concern over details."
"One cause of that, of course, is the way the European press often deliberately sets out to portray things in a negative light, and disregarding the real problem at issue."
"The reasons for this are not political; they are to do with journalism."
"Stories need colour, and, unfortunately, that colour is often acquired by spreading scare stories instead of factual information."
"The latest example of this is the news story about limiting the maximum amounts for PAH compounds in foods to protect consumers' health."
"A totally legitimate research project carried out by the Commission has, at least in the Finnish newspapers, already developed into a scare about whether the EU is now going to ban private barbecues and our favourite summer treat, the grilled sausage."
"There has been continual whining about the EU meddling in everything and being overly protective, and they have been asking when the Europolice are going to start lighting bonfires piled with dangerous cookery books and whether soon we will have to eat wearing a helmet on our head, just to be on the safe side."
"Unfortunately, the nation swallows whole the scare stories spread in this way without any justification, giving rise to negative feelings and resentment."
"For that reason it would be important if the good work done in Parliament to protect people's health also had more vigorous support from the EU Information Centres."
"It is obviously necessary to provide background information early on at the preparatory stage so that the unsubstantiated urban legends about the EU do not get a chance to take root."
"Mr President, I must firstly convey my special thanks to Mrs Ayuso, the Commission and the Council for cooperating so well on the current proposal and compromise concerning additives, so that we might conclude this matter no later than at first reading."
"I suppose our package permits the further use of additives, but it has been quite crucial for me that we are now also putting the emphasis on the Commission's supervision and re-evaluation of the use of previously approved substances."
"I hope that we do not continue with the policy of just going on accepting new additives and an extended use of already approved substances so that such additives and substances are only omitted from the list when the industry itself informs us that they are no longer used."
"I think that the policy so far has been unduly defensive."
"In my opinion, the Commission should constantly inspect and re-evaluate the use of additives so that the three well-known conditions for using them are fully complied with at all times."
"I am therefore very pleased about the provisions in the package whereby the Commission must, within two years, present an overall report on the re-evaluation of additives and whereby this report must promptly focus especially upon the use of certain types, including nitrates, nitrites and polysorbates."
"I hope that tomorrow's adoption of the reports and the process leading to approval of the package may herald a better policy on the use of additives in food."
"I should also like to take the opportunity of thanking Mr Olsson for his really constructive cooperation in connection with banning the use of hormones in animal husbandry."
"In this area too, we are now obtaining a result in which the use of the carcinogenic hormone, oestradiol 17? will cease in the course of two years. In other words, hormones in general will cease to be used in animal husbandry."
"This is a sound and very positive result that Mr Olsson has piloted through."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate the three rapporteurs, among whom I would like to single out Mrs Klaß, whose report demonstrates some very good ways of approaching this issue."
"I know from my own personal experience the different preconceptions that have to be taken into account when considering issues of labelling."
"I would particularly like to highlight the rules on labelling for products that trigger allergic reactions."
"In the European Union, 8% of children and 3% of adults suffer an allergic reaction to food ingredients to such an extent that it markedly affects their general state of health, and that is an alarming statistic."
"When it comes to keeping consumers informed, labelling is the only option in view of the large number of compound foodstuffs, the composition of which changes frequently."
"Unlike the previous speakers, I am in favour of the continued addition of ingredients that, it simply has to be said, improve the quality of the meal."
"That products should be listed only if there is scientific evidence that they trigger allergies goes without saying; we should also ensure that the list can be amended quickly when new findings come to light."
"It should always be borne in mind that the plethora of information on a label has to communicate the essentials."
"In this perspective, I look forward with keen anticipation to learning what the Commission thinks about the inclusion on labels of, for example, unproven assertions."
"This is where there could well be a reduction in the amount of information provided."
"May I just make one additional observation?"
"In 1998, as a rapporteur, I tried to bring in rules on the labelling of alcoholic drinks; the sole issue then was the labelling of sulphur."
"What was, at that time, seen as revolutionary is now no longer an issue; proof that Parliament has, in recent years, come round much more to the consumers' way of thinking."
"Furthermore, I welcome the proposal for labelling where the proportion of an ingredient is in excess of 2%."
"Although this was, years ago, regarded as impossible, and may well not be necessary, we are now taking account of the tendency to use many ingredients in small quantities in the production process, and we are discharging our obligation to inform the consumer."
"Businesses with whom I have had discussions have told me that most labels now include ingredients the proportion of which is under 2%."
"I would just like to make a brief comment on the Olsson report;"
"I welcome Mr Olsson's accommodating approach and see it as a good thing, but I am also aware that oestradiol 17? is already being replaced by other substances in many countries in the European Union."
"That is something that we should be encouraging and promoting."
"I really must insist that Members observe the limits on their speaking time."
"I cannot extend every Member's speaking time by half, or we will not sleep tonight."
"Would the Commission like to say anything more?"
"Very briefly, I was asked a question in relation to Amendment No 4, and perhaps I might just give some clarification to that on the Klaß report."
"I believe the Amendment No 4 compromise is quite clear."
"The industry can notify the studies for existing derivative products for a period of nine months after the entry into force of the directive."
"The Commission will finally need to decide, at the latest four years after the entry into force, whether a derivative will need to be labelled or not."
"The Commission will decide on the basis of the studies, after the consultation that is envisaged with the European Food Safety Authority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the point at issue is that the wording in the compromise is 'studies currently in progress', and I stressed in my speech the fact that these things have not been researched before."
"If our new directive leads industry to consider requesting a study, is it possible that it is only now that I would commission one?"
"That was the question - not whether current studies would be taken into account, but whether it is possible that future studies will be."
"One final response, perhaps, Commissioner?"
"The compromise that was reached related to studies for existing derivative products; that was for a period of nine months after the entry into force of the directive."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"- (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the second reading I should like to revisit a number of important points from my report."
"I do not wish to do so however without first thanking my fellow Members."
"The shadow rapporteurs have been especially helpful."
"At this point I would also like to direct a word of thanks to the industry."
"We had the opportunity of holding intensive discussions, not only with the packaging industry, but also with the packers and the environmental groups."
"This gave rise to heated discussions and it increased my understanding of actual practice."
"These discussions have convinced me that we must start looking at packaging differently."
"For a long time it has been self-evident to see packaging as an environmental problem, a small and necessary problem certainly, but a problem nonetheless."
"We can also see packaging in a positive light by looking at it in conjunction with the product."
"Packaging then becomes the protector of the product and prevents waste."
"Packaging is also the vehicle of globalisation, of world trade and of socio-economic development."
"Seen in this light sustainable development is no longer possible without packaging."
"A positive way of thinking about packaging however is only credible if we go all out to prevent environmental pollution."
"Which is why recycling and prevention are necessary."
"I shall turn to them briefly now."
"First of all recycling. This is an important part of the directive."
"Some even maintain that really the packaging directive is first and foremost a recycling directive."
"In the debates during the first reading I pointed out that recycling is not a goal in itself and that there are also limits to the environmental benefit of recycling."
"During the second reading we were mainly concerned with the costs of recycling."
"The British Government in particular is concerned about the extra costs of more recycling and published figures on this."
"What remains unclear however is the way in which the costs have been calculated."
"Recycling costs money, but it does produce something as well."
"The greater the scale, the more cost-effective, but there are limits of course."
"If you want to collect the last tin in the north of Finland, that does of course cost a disproportionate amount of money."
"Our discussion about the environmental benefit in the first reading and the economic costs in the second almost inevitably lead to the conclusion that the optimum percentage could vary substantially from one country to another."
"The discussion was indeed more of a discussion between countries than between political groups."
"Ultimately we are going to have to work towards each country finding and fulfilling its own optimum."
"But that is only possible if sufficient recycling capacity has already been created in each country."
"That is why we need clear objectives now."
"We must certainly not set the bar too low, nor too high, nor too close, nor too far away."
"We need a good middle position."
"I therefore call on you to support the compromise that the groups have reached."
"This compromise is 55% in 2007."
"In passing I note that we are therefore later than the original Commission proposal, because that was 55% in 2006."
"It is very important to set ambitious but achievable targets for the new Member States as well."
"They must themselves be involved with this."
"Waste and recycling have become global markets."
"There is no objection to the export of sorted waste, but we must be sure that it has indeed been sorted and that it is indeed being properly processed in developing world countries."
"The exporter must prove this."
"Prevention."
"Prevention still receives too little attention i n the packaging directive."
"We have to do something about producer responsibility."
"We have done so previously in the electronic waste directive and the end-of-life vehicles directive."
"The responsibility of producers here is not just financial."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy demands better implementation of the essential requirements and asks producers to choose the most environmentally friendly alternative."
"It is a good idea to set up an indicator for this."
"Different materials such as paper, metal, glass and plastic must compete on an environmental quality basis."
"This will provide an incentive for constant innovation in the environmental field. And there is an incentive to invest in recycling capacity."
"It will lead to every country having optimum recycling capacity because every material producer will have an interest in recycling."
"The introduction of an indicator is also a way of giving consumers greater involvement with packaging and of giving supermarkets or businesses the opportunity only to choose five-star packaging for example."
"In this way sustainable development is something that concerns all of us."
"This approach fits in perfectly with the sixth environmental action programme."
"I would like to draw your attention to two further points. Firstly, re-use."
"Discussion of this topic has gained fresh momentum since Germany made deposit systems compulsory on 1 January."
"Complaints are pouring in about this because of the distortion of the internal market."
"Deposit systems can indeed conflict with the internal market."
"It is a pity that the Commission has not seized upon the revision as an opportunity to do something about the long list of complaints."
"It is also a pity that no majority was to be found in the first reading for the amendment to create clarity."
"We must prevent improper utilisation of re-use and therefore we must put the environmental result first here too."
"The second point that I would like to make concerns ceramics. I have a question for the Commission about this."
"The ceramics industry is concerned about the effects of the packaging directive and is seeking total exemption."
"There are two points on which I would like a clear statement from the Commission."
"Firstly, in my view it is not advantageous for the ceramics industry to fall completely outside the packaging directive - this directive does after all provide the basis for trade in the internal market."
"Commissioner, what is your opinion on this?"
"Secondly, I would like clarity as to whether the ceramics industry will have a recycling obligation by 2007."
"In my view it will not, but on this too I would like confirmation from the Commission."
"Before giving the floor to the Commissioner, I would remind those of my fellow Members who have just rejoined us for this new debate that we have an extraordinarily full agenda this evening."
"So that the last few Members, speaking on the last few reports, do not have to watch the sun rise from this room, I would ask speakers to keep to the time allotted to them."
". I thank Ms Corbey for her work as rapporteur on this subject."
"I know she has done a very serious job and looked at this in depth."
"In 1999 a total amount of 63.5 million tonnes of packaging waste was generated in the European Union."
"This corresponds to around 17% of municipal solid waste and 3% of the total waste generation by weight."
"The packaging and packaging waste directive has made the collection and recycling of packaging waste a normal activity in all EU Member States, increasingly so also in the accession countries."
"In this way the directive has helped to reduce environmental impacts and to strengthen the internal market for packaging and packaging waste."
"This revision builds on this success."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament has, since the first reading, given clear support for our proposal to more than double the minimum recycling targets and to further increase the recovery target."
"It seems that there is now widespread agreement on the levels of the targets."
"The key remaining question is whether the implementation deadline will be 2008, as in the common position, or whether an earlier date should be set."
"In my view deadlines should be both realistic and ambitious."
"It will also be important to give Greece, Ireland and Portugal - Member States already granted later target dates under current legislation - a reasonable time to adapt to the new targets."
"This also applies to the accession states."
"I intend to propose deadlines for these countries before the end of this year."
"I am also pleased that Parliament largely agrees that other aspects - in particular, prevention and re-use - should be further studied before new decisions are taken."
"However, the need for further analysis also applies to the new obligation referred to in the first part of Amendment No 7."
"This new obligation to minimise the environmental impact of packaging risks duplicating the existing essential requirements and facing the same problems in regard to enforcement."
"I fully understand the concerns of Parliament regarding exports for recycling."
"I agree that we should make sure that recycling in non-EU countries should only count for our targets if it is done properly."
"However, controls and paperwork should be focused on where they are really needed."
"I do not see any reason why this should apply to materials such as metals, paper and glass."
"These materials are part of a functioning, internal, international market."
"I doubt that we need written proof of the recycling of each exported batch."
"It would also seem strange to me to apply stricter controls on exports of packaging waste than the provisions on waste electrical and electronic equipment, which we decided just a few months ago."
"There seems to be a great deal of concern in Parliament - as we just heard from the rapporteur - about the effect of the packaging directive on ceramics packaging."
"Let me be clear that nothing in the directive obliges Member States to set up recycling systems for this type of packaging."
"Excluding ceramics from the scope of the packaging directive raises the question of why we should exclude ceramics and not other, similar packaging types."
"It also gives Member States the freedom to take any measure on ceramics packaging, as long as it is within the framework of the Treaty."
"Therefore I believe it is better to ask the Technical Committee to solve any possible implementation problems, rather than excluding ceramics from the scope of the directive."
"I know that flower pots, self-adhesive labels and related issues are important for the industries concerned."
"Therefore they merit a proper discussion."
"Conciliation is, in my view, not the right framework for such a discussion."
"This is a job for detailed work by the experts in the Technical Committee."
"Of the 32 amendments the Commission can accept 20 amendments in full, in part, or in principle."
"A list of the amendments concerned has been handed over separately"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the modification of the directive on packaging is going to have enormous repercussions for the various agents, local councils, collection systems, companies producing materials, the food industry and consumers."
"It is clear that we must set quantitative objectives and that these must be ambitious but, at the same time, they must be achievable."
"We must not forget the fact that in certain Member States the objectives will be more difficult to achieve for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructure, low population density or consumer habits."
"I regret not having been able to reach a full agreement with the rapporteur, but I believe that her work has not been at all easy."
"In the report which she presented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy there were many points on which we were in agreement, but Mrs Corbey wanted to go further and, after having reached a compromise, at the last minute she has introduced modifications in Amendments Nos 26 and 27 which have obliged me not to sign them and to vote against them tomorrow."
"I understand that in countries such as Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands the collection of waste is cheap and efficient."
"In these countries there is a uniform distribution of population and no geographical barriers."
"But it is not logical to impose the same objectives on other Member States which do not have a similar distribution of population."
"And I am not just talking about my country, Spain, but also Finland, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom and other Member States which are going to have great difficulties fulfilling the objectives agreed in the common position."
"And this is not a problem of a lack of investment on the part of public administrations."
"There are 41 million of us living in Spain, half the population of Germany, in an area of 504 000 km2."
"The population is distributed around the most mountainous rural environment in the whole of the European Community."
"Can anyone believe that the collection of waste can be carried out on equal terms?"
"We need a realistic, flexible and, above all, applicable directive."
"It appears that some people want to gear this directive towards their own laws and impose it on the other Member States. This is neither fair, logical nor equitable."
"I believe that the Council's common position is pretty balanced."
"I fully support the dates and the quantitative objectives set in it."
"My only regret is that there are not equal objectives for all materials and that, as a result of economic interests, we have forgotten that there are problems with the functioning of the internal market, which is the real reason for this Directive."
"I believe it is very important that we support the various different options for dealing with waste: re-use, recycling and energy recovery."
"These three options are better than merely depositing waste in dumps."
"Finally, we must bear in mind that packaging waste represents a relatively small proportion of all waste generated in the Member States, 3% according to you, Commissioner."
"So let us be flexible."
"Industry is making great efforts as are the agents involved."
"Mr President, it is important to improve on the present Directive on packaging waste, as has been said here in several speeches."
"The targets for recycling and re-use for the next five years in the form now proposed are fairly high but are by no means unreasonable."
"Many Member States have already achieved considerably higher levels than those now being proposed."
"These suggested targets are easily achievable, and if we had less ambitious targets, then any branch of industry, for example, which would exploit the use of recycled material, could not develop."
"In order to reach the targets, however, we should bear in mind the excellent measures that have already been implemented in different Member States to achieve the greatest possible targets for recycling and re-use."
"For example, countries that have good experience of re-use projects should also be encouraged even further in this area."
"Just as the rapporteur stated, economic and ecological factors must be taken into consideration in this connection."
"I would therefore like to draw attention to the fact that, as recycling targets are being proposed for wood, it is these very ecological and economic factors that have not necessarily been taken into consideration."
"The 15% target for wood is a low one, but in a country like Finland, for example, the ecological disadvantages of transportation greatly outweigh the benefits gained from recycling wood in this way."
"It is a lot wiser ecologically if this wood is burnt as an energy source in people's houses."
"I therefore hope that common sense will prevail and that Amendment No 26, which is a proposal put forward by the rapporteur and others, will be supported."
"Mr President, in brief, since I can do little more within one minute, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for seeking a compromise which has led to 11 amendments being signed, the majority of them, by several groups, for the revision of this Directive."
"I would also like to point out that this proposal represents the fulfilment of one of the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and say, like the rapporteur, that the objectives of the proposal are ambitious but achievable, as certain Member States are demonstrating by already complying with certain aspects of this Directive on packaging and packaging waste."
"We must place particular emphasis on compliance with the Directive (one of the most serious problems we are facing is very frequent non-compliance with Community environmental legislation)."
"We must stress the need to ensure that exporters carry out the process of recovery or recycling under conditions which are not merely similar to those laid down in Community legislation, but exactly equivalent to them."
"Finally, Mr President, we must also act quickly to guarantee the selection at origin of materials that create less waste, are less harmful and reduce waste as much as possible, since that waste has increased over recent years in the majority of Member States."
"Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, on her approach."
"The principle underlying this legislation is limitation of the harmful environmental consequences of packaging."
"The way in which the targets formulated are achieved may differ from one Member State to another."
"Unfortunately, we have to say that the European Commission thinks differently about this, witness the fact that on 17 December last year it decided to summon the Netherlands to appear before the Court. And this while the targets are being amply achieved in the Netherlands through the operation of a voluntary agreement between the Ministry for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and industry."
"This approach will also have to be recognised in this directive."
"In compromise Amendment No 31 this has been done, although I still find the requirements very tight."
"I recognise that the targets of this directive may be ambitious, but nonetheless this matter must not end in conciliation, certainly not if there is agreement with the Council on the other points."
"I can for example give my unqualified support to the idea that the export of packaging waste may only count towards the achievement of the targets if the exporter can supply the proof that the recovery and/or the recycling has taken place in circumstances that are equivalent to the community regulation."
"I am less happy with the fact that the discussion of mechanical recycling is again being deferred, so that we continue to be faced with a lack of clarity."
"Finally, Mr President, I really do think that gift wrap should be covered by the definition of packaging."
"Mr President, I believe that the approach of this directive is out of date."
"That is confirmed by the Commission's recently published Thematic Strategy on Recycling."
"This now says: 'Current directives foresee that all Member States should achieve the same recycling targets as this one does."
"However, the question is legitimate whether this uniformity in targets is most effective, both from an environmental and economic point of view."
"It might be better to have an overall EU recycling target at EU level and let market forces determine which recycling facilities can achieve the objective in the most cost-effective manner.'"
"How right that is!"
"We know that there are some Member States that want to go beyond the proposed targets. Others will find them impossible to meet."
"So why are we ploughing on with a strategy that is already being undermined by the practicalities?"
"The United Kingdom has a problem with this."
"For many years we have relied on landfill."
"Our geology favoured that."
"We consequently had no particular incentive to press ahead with recycling, as some countries did."
"We are now moving as fast as we can, but there is no way that we can move as fast as the rapporteur's amendments prescribe."
"To do that would mean spending EUR 1.8 billion on recycling packaging waste alone, and packaging waste is only 6% of the waste going to landfill in Britain."
"This would mean that we would have to tell British local councils to initiate policies to remove packaging from the household waste stream."
"That takes time and money, Mrs Corbey."
"Maybe such policies are not the most pressing priorities of my country's local authorities."
"Maybe their priority is financing home helps, Meals on Wheels for the elderly or services of another kind."
"If subsidiarity is to mean anything at all, such priorities should be for local decision."
"How can I defend a situation where a combination of continental MEPs press for changes that will supply an imperative to British local authorities that a majority of British MEPs have not voted for?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the work she has done on this report and on the proposals that are on the table."
"We have just heard how the way we deal with packaging has a decisive part to play in shaping the future of our environment, and how there is - of course - a market in this field, one in which the big packaging groups are competing with one another, so that we have to give some thought as to how we achieve an optimum level of effectiveness."
"Within this market there are specialities, which represent the opportunities offered by diversity in Europe."
"Where these are concerned we have stressed the need for this great pot to safeguard the interests, futures and chances of survival of the small firms, scattered throughout Europe, working in the ceramics sector and producing highly-prized packaging such as that for Meaux mustard and similar goods. To describe them as an industry would be an exaggeration, in that they have between 30 and 50 workers each."
"It is for this reason that the keynote of our amendments is that the directive should not cover packaging materials which cannot be utilised for energy recovery owing to their material quality, which are inert, and the quantities of which do not exceed 0.1% of the proven quantity of packaging in the Community, and for which material or raw material recycling is ruled out for ecological and cost-benefit reasons."
"We have just heard from the Commissioner - and for this we are grateful - that the packaging directive's recycling order will not apply to ceramics."
"There must, of course, be a place for ceramics in the packaging directive, but recycling it would mean that it would have to be transported back across Europe, in minimal quantities, in order for this to be done."
"Systems for its return, collection and recovery would have to be introduced."
"That would kill off small businesses."
"We cannot believe that Europe is about enacting directives that cut away the economic basis from under small firms that offer speciality goods that are highly prized in Europe."
"I thank you for your unambiguous statement, which is something we can build on, and which will also give the firms a certain amount of breathing space and a reliable prospect of future development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although I often agree with you, this is one occasion when I do not, as I take the view that you ought to have intervened at a much earlier stage."
"I have just heard impressive speeches to the effect that equal quotas in Europe are unfair."
"At that, I cannot but laugh; why, then do we have them?"
"In Europe, we have to have comparable rules, and the ground rules have to be interpreted in such a way that the Member States can make a start."
"I was here in 1994 - as was Mrs Jackson - when we adopted the directive."
"If my schoolboy maths serves me well, that was twelve years ago."
"There are Member States that, since that day, have simply sat with their arms folded and done nothing whatever."
"This morning, I was at a big event in Frankfurt, along with several hundred others."
"They gave me a good telling-off and said to me, 'Florenz, why are we, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in a number of Nordic countries, keeping in step and implementing these rules, while, elsewhere, they are doing nothing at all?"
"You are a poor representative of your country if you allow this sort of thing to go on'."
"I have to tell you, Commissioner, you are the guardian of the laws, and you have to intervene at a much earlier stage."
"Mrs Corbey, I see it as almost shameful that we should be starting a dispute in this House as to whether the starting date should be 2008 or 2007."
"That is not what all this is about!"
"What matters is that we should heighten awareness among the public and in the Member States of the fact that a recycling strategy means that resources are conserved, and that when we talk about the conservation of resources, we are talking about our children's capital."
"In Europe, that has to be organised on a Community basis."
"I very much sympathise with those who say 'yes' to this, but are worried about the export issue."
"With my liberal approach, I do not go as far as that, but when it comes to exports, we cannot have the situation in which enterprises here develop recycling strategies, and then export the materials."
"Such a thing would surely be false."
"While I, of course, have sympathy with Member States that sort out care for the elderly before dealing with the packaging directive, I do accept that this is the rule."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that we need this legislation: we are absolutely drowning in a sea of milk cartons, hair sprays, coke cans, pizza boxes, bottles of wine and shampoo."
"They are evident in every town, city and street we go into across the Union, in particular the UK."
"Landfills are reaching capacity, incinerators are overflowing and the wads of excessive packaging we use should go."
"This legislation, if it signals the end of just one elaborate box, fancy bottle or something wrapped in plastic and sold in a heavyweight bag, will have done its job."
"However, I would call on everyone here to recognise the importance of allowing time for change."
"Ministers are calling for a 2008 date for the UK and some of the other states."
"I would ask you to support that."
"Culture change takes time."
"The UK is meeting its existing recycling targets, but it is simply not possible to meet and implement this legislation by 2007 without an expensive, crash-spending programme."
"The figures do not look very significant, but they represent millions of tonnes of material which must be collected, recycled and new markets found."
"A realistic timetable for implementation is five years."
"Any attempt to compress this time will result in spiralling costs - if not quite as much as Mrs Jackson says."
"Nevertheless, we need time and we will do the job."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my heartfelt support for the proposal put by the rapporteur, who has worked with great dedication."
"I can understand the compromises that have been made."
"Not everyone can be equally tough."
"We must however in any event leave those who can be tougher, but who perhaps go about things differently, as in the Netherlands for example, with its voluntary agreement, in peace because they are achieving more than the others."
"That is why I, just like Mr Hans Blokland, am happy with the amendment to Paragraph 31."
"Everyone wants to achieve the targets in their own way."
"That does however mean that you must not distort the market in achieving those targets."
"Commissioner, I have a question for you about this."
"It has become apparent to us - and they are finding this very difficult in the area that I come from - that because of the way in which deposit money is levied on single-use packaging in Germany - and shortly in Belgium too - it has actually become impossible at the moment to continue importing single-use packaging from other European countries into Germany."
"What we have therefore is a trade embargo."
"Do you not think, Commissioner, that this way of achieving the target, namely the reduction of waste, which I am otherwise in favour of, is distorting the market through the imposition of an ecotax or deposit money?"
"And should that not be reason for you, perhaps in consultation with your colleague Mr Bolkestein, to take this up and in any event to give me an answer now?"
"What is your opinion on this and what steps must be taken to bring an end to this trade distortion, which has for that matter already led to job losses?"
"Mr President, key to the 1994 directive were targets for Member States for packaging recovery and recycling, to be set initially for a five-year phase and thereafter to be reviewed for subsequent five-year phases - and hence we are here today."
"I support the objective of this directive to minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste, as long as the costs are proportionate to the environmental benefits."
"It is often forgotten that packaging waste is only a small proportion of total landfill."
"The key concern in relation to the amendments to this directive is the deadline for achieving compliance with the proposed higher recovery and recycling targets."
"The deadline, or 'time-line', should be realistic, proportionate and achievable in line with best practice."
"This will allow infrastructure and recycling capacity to be built up at a pace that ensures progress with the objectives of the directive whilst not imposing excessive or disproportionate costs."
"I wish to draw attention to the derogation that sets the same recovery and recycling targets as for the other twelve Member States, but allows Ireland, Greece and Portugal longer to achieve them."
"I urge support for the common position, which sets an accepted deadline of 2012."
"There is an assumption that all Member States should ultimately reach the same recovery and recycling rates, irrespective of size, geography or infrastructure."
"It is not a question of having done nothing alone."
"Yes, far more could be done, but in Ireland's case we have a population of less than four million and too small a market to sustain a packaging manufacturing infrastructure."
"We import 75% of our packaged goods."
"There is one paper recycler, little plastics recycling, no metal recyclers and the only glass recycler in the country has recently closed down."
"Therefore we are at a permanent geographical and structural disadvantage."
"To comply with this directive we must ship packaging waste overseas or build more reprocessing facilities and export the empty packaging, which is uneconomic."
"The cost will not be proportional to the environmental benefit."
"I underline what Ms Jackson said to us, on the Commission's recent communication on the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, published in May 2003."
"From an environmental point of view it is more important to optimise collection and recycling in the Community as a whole, rather than to consider whether this takes place in a particular Member State."
"This should be reflected in the overall recycling target at Community level."
"In the Commissioner's own words, could she please explain how this squares with what we have here today?"
"Mr President, to her credit, the main thread of the rapporteur's argument has been the speedy revision of targets, thereby avoiding the temptation to embark on too large-scale and thorough a review now."
"There will be another time for that."
"I would like here to mention some of my own amendments, which were approved by the committee in the recommendation and also in the proposed inter-party compromises."
"If the targets are to be implemented we should avoid discrimination between materials on the basis of weight."
"That will not happen, however, if, for example, charges are based solely on weight and do not take account of each material's environmental impact."
"Clarification is needed to give proper shape to the whole programme."
"The very fact that there is an aim to recycle 55% by weight of packaging waste and an obligation that goes with it to take the environmental costs and benefits of the recovery and recycling of packaging materials into account means that there should be no one-sided increase in material-specific commitments, even if that would mean the 55% target would be achieved more quickly."
"The Commission has promised to present a report in 2005, one section of which is to be on the subject of re-use."
"My amendment proposes that that report should examine re-use and, in particular, a comparison of the ecological benefits of re-use and those of recycling."
"The report should focus precisely on real environmental impact and assessing market viability."
"Important details include examples in the Annex of products which constitute packaging that is not subject to the scope of this directive."
"These include tubes and cylinders around which flexible material is wound, release paper of self-adhesive labels, and wrapping and gift wrapping paper sold as a separate product."
"I want to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Corbey has presented for its second reading a report the essentials of which I can endorse."
"We need the best possible systems to deal with what amounts to some 58 million tonnes of packaging material produced every year in the European Union, an amount that is increasing from year to year."
"In so doing, we would be ensuring that the environment is better cared for and giving important sectors of industry the security to plan ahead."
"Among those we will be voting on tomorrow, there is one amendment that I regard as particularly important."
"Amendment No 4 has to do with packaging materials in small quantities, which are therefore subject to a very low market penetration in the Member States."
"One material that occurs in small quantities of this sort is ceramic packaging; for example, ceramic bottles, pots, and bowls made in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, are mainly used for the packaging of brandies, chocolates, and patés."
"Ceramic packaging accounts for only 0.1% of the packaging waste produced in the EU - in other words, just 58 000 tonnes out of 58 million tonnes."
"Ceramics consist of baked clay, and their artistic and creative appearance means that, in many households, they are kept or re-used, so that they do not end up in the household rubbish."
"Ceramics can be neither re-used in the production of energy nor recycled."
"They pose no problems for the environment."
"To treat ceramics separately, collecting them and transporting them thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense either in environmental or in economic terms."
"I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4."
"Waste management, which was already introduced on the basis of this directive, or which has yet to be introduced in certain Member States, should deal with those materials that are suited to recovery; it must concentrate on materials the collection and recycling of which is profitable in economic and environmental terms."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is no exaggeration, I feel, to state that tomorrow, when we approve the final version of the directive on emissions trading, we will have before us a new economic and environmental paradigm for the European Union: the carbon economy."
"Carbon will have a price per tonne on the market, and whoever can produce it with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions will reap the benefits."
"Approving this directive, then, has enormous political value: it lends credibility to our leadership on the world stage, which is crucial if we are to be able to convince Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol; from 2005 on, it will allow us to remedy the inadequate progress made by the majority of Member States towards compliance with Kyoto; and, most of all, it will reduce the financial cost of implementing Kyoto in the European Union by 35%."
"Although Parliament has welcomed the Commission's proposal from the start and believes it to be valuable, we also felt that its scope could have been more ambitious."
"I believe that this has been achieved with the recommendation for a second reading, agreed with the Greek Presidency, with the full cooperation of the Commission."
"We will vote on this recommendation tomorrow."
"This agreement brings two great advantages: firstly, it avoids conciliation, and hence the possible postponement of the launch of the scheme from 2005 until 2006; secondly, although it does not incorporate all the amendments tabled by Parliament, the compromise that was reached includes our most important proposals."
"Allow me to highlight the principal innovations introduced by this recommendation."
"Firstly, it defines a national ceiling for emissions allowances, in line with the Kyoto objectives. A quantified objective to be obtained by the system is thus guaranteed, and the risk of over-allocation avoided."
"Secondly, the temporary exclusion clause - the 'opt-out' - clause, will apply to installations but not to activities, thus assuring that the liquidity of the scheme and the equilibrium of the internal market will not be threatened."
"Thirdly, the scheme can be extended to amend the directive in other sectors, notably the transport, chemical and aluminium sectors."
"Fourthly, auctioning may now constitute part of the process by which emission allowances are allocated after the end of the first period, though unfortunately in a non-harmonised way."
"Fifthly, credits deriving from clean development projects and joint implementation of the Kyoto Protocol will be linked into this directive, but they will not replace the priority that should be given to domestic measures."
"Sixthly, an opt-in clause is included, permitting Member States to extend the system to other installations and activities."
"Seventhly, the system may be extended to greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide from the second period of the directive onwards, though on a voluntary basis."
"Eighthly, limits are then defined, with fixed and non-negotiable penalties for non-compliance."
"Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the inclusion of benchmarking criteria for allocating emissions allowances among the Member States."
"I feel, therefore, that the European emissions market has become more ambitious in environmental terms with this report. It is more effective economically, with lower risks of distortion of competition, and it is more compatible with other national policies currently in force."
"I would like to conclude, then, by thanking the Council, and the Greek Presidency in particular, for its cooperation. I would like to thank the Commission, whose arbitration between Council and Commission was exemplary."
"Most of all, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, because I believe that without their cooperation and support, Parliament could not have remained united. And without Parliament's unity, this agreement would not have been such a good one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have always been passionately in favour of voluntary agreements, and I accept that we lost them at first reading stage."
"That is why I am every bit as happy as you are about this marvellous package that Mr Moreira da Silva has put on the table after the most enormously hard work - something that I can confirm to my own group."
"I think we are on the right track."
"The reason why the compromise is so important is that, if we do not adopt it tomorrow, we will not know for some considerable time what will emerge from the conciliation procedure."
"Apart from that, I am quite certain that we will then waste another year, and that is precisely what we do not want."
"This really is about how future generations will live, and, although I am very keen on conciliation procedures, we should dispense with one and give the Council a great opportunity to follow where we lead."
"On this issue, the Olympic spirit is not enough; simply joining in is not on."
"All the Member States must make the utmost effort; even today, we can already see that some of them are having problems with this 'trend-line'."
"On that, Commissioner, I am again in agreement with you."
"You must see to it that they all play their part."
"Some will be able to do more than others; there is no doubt about that, but they must all join in, and then we will get the right result."
"I am, however, again astonished at how, silently and overnight, other sectors have been dropped from this directive."
"That was a first-class demonstration of the Member States' weakness and lack of courage when it came to developing an approach according to which both transport and personal house fires - such as we have in our own homes - would in future be covered by the Kyoto Protocol."
"I would very much have liked that, but it presupposes very tough politicians - of which there do not seem to be that many in the Council."
"I believe that we have made a good start by taking 1990 as the initial reference year, and I hope that, with joint implementation, and also with CDMs, we are on the right track."
"Even though we have not yet precisely defined the package, I do believe that we will, tomorrow, adopt it by a large majority."
"Many thanks, Mr Moreira da Silva."
"Mr President, first of all, a word of thanks to Mr Moreira da Silva."
"He has gone about his business with energy and tenacity."
"An energetic step to achieve the Kyoto targets is now of major importance."
"Uncertainty about Russian participation in Kyoto must not lead to paralysis."
"Climate change has major economic and social consequences."
"We must therefore take the steps to turn the tide now."
"Pollution must now acquire a price and that is an important tool for the preservation of industry."
"The PSE Group is in complete agreement with Mr Moreira da Silva's desire to reach an agreement in the second reading and appreciates all the efforts that have been made to this end."
"Unfortunately, we have to say that it has also been at the expense of our democratic procedures."
"Not all of the amendments have received an equal amount of attention in the negotiations with the Council."
"It is particularly disappointing for the PSE Group that the amendment on closures for instance failed to reach the finish line."
"There was very broad support for this amendment in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We saw in this amendment an important safeguard against improper closures."
"Kyoto must not be allowed to be a reason for closing businesses or moving them to a different part of the world and then selling the emission rights."
"This amendment was important for the employees in energy-intensive sectors."
"We cannot skate over it too lightly."
"Public support for a dynamic climate policy is sorely needed, because quite an effort is still going to be needed to achieve the Kyoto targets."
"I call on the Council and the Commission in any event to take account of closures in the allocation plans."
"In the event of closures the emission rights must be returned."
"The PSE Group is entirely satisfied on other points."
"We have always stressed that the system must also be fair and be experienced as fair."
"This is why we do not want any ceiling that prejudices Member States that have expanded their industry in recent years."
"We do however want a ceiling that slowly but surely brings Member States to reduce the emission of CO2."
"Nor do we want Member States that made an early start on innovation to be disadvantaged."
"That too is an important point for us."
"And finally, we do not want any superfluous bureaucracy."
"The allocation of emission rights is already complicated enough."
"We must not make it even more complicated by adding an auction for 5% on top."
"No one is served by an auction for 5% and in this way we would also tend to stimulate overallocation."
"In short, we are very satisfied with the outcome across the board and on this we congratulate Mr Moreira da Silva once more."
"We call for attention for the social implications of this directive and the PSE Group calls on the Member States to take this into account in the allocation plans."
"Mr President, Parliament can point to some real gains from the deal negotiated with the Council to fast-track this legislation and avoid the conciliation procedure."
"We can claim to enclose a number of possible loopholes."
"Member States will not be allowed to issue allowances that exceed their previously agreed targets, and they must not use the Kyoto mechanisms to avoid taking action to reduce emissions domestically."
"We look forward to the Commission coming back with plans to bring other greenhouse gases into the scheme and to extend its scope to include other industries."
"We await with keen anticipation the Commission's proposals to reduce emissions from the transport sector."
"Of course, we might have secured more, but speed is of the essence."
"We want this scheme to succeed, and if Member States are to start meeting their targets they must publish national allocation plans by March 2004."
"Several Member States have expressed serious concern about this legislation and this has been reflected within all our political groups."
"All those leading on the issue have faced a degree of resistance from some colleagues, but it is a tribute to the skill of our rapporteur that we have secured all-party support for this package."
"It is also a reflection of our shared concerns."
"When the Commissioner reflects on her term in office, she can take particular pride in the role she personally, and her team, played in securing support for the Kyoto Protocol."
"But with emissions of greenhouse gases continuing to increase in most developed countries, we hope that this scheme can make a very significant difference."
"I hope that it will enable the European Union to retain its credibility as the world's leading force in pressing for action to curb global warming."
"I hope also that it will send out a very clear signal about our determination, both to the United States and to Russia - particularly to Russia - whose ratification of the Protocol is so important."
"Mr President, Commissioner, emission allowances are not naturally occurring phenomena and they have not been the result of human labour."
"They represent an administratively allocated abstract right to pollute the atmosphere."
"Emissions trading is not a market mechanism."
"It serves to reallocate emissions among the polluters, but not reduce them."
"The most despicable way of allocating emissions is by auctioning them."
"Things could easily turn out the way they did when the radio spectra were auctioned off: the air space was bought and sold and all the operators ran into trouble."
"We must not let that happen to European industry."
"As the system covers just carbon dioxide emissions it will be free to release other pollutants into the atmosphere."
"There are many questions the directive does not answer."
"I will mention some of them."
"The emission allowances are to be sold on the stock market."
"Should an emission allowance, as a financial instrument, be regarded as being the equivalent of a share or an option?"
"How will its sale or non-sale be taxed?"
"How will emissions be recorded in company balance sheets?"
"How will they be treated with regard to private individuals' income and wealth taxation?"
"Indeed, will private individuals also be able to buy them?"
"We need to ask whether the EU will generally have the power to decide all these matters in a way that treats everyone in the same harmonised way."
"Emissions trading will be done on the stock market and stock exchange activity always involves speculation."
"There is a danger that the price of an emission allowance will be determined by speculators having no links with industry or any other source of emissions production."
"Then industry in the Member States might fall victim to the mechanism proposed by the United States of America, in which US industry is not involved and profits and losses depend crucially on the first administrative allocation of emission allowances."
"The Directive on emissions trading is a raw fruit, which should have been allowed to ripen longer."
"There are many Members in our group who do not believe in the trading of emission allowances on the stock market."
"Many Members, however, will vote in favour of the compromise amendments, because they are better than Parliament's report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all my congratulations to Mr Moreira da Silva."
"This is a very important directive, perhaps the most important one of these five years, and tomorrow it will be brought to a successful conclusion."
"The opt out that Germany was so keen to see for entire sectors is explicitly no longer possible."
"A heavy defeat for the Ministry for Economic Affairs and even for Chancellor Schröder."
"Still more important is that next year the Commission will study seriously how transport sectors, with stress on the plural, can be brought under this directive."
"And that is most sorely needed."
"Both road traffic and air traffic are going too far."
"All the internal air traffic within Europe will count for the achievement of the 8% reduction."
"Can the Commission confirm that it is working on a concrete proposal to bring air traffic within Europe under this directive?"
"It is very important that we conclude tomorrow because that, as Mr Davies has already said, will give the right signal to both the Duma in Russia and the government and the opposition in the United States that this is a serious system."
"This is the most efficient way of reducing CO2 and I do not therefore understand the GUE Group."
"May I start by warmly congratulating not only Mr Moreira da Silva, but also the Commissioner and her officials, who really have pulled out all the stops to produce a good proposal."
"This was an extremely controversial proposal."
"There has been much weighing up of the pros and cons in many a European boardroom, in many Member States and therefore within the political groups as well."
"How will this impact on our business?"
"What will the options be for new investments in production capacity?"
"What will an expansion cost if we have to purchase rights?"
"And finally, what will the consequences be for the competitiveness of industries that are already finding it difficult, such as the refining industry, the chemical industry and the iron and steel industry?"
"Mr President, what we seemed almost to have forgotten in the discussions was that we were all there when agreements were made in Kyoto and that this directive on emission trading was simply a good way of ensuring that the reduction tasks could be implemented in a very efficient manner."
"That was the underlying intention of this proposal."
"In other words, how to use an economic tool to serve the environment."
"Trading in what one business has too much of and another too little."
"The path to the compromise, which I otherwise support, was not an easy one."
"The economic interests for European industry as a whole were great and a European approach to the problem therefore went without saying."
"At the same time we had to put on record that a European approach was also very difficult because there were such great differences in starting positions, not only because the environment has been rather better implemented in one Member State than another, but also because the objectives of the Member States were so different."
"Yet something good came out of it."
"The political compromise takes the existing differences into account."
"Agreements have been made for benchmarking and I am very happy with them, likewise with the Commission's control of them."
"It has also been agreed that the auctioning, in any event for the first but also for the second period, is allowed but is not compulsory."
"Mr President, I appreciate what has been achieved, especially the benchmarking, and for that I thank my fellow Members, in particular Mr Blokland, and once again the rapporteur."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is taking us down a new road."
"Until now, we had used direct taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, and we could have done that here by specifying CO2 threshold values for certain types of plant."
"Rather than do that, we have opted for indirect taxation via pricing, and, as one finds with indirect taxation, here too, our problem is that it sets off many side-effects that we had not initially wanted."
"That being so, Commissioner, it is the Commission's particular responsibility to take matters in hand as regards any such side-effects."
"I will mention just three of them."
"The first is that emissions trading may of course have an effect on enterprises' balance sheets and end up being a factor in their shutting down production or moving it elsewhere."
"That has nothing more to do with the protection of the environment; it would be a purely commercial calculation."
"This is where, as a principle, climate protection must, without doubt, be given priority over factory closures and the transfer of production."
"The second question, Commissioner, is whether there are safeguards ensuring that emissions rights are indeed issued for the sake of climate protection and not as part of individual Member States' policies on industry."
"One of your core responsibilities is to check to see that they are issued in accordance with fair criteria and with the aim of reducing greenhouse gases that affect climate."
"Thirdly, might it not also be the case that advantages in terms of comparative costs will lead to the indirect promotion of atomic energy?"
"Here too, it is for the Commission to take responsibility for ensuring that no indirect impact is envisaged here."
"I hope that you will have plenty of staff and plenty of courage to enable you, in the interests of workers, to discharge that responsibility."
"Mr President, as our colleague, Mr Seppänen, said, our group is no supporter of the trade in emissions allowances, because we believe it may contribute to the imbalance between rich and poor countries, but we Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do support Mr Moreira da Silva's proposal, because it tries to establish stricter controls on this trade, restoring some of the amendments from first reading, which we believe to be important."
"Despite this lack of enthusiasm, I hope that the rapporteur is right when he says that this trade will correct the situation of non-compliance on the part of the majority of Member States - my own country is perhaps one of the worst offenders - and contribute to teaching European companies in preparation for 2008 when the international trade comes into effect, and, most importantly of all, may convince the United States to comply with the Kyoto Protocol."
"We agree with the rapporteur on the need to include the six greenhouse gases, although the common position only establishes that, as of 2008, the Member States will be able to request their unilateral inclusion in the allowance trading system."
"We believe it to be important that projects which relate to the mechanism for clean development and joint application should not be a replacement for prioritising emissions reductions, which must be achieved within the European Union."
"In any event, the common position includes certain proposals from the European Parliament which we believe to be very important, such as, for example, the demand for greater transparency in the registers, in relation to the ownership of transfer and the cancellation of allowances, the obligation to publish the names of non-compliant operators and penalties imposed for non-compliance, which are now fixed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the vital importance of this directive in environmental and economic terms is clear."
"The European market in emissions allowances will provide the Member States with an effective instrument within their climate change policies to close the gap between the true situation in the field of polluting emissions and compliance with the Kyoto commitments, while creating the best possible cost-benefit relationship."
"The political importance of this directive is perhaps less obvious, but no less significant."
"European environmental policy is moving on from words to actions, from rules and principles to practice, linking the economy to the environment."
"This always creates uncertainty, resistance to change, apparent winners and losers and there is no doubt that this can be argued over, but I believe there are many more arguments to convince us, and to convince us that we are moving in the right direction, and to confirm that Europe, by means of directives such as this, is consolidating its determination to lead the process of achieving sustainable development."
"In this case we must thank the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva, for the excellent work he has done."
"He has achieved agreements between positions which were initially very far apart and in the end we are going to avoid the need for conciliation by reaching an agreement with the Council which is satisfactory to both sides."
"Personally, as he knows, I have been very critical and I have been a great nuisance to him over some of the amendments approved at first and second readings, above all those which seemed to me to impose excessively rigid conditions on the Member States for the application of the directive and which made it difficult for each State to find and define the best way to fulfil its objectives."
"However, this agreement, which has been reached following long and difficult negotiations inside and outside Parliament and the Council, has lead to a much more open text, which is no less effective and is acceptable to everyone."
"We needed a directive which was sufficiently flexible to allow the Member States to be able to adapt their requirements and operation to the characteristics of their national policies."
"I believe it was a complicated task which has been successful."
"Mr Moreira, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to congratulate you and take pleasure in having been able to successfully take such an important step towards practice in the environmental field."
"Mr President, I would sincerely like to acknowledge all those who have been involved in creating this compromise, which we will vote on tomorrow."
"It has been said several times here that after the first reading it was difficult to believe that we would get this far, that we would have a directive on emissions trading available to us whose content is sensible and rational in a way that makes it possible to be accepted from very different points of view."
"We obviously have to remember that this is just one of the many ways we have to aim for a reduction in greenhouse gases."
"If this way were not available to us, we would have to find another, but it has been seen and shown that this is a cost-effective scheme and in this sense it is good that it is to be introduced."
"I wish to stress, however, that these last minute discussions and negotiations resulted in the unreasonable proposals that seemed to be included, such as a ceiling on national emission allowances, being taken out."
"Moreover, the fact that auctioning is to be voluntary is excellent."
"This way companies that have opted in will not be under strain."
"In conclusion, my congratulations go to the rapporteur and all the others involved."
"We still have a long road ahead of us in our endeavours to reach the Kyoto targets, but the compromises this report and this directive have achieved mean that we are a step further along the way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my warm thanks to Mr Jorge Moreira as rapporteur."
"He has fought with much energy, determination and expertise for a good and practical system of greenhouse gas emissions trading."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for its strong support for such a system, but I have to be perfectly honest and say that I am disappointed with the Council."
"I think we would have achieved more and could have got a better system if the Council and my own government in particular had been more constructive."
"Unfortunately, some Member States, Germany among them, tried for a long time to torpedo the whole system and weaken it."
"The upshot is that the compromise we now have is not as good as it might have been if everyone had sought a constructive solution from the outset."
"I think some problems are inevitable unless great care is now taken with national implementation and monitoring by the Commission."
"The aim of the system is to cut the costs of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and - much more important - to create an incentive for undertakings to develop new ways of saving energy and greenhouse gases."
"Market economics is a powerful system; it is capable of opening up potential, if only we set the right conditions."
"Market economics should also therefore be brought to bear on environmental protection, which is what this system seeks to do."
"As I said, the Commission and the Member States now carry a heavy responsibility for implementation because the compromise is not as precise as Jorge Moreira and Parliament as a whole would have liked, but was watered down somewhat by the Council."
"Now, some risk of over-allocation still remains and the Commission will have to watch things very carefully; there is also still a risk of allocations being made that have no regard for the technical possibilities."
"We all know that coal can very easily be replaced by gas or other energy sources, but it is not so easy to cut CO2 emissions for lime, cement and steel."
"That must be taken into account when allowances are allocated, otherwise it will not be fair."
"Mr President, it was quite remarkable how the Commission and Parliament were able to reach a tidy compromise under the providential leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva."
"I think it is also an expression of European identity, because climate policy has a good name in Europe."
"May it continue to do so."
"When it comes to emissions trading, we must be careful not to confuse two things."
"Trading in emissions does not save one tonne of CO2; that is only saved by investment."
"But emissions trading encourages investment, that is to say it triggers a search for the cheapest way of cutting CO2."
"It is also sensible from an economic point of view and industry and many government leaders, many of whom still find emissions trading strange, need to see that."
"Secondly, Mr Seppänen - and, to some extent, Mr Lange as well - have rightly pointed out that a few questions are still unanswered."
"For example, are emissions rights securities?"
"How are they treated?"
"These are questions for which an answer will probably have to be found in the future, at either national or European level."
"As regards cost factors for undertakings, Mr Lange is quite right to say that undertakings' balance sheets will probably look different in future than they do today, especially if CO2 costs more than it does today."
"Today it costs EUR 5 to EUR 6 a tonne."
"Once it costs EUR 20 to 30 a tonne, the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy."
"Let us hope that these will be the ones we are looking for, namely cuts in CO2."
"Mr President, the unanimous sign-off of this emissions trading directive in December 2002 at the Council of Ministers was a major wake-up call to corporate Europe and a signal that this was actually going to happen."
"Quite frankly, I do not think they believed it up to that point."
"I extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Moreira Da Silva, for the enormous body of work that he did in bringing all of us to where we are today."
"Ireland has one of the worst records, second only to Spain, for greenhouse gas emissions."
"National emissions allowance capping will ensure that quantifiable Kyoto objectives are met and that we decouple economic growth from increased greenhouse gas emissions."
"National allocations will have to be linearly convergent with the Kyoto Protocol."
"The national cap on allowances can start from the 2003 emissions level and not from that of 1990, provided that the allowances are decreased to the Kyoto figure by 2012."
"Amendment No 43 is very important as it allows Member States to benchmark the best available technology for allowance allocation."
"This should ensure that one-off, economically-vital industries can be looked after in a Member State."
"The force majeure provision is also necessary until a liquid trading market emerges."
"It is critical to secure the viability of the emissions trading market in the short term if it is to survive in the longer term."
"In particular, a situation where, as a result of market design, allowance prices significantly exceeded the long-run marginal cost of abatement within the EU and approached the penalty price would be unsustainable."
"It is appropriate that provisions be made to deal with unforeseen circumstances during the pilot period of 2005 to 2007."
"In the absence of market management mechanisms and taking into account the risks involved, the current force majeure clause could provide flexibility for Member States to cope with unforeseen events such as market failure, and avoid serious economic shocks."
"Definition by the Commission of the circumstances under which it may be applied is appropriate and desirable for Member States in advance of them preparing their national allocation plans."
"In conclusion, the provision for banking 2005 to 2007 surplus allowances into the 2008 to 2012 period effectively reduces the number of allowances available for allocation in that period and will act as a constraint on Member States in applying force majeure."
"Nonetheless, given the large uncertainties and the major risks involved, the provision for force majeure must be retained."
"Mr President, it is hard to imagine any other report that would have so great an impact on the state of things in Europe and about which the decision-makers know so little."
"Europe is now moving into unfamiliar territory."
"Even theoretical research on the effects of emissions trading exists in name only."
"When two or three years ago we had the Commission proposal before us, it started to become clear how enormous the gaps were in the proposal upon which we had been building a European strategy for the economy, competition and the environment."
"There was no appraisal made of the impact of enlargement, no guidance given about how emission allowances could be accounted for in companies' books, no information regarding value added tax, not even a strategy in case of serious market problems or speculative attacks, no precise data on emissions in Member States, let alone emissions in companies, and no proposal regarding rights of appeal."
"It is regrettable that we had such an incomplete proposal on such a major issue."
"Much has been done to put things right, but whether or not we succeeded remains to be seen."
"The 'trendline cap' problem in Trilog was solved with a formulation proposed by the Commission that allows Member States to approach the Kyoto targets along their own paths."
"In being allowed room to move, Member States are also being encouraged to embrace a transport policy that is more responsible in terms of the Kyoto Agreement."
"That of course is our real problem."
"Trilog's solution for project-based mechanisms should also be supported."
"There is no sense in setting more stringent criteria than was agreed at Marrakech."
"We need, rather, to establish EU rules concerning how converting the emission allowance credits earned from project-based mechanisms into marketable emission allowances can take place without the climate change imperative being compromised."
"The emission allowance credits earned from the project-based mechanisms will also have an interesting impact on development cooperation."
"I believe Member States will become much more interested in development cooperation, because they will see the chance to earn emission allowance credits with projects."
"Combined heat and power production and process emissions posed a special problem in connection with emissions trading."
"If the causal chain associated with the nature of CHP is not taken into account, there will not be any reductions in emissions either."
"Now Trilog is discovering and acknowledging the special nature of CHP."
"Member States can take the potential for a reduction in process emissions into account, which in practice means that the best European steel factories can earn their full emission allowance quotas and they will not have to bear additional costs in a world steel market that has been fiercely competitive."
"That means the risk of carbon leaks will diminish and there really will be an increased chance of preventing climate change."
". Mr President, firstly, I am totally convinced that the issue of climate change will follow not only us but generations to come, and it will become more and more difficult and we will have to be more and more ambitious in order to meet this enormous challenge to human life on this planet."
"This issue will not go away and we will have to deal with it and find solutions."
"I am also convinced that we will need all the different tools we can find: legislation, as well as voluntary agreements and market-based instruments, like this one."
"That is also why it is important that we take the initiative and try this out."
"We have studied carefully the experience already gained with sulphur trading in the US and we have conducted studies."
"We have also prepared in a prudent way the start of an emissions trading system in Europe."
"I shall just comment on two things that were mentioned."
"Firstly, the treatment of allowances."
"Allowances will be a tradable commodity, just like many other tradable commodities, and it is not different just because it stems from an environmental policy."
"It will be subject to existing taxation legislation in the Union - not different from any other area."
"On transport, we wanted to start with large, fixed-point installations, whose emissions can be feasibly monitored."
"The transport sector consists of many small diffuse sources that we thought would be difficult to monitor, administer and control."
"This has been important in designing this proposal, but we accept that transport also has to be subject of action when it comes to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions."
"We are happy to look at how this area can also be covered."
"This is now part of this compromise package."
"Under the text of the directive, the Commission is committed to researching how the transport sector could be brought into the scheme."
"We will also come back on other issues, as you know, which are in the pipeline to link them to joint implementation and the other flexible mechanisms as well."
"We will also come back on these issues."
"Mr President, I have asked the Commission in Dutch and in English whether it will include aeroplanes in this."
"It can be easily measured using data from only a few take-offs."
"Commissioner, can you answer 'yes' or 'no' as to whether you intend to do this?"
"Could you please answer this question?"
". Mr President, in answer to that question, of course we will see what we can do on air transport also, but we do not have any ready-made plans."
"As you know we are trying to work in international fora to address this problem."
"It is already a part of the discussion under the Kyoto Protocol and we will now have to follow up and see what we can do in order to address the whole transport sector."
"Of course we will also have to look at what it is possible to do regarding air transport."
"We do not have any ready-made proposals or a set date which we can present to you."
"However, we will do our best to also address air transport."
"Thank you very much for that additional information."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
". (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the lateness of the hour there is a problem we would like to broach."
"This is what we tend to think of in Dutch as 'bloated chickens'."
"It is currently legal to fill chickens with water."
"It is possible to add 30%, 40%, 55% water to these chickens."
"The problem is that to keep them looking a little like chickens proteins are then added to these chickens, proteins from offal, from chicken meat that is supplemented with pig proteins and with cow proteins."
"This happens in particular in Dutch companies and this chicken meat, if you can still call it chicken meat, is then sold in the UK as Halal to the Muslims and Kosher to the Jews."
"This is unacceptable and this was emphasised in a BBC documentary."
"I know that the Commission will propose labelling: 'chicken with pork' or 'chicken with beef'."
"We therefore propose simply banning it: no water may be added to this chicken."
"The UK Food Standards Agency has proposed the addition of no more than 15% water."
"What is your response to this?"
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Lucas, Mr Lannoye and Mr de Roo for tabling a question on adding water and protein to chicken meat."
"In May 2002 the Irish and British authorities published the first worrying results of their investigations concerning chicken breasts imported from the Netherlands and intended for the catering industry."
"The results published by the same authorities on 12 May 2003, show that the problem remains."
"The practice of artificially increasing the weight of meat by the addition of protein and water - in some cases up to 40% or 50% water in the final product - in order to mislead the purchaser is despicable."
"It appears that purchasers and, by association, consumers are being misled on three counts."
"First, the labelling of the product may lead to the assumption that it is fresh poultry meat, when it is clearly not."
"Second, some products have been labelled as Halal despite containing pig as well as other animal proteins."
"Third, the meat contents expressed have been overstated."
"Enforcement and possible sanctions arising from the infringements of legislation relating to the labelling of foodstuffs and unfair practices are the responsibility of Member States."
"According to the information transmitted by the Irish and British authorities, the chicken products concerned are in the main manufactured in the Netherlands."
"That does not mean that there is no other country concerned with this issue."
"I have asked Member States to strengthen their controls and reinforce their cooperation."
"Fraud appears when you are looking for fraud."
"As regards the letter from the Dutch authorities of July 2002, I have, along with my colleague Commissioner Fischler requested more information from the Dutch authorities about the measures taken and the origin of the protein."
"In March of this year the Dutch authorities undertook to ensure that these products were correctly labelled."
"However, inspection results from the UK and Irish authorities indicate that the problem of fraudulent labelling continues to exist."
"I have therefore asked the Member States to improve collaboration between national authorities and to strengthen the controls."
"Furthermore, I have decided that there is a need to improve the labelling requirements for chicken and other meat preparations."
"The Commission will propose to Member States in the food chain committee to include an explicit mention, for instance, of chicken preparation with added water, on the food label."
"The standing committee on the food chain and animal health composed of representatives of Member States welcomed this suggestion at its meeting on 8 April 2003."
"The technical discussion will continue during the next committee meetings."
"I have also asked my services to consider the development of standards for meat preparations that would limit the amount of water that can be added to such products and the use of animal proteins for the purpose of bulking."
"Your suggestion to indicate chicken meat containing beef or chicken meat containing pig is one that will be examined along with the possibility of banning the use of such proteins in poultry meat preparations."
"As regards the detection of the addition of pork or beef protein following enzymatic treatment to destroy the DNA, this will be examined by the Commission Services with the experts from the Member States."
"In addition, it is important to emphasise that other control methods, including documentary checks, should be used to check the origin and traceability of products."
"Mr President, I associate myself with everything Mr de Roo has said, and his outrage at these events is shared by many in the United Kingdom, which is the principal destination for these adulterated products."
"I would like to press the Commissioner further."
"Since chicken at the moment can be legally sold when it is 55% water and is adulterated by other proteins which the perpetrators of this scam boast is PCR negative and, therefore, cannot be detected by most tests, is it not the case that there should be a more direct form of action from the Commission?"
"The FSA in Britain has now proposed, through Sir John Krebs, its chairman, that we should set a limit of 15% for the water content of what is labelled and sold as chicken."
"He has further said that at that level the addition of these proteins - which intended to sustain the holding capacity of a much larger proportion of water - would therefore become unnecessary."
"It is still the case, however, that many of those who are at the moment exporting these tainted products will continue to attempt to evade legal provisions and checks."
"I would like to hear from the Commission that it will intervene not merely by recommending better labelling and better testing - though, of course, we need that - but by taking action to outlaw these activities, which are a total fraud on the public and are likely in one respect to cause serious concern, because the injection of beef protein - which the perpetrators admit has come from countries where there is BSE, and they have not tested the products for that - may cause serious public concern as well."
"This is a matter that has outraged the United Kingdom and many others."
"We need improved testing, but we need direct intervention here from the Commission, and I am confident that we will get it."
". In response to the questions that have been put to me by Mr Whitehead and Mrs Wallis, let me repeat what I said earlier: I have asked my services to consider the development of standards for meat preparations that would limit the amount of water that could be added to such products and indeed the use of animal proteins for the purpose of bulking."
"My intention is to analyse the work that has been undertaken by my services, to determine what further work can be done."
"I agree, to some extent, that labelling may not be sufficient."
"I, like you, have also watched that television programme."
"I found that some of the labelling that was identified in the programme indicated that the particular product was 65% chicken."
"It raises a question for the consumer: what is the other 35%?"
"We have spent a great deal of time in this Chamber debating - as we did this afternoon - questions relating to GMOs and the labelling of GMOs."
"But it requires some degree of vigilance from consumers: they must read these labels and draw appropriate conclusions."
"Having said that, this does not relieve us from examining the appropriate responses to situations such as this and seeking a more satisfactory response."
"As I said earlier, in my original answer, I am looking at this."
"However, I also appeal for some consumer vigilance as a response to the work that we do here in relation to labelling."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The next item is the report (A5-0240/2003) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2004 budget in view of the conciliation procedure before the Council's first reading [2003/2027(BUD)]."
"Before giving the floor to our rapporteur and to those Members who have been placed on the agenda, I remind you that it is 11.40 p.m."
"We have a very large number of speakers and this is not the last debate on the agenda."
"I therefore ask you all to respect your speaking times."
". (NL) Mr President, I should like to repeat what I said on a previous occasion."
"One of the main objectives of the 2004 budget will be the smoothest possible integration of the new Member States."
"We shall therefore be spending the whole year working on a budget for probably 25 Member States and on this basis we shall be taking a political decision in December."
"In this report we speak of the position that Parliament must take in the conciliation procedure and a number of main subjects traditionally have a part to play in first reading conciliation."
"First of all we have agriculture."
"The margin of 1.4 billion currently calculated is positive, but all the items in the agriculture budget are based on a dollar-euro rate of 1.07."
"This is probably on the low side and so we are also looking to the letter of amendment at the end of October, which will also contain the conclusions of the agricultural negotiations in Luxembourg."
"What are the financial consequences of this rate?"
"Apart from this point, Parliament has set a number of priorities for the agriculture budget in the form of pilot projects or preparatory actions."
"In the first place we think that, given the number of outbreaks of infectious animal diseases in the last ten years, there is a great burden on the agriculture budget."
"In future the agriculture budget will not have the margins that it has had in the past."
"We therefore think that very serious thought must be given to some form or other of insurance system against infectious animal diseases and some or other European animal disease fund will have to be created."
"We want to make a start on this."
"Secondly, future payments to farmers will be based not only on historical actions, but also on the environment, method, on cross-compliance: one good turn deserves another."
"All well and good, but these environmental indicators are not all that precise."
"Mrs Wallström has unfortunately disappeared, but there is much to say about the nitrate directive. Something has to be done about that."
"Other points that we consider important are the development of better vaccines against infectious animal diseases and a quality policy for agricultural products."
"As for fisheries, the most important point is that the Council, which regrettably is very sparingly present this evening, must as soon as possible take a position with regard to the financing of the reforms that were agreed in December of last year, in particular with regard to the scrapping fund that is mentioned therein."
"We think that in principle credits must be made available for this."
"Otherwise better control of the quota and more research into fish stocks are the main points for us."
"Common foreign and security policy. The Council promised to give Parliament information about this policy as of 15 June."
"This information had not arrived by the time of the printing of this resolution."
"I understand that it was handed over here just an hour ago."
"We shall be examining it closely."
"We think that we should be informed about everything, not only about the actions, but also about the budget of the European Parliament, as well as about the budgets of the Member States themselves."
"Both are communicating vessels and cannot be seen separately from one another."
"As regards the structural funds, we think that the N+2 rule must be applied."
"We also think it interesting to hear precisely what the estimates have been that are given to the Commission by the Member States each year so that the Commission can draft a good budget."
"It is always interesting to make this comparison."
"We should like to have this information from the Commission."
"Another important point for this budget: we want to promote economic development in the new Member States."
"We think that this can for example be done through the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and through investments in these new Member States."
"We are therefore expecting good cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London and with the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg."
"We shall be raising this as well."
"I do have a number of other points, Mr President, but since you, given the lateness of the hour, were so insistent that I keep to my time, this I shall do."
"Perhaps the position of the Parliament will emerge later in the resolution itself."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission adopted the preliminary draft budget for 2004 - a historic budget that will, for the first time, cover an EU of 25 Member States - on 30 April and I presented the preliminary draft here in plenary session on 13 May."
"Tomorrow we will begin the trilogue, that is to say, the actual negotiations."
"This trilogue traditionally concentrates on expenditure for the agricultural, fisheries and common foreign and security policies, the compulsory expenditure."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his comments."
"I will not discuss all the points in the report right now - for reasons of time and because talks are continuing today and tomorrow."
"I would like to begin by noting an important point of agreement; this is that we want to reach agreement on the budget for 25 Member States by December 2003."
"Although the budget resolution can for the time being only be adopted formally for the budget for the EU of the 15, there should be complete agreement on the amending and supplementary budget for the 10 new states in December."
"Adjustment of the multi-annual programmes is also important in the light of enlargement."
"The Commission has made a proposal for the adjustment of the amounts, and this is now the subject of intensive discussions in the various parliamentary committees."
"It is, however, important that we settle the procedural questions now so that agreement can then be reached on the amounts and the legislative changes can be made as quickly as possible."
"With regard to the pending legislative procedures, I would like to return briefly to the legal basis for granting support to various institutions - the A-30 lines."
"This is also extremely urgent and I am hoping that the Council will deal with it quickly."
"Now a brief word on the various areas of expenditure that will be the subject of the trilogue and which Mr Mulder raised."
"In October, the Commission will as usual be presenting the adjusted expenditure estimates for agriculture, which will of course take into account the outcome of the Luxembourg agricultural compromise, which contains higher expenditure for 2004 than that suggested by the Commission."
"So far as the proposal for insurance for farmers against various risks is concerned, the Commission has commissioned a study of the matter and I am informed that the findings will probably be available this summer."
"The Commission will then make the conclusions known and I hope I will be able to tell you more at Parliament's first reading."
"If I may turn to expenditure for fisheries, cuts have been made here only in the area of research, and this was the outcome of the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Research Programme, in which Parliament was involved."
"EUR 55 million are now available for fisheries research."
"Regarding the fisheries agreements themselves, the Commission has informed Parliament about renegotiations and the estimated costs and here, too, we shall be looking at how far the amounts provided will need to be modified in a letter of amendment in October."
"The Commission has proposed an increase of 8.4% in the budget line for the common foreign and security policy, in order, among other things, to again fund the expenditure for the special envoys from this budget line."
"A brief word about pilot projects and preparatory actions; you say in your report, Mr Mulder, that the margin of EUR 80 million is not very great."
"I am actually proud to have been able to rescue the EUR 80 million margin, given the various things my colleagues wanted in this category."
"If we make good use of this area for pilot projects and preparatory actions and cooperate as closely as we did last year, I think it will be possible to agree on good projects here."
"I would also like to say something about the Structural Funds, which you mentioned, and the Member States' predictions of how much money they will require next year."
"We are faced here with the usual situation that the Member States estimate a very much higher amount than we have provided for in the proposal."
"The Member States say they will need EUR 6.2 billion more."
"But I would like to point out that last year, 2002, the Member States' estimates were 70% higher than the amount that was actually taken up."
"Let me finally speak about the question of the number of posts at the Commission."
"I think it is clear that the Commission can cope with the work involved with ten new Member States only if it has more staff."
"It is in all our interests, and especially of course in the interests of the new Member States, that the work is done and that it is done well."
"Since all the institutions are making successful enlargement a matter of the highest priority, I am confident that a good solution will be found here, too."
". (NL) As rapporteur for the budget in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am well aware that the budget consultation procedure between Council, Commission and Parliament traditionally focuses on three specific areas, that is agriculture, fisheries and the common foreign and security policy."
"As regards the latter I can fully support the three positions that are underlined in the Mulder report."
"Since the budget for external policy is approximately EUR 5 billion and that for the common foreign and security policy EUR 40 million, our committee wanted to focus attention on a number of other points than common foreign and security policy."
"First of all the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy seeks further clarification from the European Commission on the financial framework for the southeastern Europe region for the period 2004-2006."
"Although the European Commission has recently promised an additional EUR 200 million, it is still very unclear precisely where this money is to come from."
"Secondly, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is also seeking special attention for the EU police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Although the mission is being conducted more than adequately, we are receiving various signals that necessary materiel is sometimes being supplied too late or not at all."
"Finally, our committee is seeking special attention for the additional financial needs of the wider Europe initiative."
"Provision must be made for adequate resources for the CARDS, MEDA and TACIS programmes and possibly also for a new neighbourliness tool."
"It gives me great pleasure that the Committee on Budgets has taken up this and other recommendations and I should like to compliment Mr Mulder on his clear and powerful report and wish him every success in the tripartite talks."
". (NL) Mr President, I should like to echo the compliments for Mr Mulder's report and input."
"In much of it we recognise ourselves as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but at the same time we note that the credits for agriculture and rural development are falling sharply in the 2004 budget."
"For agriculture alone the share is falling from 40% to 36%, while there is a slight increase for rural development."
"In its policy plans the European Commission says that agriculture must produce with a greater market focus, but at the same time any incentive to do so in the budget is being taken away."
"It is not really acceptable that the amount for the promotion of agricultural products for example has been reduced in the preliminary draft budget for 2004."
"In addition - as Mr Mulder himself has said - the dollar rate is a great risk: a rate of EUR 1.07 is being assumed and that is substantially lower than the current rate."
"The question is what that could mean for the budget in the long term."
"There has also, despite a number of outbreaks of major animal diseases, been almost no extra money set aside for possible future outbreaks."
"At the same time we have started on a different policy for outbreaks of animal diseases, for example the new policy for foot and mouth disease."
"This means that in the event of future outbreaks the Commission might spend far less money on slaughter."
"As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we should like to see this money being set aside to cushion the market consequences for farmers who at the time are vaccinating without the animals being slaughtered, but who experience the consequences of this, that is lower market prices."
"This is also the first budget for the Union of 25 Member States and in fact it is very strange that, converted to the structural funds, there is still less money available per head of population for the new Member States than for a number of existing Member States."
"To summarise, Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development thinks that the money that is to be spent on rural development, in particular in the new Member States, must be expressly intended for strengthening the small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas."
"There must be extra money for the promotion of agricultural products that meet all the food safety, animal welfare and environmental requirements and money must be set aside, perhaps through fund formation, for cushioning the effects of a different vaccination policy for animal diseases."
". (DE) Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 32 million are needed."
"Who can help?"
"Mr Mulder is willing, who else?"
"The Commission or the Council perhaps?"
"Every year we go through the rigmarole of the budget procedure again and unfortunately not everyone's wishes can be met."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, I naturally also regret that our wishes do not necessarily have top priority."
"The 2004 budget procedure is, however, unusual in two respects."
"Firstly, it is the first one to be drawn up using activity-based budgeting; this is an improvement that I very much welcome, since it gives us a clear overview without having to spend a lot of time leafing through the budget lines, especially in the area of fisheries."
"Secondly, we are faced with the unusual situation that from 1 January 2004 until 30 April 2004 the budget will apply to the present 15 Member States, but from 1 May 2004, the date of accession of ten new countries, it will apply to 25 Member States."
"We are enlarging and have still not done our homework."
"The situation is alarming."
"In the light of the catastrophic state of fish stocks, last December the Council agreed, after much dragging of feet, to the reform of the common fisheries policy, not least because of clear promptings from Parliament."
"One of the most important features of this was the creation of a 'scrapping fund', which was to start before the end of this year."
"So far, however, the Council has not given the green light for the use of the flexibility instrument."
"That is hard to understand."
"I therefore call urgently for this point to be raised in the conciliation procedure beginning on 16 July, so that we can at least learn what position the Council takes on financing reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I am by no means releasing the Member States from their responsibility."
"But we cannot allow the Council to use the Member States' unwillingness to provide the relevant information as an excuse for blocking one of the main purposes of the reform."
"Please give us your support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are attending this debate on budgets at this late hour more than anything else in order to accompany the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, so that he may feel accompanied and supported by the political groups in this House, with a view to the conciliation which is going to take place on 16 July."
"I would like to say that our group, the PPE-DE, fully supports the strategy laid out by the general rapporteur with a view to the conciliation with the other two institutions."
"We believe that this first conciliation is of great importance, given that it is the first real exchange of requests and strategies between the three institutions, and I therefore believe we have proposed a conciliation strategy which will be particularly useful and beneficial to the interests of the European Parliament and of the European citizens in general, which is the reason why we are here."
"From this strategy which we are taking to the conciliation, the report by Mr Mulder, I simply wanted to highlight certain points which are the subjects of our group's amendments."
"In particular, with regard to fisheries, we have heard the explanations given us by the rapporteur on budgets of the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs Langenhagen, and we fully agree with them."
"We believe that the Council must fulfil the commitments which were established for the financing of this scrapping fund, not only in 2003, but also in 2004, and that is why we are proposing amendments to the Färm report and also the Mulder report, although we know that they will possibly not be accepted by some of the groups in this House."
"We attach so much importance to this that the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will form an integral part of the delegation from our group which will go to the budget conciliation, because we want to stress how important the issue of fisheries commitments is to the Committee on Fisheries, to Parliament in general and to our political group."
"Finally, another issue which we wish to highlight is the application of the N+2 rule, which has been discussed earlier."
"Our argument - and this is expressed in our amendment - is that there is a need for an assessment."
"We believe we are at the beginning of the process of applying the N+2 rule and, therefore, rather than making value judgments about what approximation the Commission should carry out in the application of this rule, what really interests us is to be given an assessment of how it is being applied, what the initial results are and, on that basis, to produce a common strategy in this Parliament on the application of the N+2 rule on the part of the Commission in the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his outstanding success in bringing together the interests of the committee and also in taking up the matters which are necessary for the conciliation procedure ahead and resisting the temptation to rewrite all the guidelines we wrote earlier this year."
"This is a report that is very cogent, very concentrated and which we very much support and welcome."
"The procedure which we shall now be entering in the next three weeks with the Council and the Commission will continue to exist for a short time."
"We hope, however, that it will soon be a thing of the past."
"If the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure were no longer made - and there is much in the Convention to suggest it will not be - then something Parliament has been advocating for many years would actually become reality and we would no longer need this advance mediation."
"That would be a good development and I hope we shall see it."
"Now to the individual points."
"So far as agriculture is concerned, a number of matters are raised here."
"I want to concentrate on a number of questions."
"First, the move to increase support for rural areas provided that there is a stronger focus on those areas in the new Member States than we had in the EU of the 15; we expressly welcome this."
"In view of the current debates - in Poland in particular, where ministers have resigned because they are evidently missing the opportunity to actually create the structures there that will allow the money to be used properly - I believe that all states must understand that no money can flow if the relevant structures are not in place."
"That must be made abundantly clear, and we shall be watching to see that the money is used according to the rules."
"All we can do is urge that the foundations be laid for it here."
"So far as insurance against eventualities such as disasters in agriculture is concerned, we are willing to look very closely at the survey and the expert report."
"Some Member States already have voluntary insurance for such contingencies."
"They would of course be penalised if the European taxpayer were to be called upon to cover these things elsewhere."
"We will examine this without prejudice and we are willing to act, but we will of course not go blundering blindly into anything either, because we have to know what the long-term consequences might be."
"So far as fisheries are concerned, I heard very clearly what Mrs Langenhagen had to say and we have always been prepared to support fisheries and the scrapping of ships where necessary."
"We are not, however, going to write any blank cheques, and we are not going to give a few million euros away in advance for a programme that has not been finally evaluated and on which the Council has not taken a position."
"We will do the same as we have done with other programmes in the past, such as scrapping in Portugal and Spain."
"In those cases, we wanted to have the full programme first and we said we would evaluate it and would then say how much would be made available for it."
"We will proceed no differently in this connection than we did with the Portuguese and the Spanish, even though we are now looking at other regions of Europe."
"We are in favour of increases on the common foreign and security policy."
"I would point out once again, however, that cooperation in peacekeeping is more than just peace enforcement as provided for in the Petersberg tasks of common foreign and security policy; it is also conflict prevention, and we do not support the envisaged reduction in appropriations."
"In this matter, we want to continue as before."
"Prevention is better than having to use military means to clear up afterwards."
"Finally, let me say something about the question of payment."
"The N+2 rule was introduced by us all and there was a point to it."
"Wanting to check whether it is right at this stage, before it has really come into play for the first time, is quite out of order."
"This N+2 rule must be applied, and those who fail to spend their money accordingly must know that there are consequences."
"Showing them a way out at this early stage would amount to killing the N+2 rule and we will not go along with that."
"Mr President, the report before us on the conciliation procedure with regard to the 2004 budget presents a good picture of Parliament's main areas of focus."
"I want to thank Mr Jan Mulder, as a member of my own group and as general rapporteur, for an excellent report."
"Next year's budget is legally problematic, as for the first four months the EU will be a community of 15 Member States, but will expand to comprise 25 Member States from the beginning of May."
"Because each Member State has to be able to participate in decision-making affecting itself, the budget for the enlarged Union cannot be finalised until after enlargement."
"The budget's principles of universality and annuality, however, require that it should be drawn up immediately for the whole year."
"For that reason the solution sought, where the budget will be dealt with, as appropriate, in December, with the part that concerns the new Member States not being finalised until there is an Amending Budget next May, is the proper way to proceed."
"The budget has also now been clearly presented as an activity-based one."
"This will clearly separate operational expenditure, administrative costs and responsibility for implementation for each policy area."
"This is an excellent reform."
"It will increase the budget's information value and facilitate its monitoring."
"This system, however, should be improved, for example by including all administrative expenditure in the budget for each policy area, as the report points out."
"The biggest weakness in the preliminary draft budget is the meagre amounts for payment appropriations."
"They represent just 0.99% of the Gross National Income of the Member States, which is the lowest they have been for 17 years."
"At the same time outstanding commitments have skyrocketed and at present are reaching the EUR 126 billion mark."
"This is an increase of EUR 15.4 billion on last year."
"If we want to achieve a balance in EU budget policy, commitments and payments have to be balanced."
"This will mean improvements in administration and simplified systems at all levels."
"I wish my friend, Mr Mulder, every success with the rest of the work."
"Mr President, on the eve of enlargement and half-way through the financial year, cooperation before the Council's first reading takes on special importance."
"I concur in general terms with a large proportion of the rapporteur's quantitative analysis of the amounts suggested by the Commission in its preliminary draft."
"Even so, I want to take this opportunity to mention a deep and widespread concern at the fact that the preliminary draft budget for 2004 is the smallest, in relative terms, since 1987."
"It represents less than 1% of the Community's gross domestic income, and I want to point out that such a low level of expenditure is utterly incompatible with the political ambitions so often claimed for the European Union. It is also incompatible with the ambitions which should be priorities in the current climate of rising unemployment and socio-economic recession."
"There is a logic of constraint, stemming in particular from the Stability Pact, with which we are not in agreement, just as we are not in agreement with the systematic budget reductions made perfectly obvious by the rapporteur's insistence on the restricted application of the 'N+2' rule."
"The cancelling of authorisations and the policy of redistributing and anticipating expenses underpin this restrictive logic. These practices have not only become common: they also detract from the integrity and transparency of the budgetary process."
"That is why I can only restate the need for new financial approaches as one way of resolving this situation, which is totally unsustainable."
"Mr President, Europe finds itself in economically heavy weather."
"All the Member States are having to tighten their belts, the European Union likewise therefore."
"Apart from the fact that the 2004 budget is dominated by the accession of an expected ten new Member States, we shall be using the activity-based budgeting tool for the first time."
"I want to ensure that the expenditure on administrative management is kept to the minimum possible."
"As has already been said, the Commission has based the expenditure on agriculture on too low a euro-dollar rate."
"Can the Commission give an indication of the expenditure at the current exchange rate?"
"I support Amendment No 2 to increase the resources for the fishing vessels scrapping fund."
"The Commission must then however exclude any form of capacity expansion or subsidisation from the structural funds, otherwise it is just banging your head against a brick wall."
"The drop in the structural funds for the current Member States I applaud."
"Strict application of the N+2 rule is necessary, otherwise the reservoir of commitments will endure artificially."
"Given enlargement this cannot occur."
"Amendment No 4 does not therefore warrant any support."
". (DE) Mr President, I would just like to come back to the remark made by the previous speaker, Mr Walter."
"He compares the EUR 32 million called for with a sum of money we once paid to Portugal and Spain and with which we now want to assist a few other states."
"That is not the case."
"This money is for the entire European Union."
"That can be checked in the Minutes and, at the Commission's suggestion, it will be made available only if the Council is willing, because it has agreed to the fisheries policy reform."
"I just wanted to make that correction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0233/2003) by Mr Färm, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2003 budget: implementation profile, transfers of appropriations and supplementary and amending budgets [2003/2026(BUD)]."
"Mr President, a successful budgetary policy for the EU requires not only decisions on figures and budget items, for the EU has serious problems when it comes to implementing the budget."
"An important part of Parliament's budget policy must therefore be about follow-up and evaluation and keeping track of the implementation of the budget."
"It is therefore very important that we give due weight to the annual report, which we are debating today, on the implementation of the budget."
"There are a number of matters of particular concern to us this year, for example, outstanding commitments."
"After four months of 2003, total outstanding commitments - known as RAL - had increased to EUR 126 billion, compared with EUR 110 billion at the same time last year."
"Even though we do not have all the facts concerning the causes of this and concerning what are in actual fact abnormal outstanding commitments, the trend is clearly worrying."
"We are also concerned about the 2002 surplus of EUR 7.4 billion, even though it is an advance, given that, last year, it was more than double this at EUR 15 billion."
"We nonetheless still have underutilisation to the tune of EUR 9 billion, which is an unacceptable figure."
"In the case of the 2003 implementation, the beginning of the year even shows a lower level than during the same period of 2002; in particular, category 3 and 4 commitments entered into in April were lower than at the same time last year."
"There are a whole lot of different problems."
"The recent visit of our delegation to Bosnia, like a host of other contacts, also makes us worry that a lack of information about the new budgetary arrangements may have caused problems, for example for the external delegations."
"It can have negative effects upon the benefits, in terms of efficiency, of the reform process and of decentralisation."
"We also saw a number of problems within the common foreign and security policy in connection, for example, with the EU's police mission in Bosnia where tenders, contracts etc were concerned."
"On this subject, we believe that the Commission should investigate whether separate rules might not be needed to adapt our measures within the common foreign and security policy."
"Within the separate expenditure categories, we are still critical of the way in which export subsidies for the transport of live animals are dealt with."
"We regret that the Council did not accept our proposal concerning the account plan, which would have made the system significantly more open to inspection."
"We must therefore make a new attempt this year."
"Because I do not just want to be critical, we can also observe that, for example, rural policy in actual fact exceeds our expectations when it comes to implementation."
"What most concern us, however, are the structural measures."
"The proportion of implemented payments in this area has declined during the first months of the year in spite of the tough criticism in previous years."
"We are also anxious about the increase in outstanding commitments, which rose to almost EUR 94 billion as per 30 April 2003 - an incredible sum!"
"Where this is concerned, something new needs to happen."
"Quite a few fellow MEPs have mentioned the N+2 rule, which we must arrange to be applied effectively."
"When it comes to the structural funds, we are delighted about the simplification process begun by the Commission."
"We nonetheless believe that it needs to become significantly more vigorous within the current arrangements but, above all, the preparations for a more thorough review prior to the new arrangements must be set in motion quickly."
"In category 3, we are a little concerned about research and development."
"We are, on the other hand, pleased that there is a positive trend, prior to enlargement, when it comes to the programmes for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as for the pilot project concerning small and medium-sized businesses."
"We also welcome the fact that pilot projects and preparatory measures are now part of the implementation plan for 2003, on which we agreed last autumn."
"Where external measures were concerned, there was clearly less implementation in April of this year than for the same period of 2002, and this is something that concerns us."
"On the other hand, we are pleased about the prompt agreement to activate EUR 79 million from the disaster aid reserve for Iraq, as well as about the new proposals concerning southern Africa and Ethiopia."
"We only hope that the situation in Iraq and the Middle East does not give rise to such a degree of uncertainty in connection with the 2003 budget that it could entail problems for the other areas within external policy."
"That is not something we intend to accept."
"Finally, one of the basic problems we have when it comes to implementing the budget is that, overall, we have a rigid budgetary system that really needs to be modernised and altered."
"This is, however, basically a task for the Convention, which will shortly have concluded its work, and for the future constitution."
"Where this is concerned, I hope that we shall see a radical reform in the future."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are holding so timely a debate on budget implementation so early in the year."
"Parliament receives the figures on budget implementation on a weekly basis."
"These are direct figures from the accounts."
"No Parliament of the Member States is kept informed like this."
"I stress this because the Commission's accounting has been and is a subject of public debate and a lot of things are said that are not always entirely correct."
"I am glad that we can debate the matter properly here and I thank the rapporteur for his detailed report."
"Apart from these weekly figures, you also receive a report three times a year commenting on the implementation of the budget and giving details in particular of so-called abnormal RALs, that is commitments the Commission entered into a very long time ago and commitments for which no payments have been made in the last three years."
"The level of commitments entered into and which will result in corresponding expenditure in the next few years amounts now - at the end of June - to a total of EUR 122 000 million."
"I agree with Mr Färm, the rapporteur, that this amount needs to be reduced quickly."
"But I also agree that we must be careful not to label the total amount of RALs as abnormal because this year that is not correct."
"The Commission has a budget for commitment appropriations showing their amount, something that is not the case in many Member States, for example."
"I would like to comment on a few points or questions from your report, Mr Färm."
"First the question of the directorates general or policy areas to which the total 717 posts approved by the Budgetary Authority in 2001 and 2002 were allocated."
"You will be getting a detailed listing of these."
"In the last few years we have strengthened the foreign policy area, among others, and also such implementing areas as, for example, regional policy or the growing area of justice and internal affairs."
"Another point: what is the staffing plan for the Enlargement DG in 2004, after the accession of the ten new Member States?"
"The 2004 Budget assumes there will be an appreciable reduction in staffing, in the number of posts in this directorate general, a reduction of 105 posts in fact."
"You must bear in mind that the Enlargement Directorate-General's activity next year will not be confined to the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, but that it will continue to administer pre-accession aid; also, a specific programme was agreed for 2004 and subsequent years in the accession negotiations to continue to give administrative assistance for the development of a good administration."
"The further trend for the Enlargement DG will then be reviewed in the course of the 2005 budget procedure."
"Regarding the state of budget execution this year, you also note that implementation is less than at the same time last year."
"This has in fact to do with the work involved in bringing in the new Financial Regulation."
"This new Financial Regulation brings far-reaching changes for financial management."
"It is a fundamental reform."
"The Directorate General for the Budget trained over 1 000 members of staff last year."
"But there is much that is new and requires familiarisation."
"Recipients of payments have to be asked for better security arrangements, for example."
"That also requires a degree of familiarisation on our side."
"I would like to make a few special comments about budget implementation in the external fields."
"Generally speaking, the rate of utilisation in the first few months of this year does not necessarily set the trend for the rest of the year."
"So far, commitments totalling EUR 1 800 million have been made, which is not at all bad."
"With regard to pre-accession aid, I would also like to point out that in this case implementation continues to be unsatisfactory."
"If, however, you compare this year's budget implementation figures with those from last year, you can see that there has been some acceleration."
"We had a special situation with humanitarian aid."
"You mentioned it yourself."
"Here, funding was cut in the course of the 2003 budget procedure, even remembering that there is the emergency reserve."
"The Budgetary Authority has approved EUR 79 million for humanitarian work in Iraq."
"We have asked for a further EUR 25 million for southern Africa and tomorrow we will be talking about a further EUR 15 million for Ethiopia."
"I hope we will find agreement on that, too, because it is essential that aid be provided really quickly here."
"I think everyone involved agrees with that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, early or late we can now discuss the implementation of the 2003 Budget."
"I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Färm, most sincerely for carefully reading the figures that he has kindly made available to us."
"What he read was of course not so pleasing, and I would like to sum up in only very general terms by saying that, as a member of one part of the Budgetary Authority, I have to ask myself what force and what decisiveness we must bring to bear in order, together with the Council, to prepare a budget - which is, after all, policy in figures - when those who have to implement it are far from being in a position to implement that policy in the way the Budgetary Authority wanted."
"That is in fact a fundamental criticism that I have already voiced in this place on a number of occasions, and things get no better, they get worse."
"That cannot of course be the Commission's long-term strategy."
"The budgets we present are always tight ones, and then we want to make ourselves more popular with the Member States by not spending the money we have just argued over so passionately."
"I now have a large number of complaints on the table where individual groups that are supposed to be supported out of the Community budget, as is stipulated in the rules on the matter, are faced with massive administrative problems in negotiations with the Commission, especially this year because of the new Financial Regulation."
"All the rules must be followed, but my plea here would be that we also help to ensure that in the end resources actually can flow."
"Bureaucracy - or the proper control of the use of resources - is not there to make payments basically impossible."
"Mr President, this year's general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Göran Färm, has produced an excellent report on the implementation of the budget and I wish to thank him sincerely for that."
"The report quite rightly examines two key points in detail, those being outstanding commitments and decommitment, that is, the N+2 rule."
"As I mentioned earlier on, outstanding commitments stood at EUR 126 billion in April, which was an increase of over EUR 15 billion in one year."
"These outstanding commitments were especially evident in the Structural Funds where they stood at EUR 94 billion, which is to say the amount for appropriations for almost three years."
"The situation is grave."
"At the start of the present programming period the N+2 rule was approved."
"It states that there is to be decommitment if no payments have been made for two years."
"The Commission seems to be interpreting the rule in such a way that advance payments, which are not even based on any invoices presented, should be regarded as payments."
"A project can be kept alive in this way from one year to the next by means of small advance payments, even though the project itself might not have even begun to be implemented."
"The Commission should improve the way the N+2 rule is monitored and restore its original purpose."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the motion for a resolution (B5-0320/2003) by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on trafficking in children and child soldiers."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has already issued two resolutions on the question of child soldiers, one in 1999 and one in 2000."
"Why use the procedure for urgent cases, then, to include on the agenda a recommendation for a new resolution, one which goes further, of course, since it extends not only to child soldiers, but to all forms of trafficking in children?"
"The reason is that the problem is still growing and the European Union is not showing enough determination."
"Three hundred thousand children, boys and girls, are enlisted in combat units in more than 30 countries."
"Every year, 1.2 million children are victims of a traffic which has now become a rapidly-expanding 'industry', worth almost EUR 3 billion per year."
"After drugs and small arms trafficking, it is the third most lucrative criminal activity in the world."
"The fight against this scourge - beyond comprehension in the twenty-first century - should be a cornerstone of European Union development policy."
"It is a sad fact that this is not the case."
"On the world stage, however, more and more action is being taken, as demonstrated by the coming into force, in 2002, of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography."
"We request that the Council encourage Member States to ratify this protocol with immediate effect, for too few of them have done so up to now."
"We also request that children's rights become a political priority for the Union, to be reflected in budgetary decisions involving the allocation of sufficient resources to a specific heading, with a view to improving their effectiveness and raising their profile."
"This priority is also to be reflected in a common strategy."
"The Council, of course, adopted such a common strategy in principle on 10 December 2002, but the final document should appear and come into force without delay."
"Our motion for a resolution suggests several courses of action in this connection. These include the appointment of a high-level representative for children's rights; a common policy focusing on preventive measures; support and protection of victims; closer cooperation with the countries of origin; and international arrest warrants against the organisers and perpetrators of this unspeakable traffic."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her speech."
"I am surprised that no-one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, that tabled three amendments to this report, has spoken in this debate."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the draft report on children's rights that has been prepared for the meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"It highlights the enormous challenge facing the international community over the protection of children's rights."
"First, on the subject of child soldiers."
"The European Union supports the UN special representative and welcomes the initiatives of the UN Security Council, in particular Resolution 1460 of 30 January 2003."
"The European Union calls on all states to ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to hasten ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which describes the conscription and recruitment of children under the age of 15 or their deployment in hostilities as a war crime."
"At the political level, the European Union is endeavouring to find a common line on the problem of child soldiers."
"In December 2002, the Council authorised the development of a strategy or guidelines on this subject."
"UNICEF and other agencies then organised a meeting of experts on children's rights on 14 March 2003."
"The recommendations made at that meeting stress among other things the importance of a pre- and post-conflict strategy and the necessity of making this subject a cross-sectional topic in the European Union's entire decision-making process."
"The Council working party on human rights will, in due course, be examining what steps should be taken next."
"Regarding European financing for measures to help children in armed conflicts, the following must be said."
"Children are a focus for humanitarian aid in ECHO."
"This commitment is reflected in specific projects, advocacy measures and research activities."
"Children are one of the three focal points of the ECHO strategy for the current year."
"Secondly, on combating trafficking in children."
"The European Union has introduced a large number of legislative, political and financial initiatives."
"In 2002, the Council adopted the framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings and reached political agreement on the draft for a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"On the Commission's initiative, the 'European Conference on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings - a Global Challenge for the Twenty-first Century' was held from 18 to 20 September last year."
"The Brussels declaration was a concrete outcome of that conference."
"Then on 25 March 2003 the Commission decided to set up a group of experts on trafficking in human beings, which will assist the Commission in putting forward further concrete proposals at European level."
"The group will in particular present the Commission with a report based on the recommendation of the Brussels declaration."
"In 2002, more than EUR 1.7 million were used as part of the STOP II programme to finance 16 projects to combat trafficking in human beings and to combat sexual exploitation."
"The TACIS and CARDS programmes also support projects to combat trafficking in human beings in east and southeast Europe, and an action plan against trafficking in human beings has also been developed as part of the EU-Africa dialogue."
"Thirdly, on the subject of 'children and development', the Commission is pursuing the Millennium Development Goals as its objectives, in particular the achievement of universal primary education and the reduction of infant and child mortality."
"Although children as such are not a specific target group of our development policy, they benefit from a large amount of aid in the areas of education, health, AIDS and population policy."
"Finally, the Cotonou Agreement, for example, contains specific provisions for the protection of young people, in particular combating child labour."
"The Commission has also intensified its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation as a whole for the purpose of promoting these objectives."
"Finally, I would like to note that the report contains many interesting proposals for increasing the European Union's commitment to children's rights."
"It is true that the Community currently has no specific competences in this area."
"We await, however, with interest the outcome of the talks on the draft constitutional treaty, the European Convention, which for the first time provides for the protection of children's rights as a specific objective of the European Union."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that detailed response."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.38 a.m.)"
"The programme of the Italian Presidency"
"The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the programme of the Italian Presidency."
", President-in-Office of the Council. (IT) Mr President, as one of the founding countries, Italy has a long experience of remaining true to the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which, within the space of a few decades, have enabled us to develop peacefully one of the most remarkable political and institutional experiments in the history of mankind."
"Italy is therefore keenly aware of the moral and intellectual responsibility and honour of presiding over the Union in this constituent period, when we need to hold on firmly to the lessons of the past in order to build the future, to deal with new developments and seize opportunities that were previously unimaginable, and to overcome differences by finding new solutions, which in turn will enrich our shared project."
"With the full accession of new Member States and the attendant redefining of our identity, it is time to recognise the value of the art of negotiation."
"Europe as we know it, as built by its governing classes, is the product of enormous determination and brilliant intuition, which have given a spirit and language to shared values and feelings; these have brought together and revitalised the separate strands of national history, traditions and culture."
"The Europe of today is great: it owes its greatness to its achievements, to its potential, to its proud contribution to peace and international law, but it owes its particular greatness to the specific technical expertise which it has brought to bear, overcoming every crisis, clash of interests and difference in vision by applying a common method, common rules and a common approach to adjusting both method and rules to the realities of a changing world."
"We all know that there is sometimes a price to be paid for negotiation and that it may be high."
"If it is not driven by the enthusiasm of shared goals, negotiation can look very much like bureaucratic paralysis, a long and extenuating process of avoiding problems and procrastination."
"The Italian Parliament, which has never feared the truth, has been acutely aware of the bouts of fatigue and the tendency to sell Europe short which have at times characterised our common European endeavour, and it has condemned those tendencies with frank, pro-European zeal."
"With the self-confidence born of long experience and the humility needed to tackle crucial political issues, Italy will therefore do everything in its power and everything it feels is necessary to provide Parliament, the Commission and the governments of the European Council with the environment most conducive to taking informed, calm and responsible political decisions on our future."
"The purpose of negotiation is, indeed, to enable decisions to be taken on substance, and the measure of our success in settling our differences will be whether it enables us to make a great leap forwards and to give our gradually integrating economies, our cultures, our foreign policy and our defence policy a new and efficient institutional shape."
"A great Europe needs great institutions."
"If the world calls for Europe to act authoritatively in tackling today's major challenges - the fight against terrorism, the reduction of inequalities and imbalances, world economic recovery - it is our duty to respond with a Union which can act decisively and therefore exert influence, a Union which can take resolute, clear decisions on the basis of a clear grasp of the common interest and commonly held convictions which are above any form of particularism."
"This Union, which we have decided to build together, whose shape has also been discussed during the splendid work of the Convention chaired by Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and benefiting from the vigorous contribution of the Greek Presidency and representatives of the Commission, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments, can only be founded on the framework of values and historical experience that, for over half a century, has bound us to that other great exponent of modern liberal democracy, the United States, co-founder with us of the Atlantic Alliance."
"If this web of different partnerships - at a different level of political integration - is again to live up to its ambitions and its civilising achievements, for the sake of peace and world security, relations between States must cease to be conducted in monologues and, instead, we must seek to reinstate open, genuine, honest dialogue."
"Europe can be cured of its Hamlet syndrome and decide to become a wholehearted, active player on the world stage; it can acquire the diplomatic, economic and military means to perform that role convincingly, without jeopardising its autonomy, its roots or the great freedom-giving structures defended over the years within the framework of its Western alliances."
"As we found at the recent Summit in Thessaloniki, there is deep, shared understanding of this, set out in the very valuable document coordinated by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, which seeks, in a new strategic vision, to overcome the differences that have emerged over recent months with regard to the tragic crisis in Iraq and developments in the crucial issue of the Middle East."
"Italy knows that it is not alone in venturing once more to wager on successful negotiation in order to move the situation forward."
"In the European Parliament, under its President, Pat Cox, and in the political groups with which we had an enjoyable, valuable meeting in Rome, we feel we have an attentive, patient partner but one which would not fail to hold us to account for our mistakes."
"In the Commission and its President, Romano Prodi, we see the essential link ensuring continuity in the administration and day-to-day coordination of our institutional system."
"The European Council, in both the reinvigoration of the plan for growth, based on large-scale investment in civil infrastructure, and the great constitutional opportunity presented by the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, will be the forum in which this six-month Union Presidency, which falls to Italy, will seek to define a bold but not reckless agreement on the major issues of institutional balance, the extension of qualified majority voting, the limits of the common foreign and security policy and the European area of justice."
"We cannot overlook the fact that Member States' views on some of these questions still differ."
"The Italian Presidency will do its utmost to bring about convergence of these positions although it is fully aware that the debate on the Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty cannot be completely reopened."
"The Intergovernmental Conference will therefore have to focus its efforts on the genuine points of contention still outstanding."
"This ground plan has also dictated the Presidency's goal of adhering to the timetable suggested by the Thessaloniki European Council."
"Thus, we will open the Intergovernmental Conference in October and keep the proceedings to a tight schedule with a view to reaching agreement by December."
"(Applause from the right)"
"The European Parliament will be involved in the work of the Conference in the most appropriate manner."
"I call upon the European Council to involve the President of the European Parliament in the work of the Prime Ministers and Heads of Government on a permanent basis."
"(Applause from the right)"
"I call upon the General Affairs Council to involve the representatives of the European Parliament in their work on a permanent basis."
"The proceedings will be conducted at a senior political level in order to avoid the impetus provided by the Convention getting bogged down in detailed diplomatic negotiations, as has happened in earlier Intergovernmental Conferences."
"With this in mind, I undertake to return here to address you after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the day after the December European Council, so that we can review together what has been achieved."
"The goal is to enable the future Constitutional Treaty to be signed sometime between 1 May 2004 (the date on which the ten new Member States will officially join the Union) and the elections in June 2004 for the next Parliamentary term."
"Any extension of the negotiations beyond those dates would mean dissipating the precious store of constitutional wisdom developed by the Convention; it would also involve asking European voters to elect their Parliament without knowing the institutional shape of the future Union."
"I can, moreover, only rejoice that, for appreciable reasons of historical and symbolic continuity with the original Treaties of 1957, it has been agreed that the final signing of the Constitutional Treaty is to take place in Rome."
"We are honoured by this prospect and will do everything possible to ensure that the Member States' representatives are welcomed in a manner worthy of the occasion and, of course, of our traditions of hospitality."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, constitutional reform is certainly a top priority for the future of European integration, but the Union must also be able to meet its citizens' legitimate day-to-day expectations."
"Europe must increasingly live up to its role of creating economic growth and prosperity."
"Here, we are on solid ground: the euro is an element of stability for the economies of the Member States which have chosen to support monetary union, and the Lisbon Strategy mapped out a process of convergence to increase European competitiveness."
"However, we cannot overlook the persistent flaws of our economic structures, evidence of which lies in the lower-than-forecast growth rates."
"On the basis of the annual operating programme presented jointly with the Greek Presidency at the beginning of 2003, the Italian Presidency has set out a number of specific initiatives."
"The modernisation of agriculture, environmental protection, consumer protection and food safety are essential requirements for our citizens; in these areas Italy will steer work towards the goals identified by earlier Presidencies."
"I will therefore confine myself here and now to three points which we feel are crucial for Europe's competitiveness."
"The first point is the need to provide more effective support for the economy by increasing public and private investment with the cooperation of the European financial institutions, especially the EIB."
"We consider that such a strategy should be based especially on boosting the policy of major Trans-European infrastructure networks."
"If the internal market is to work efficiently in the enlarged Union, it will require greater mobility of goods and services and a more efficient transport network."
"The need here is to square the legitimate requirements of monetary stability and financial rigour - which must not be called into question in any way - with the need to stimulate economic growth more powerfully through investment in research and technological innovation as well as infrastructure, for we firmly believe that the European economy's most important resource is its human capital."
"(Applause from the right)"
"The second priority is discussion of the sustainability of the European pension and welfare systems."
"Intergenerational solidarity and the adaptation of existing schemes to the reality of a progressively ageing society are challenges that we can no longer shy away from."
"Bearing in mind that situations differ from Member State to Member State, we must investigate policies to increase the level of employment among older workers and to reduce the trend towards early retirement."
"Our third and last point is the need to modernise the labour markets and promote entrepreneurship, particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned."
"In this field, too, the opportunities offered by the great internal market which is being extended to include the ten new Members will elude the EU Member States unless they adopt a coordinated approach."
"These strategies can be implemented through dialogue between the social partners."
"Indeed, the European model is based on a market economy which seeks to strike a balance between free enterprise and the claims of cohesion and solidarity."
"In this connection, there can be no neglecting that more vulnerable, silent section of Europe's population, whom legislative inertia all too often prevents from taking a leading role but whose civil and moral contribution remains invaluable."
"I am referring to the 38 million European citizens with disabilities."
"The European Union has proclaimed 2003 the 'European Year of People with Disabilities'."
"In addition to the awareness-raising and information events and campaigns already organised, the Italian Presidency will endeavour to lay the foundations for legislative action to combat discrimination, for an instrument to protect people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life and give them a future of hope."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union also contributes to international stability, and its responsibility in this respect starts at its immediate borders and depends on its capacity to be open to increasingly advanced forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries."
"In this case too, the Italian Presidency intends to carry on the work of previous presidencies."
"During the current period between the signing and the entry into force of the Accession Treaties, we shall seek to ensure that the 10 new Member States participate fully in the work of the Council, making it easier for them to be fully integrated into the Union's institutional mechanisms."
"At the same time, we shall attempt to establish by December a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania which paves the way for the accession of both countries by 2007."
"We shall continue the pre-accession strategy vis-à-vis Turkey on the basis of the conditions established at the Copenhagen European Council last December."
"We know that the decision on the date for opening negotiations will not be taken until the end of next year, but, with this in mind, we consider it all the more advisable that the Union should actively support the reform process already initiated by the current Turkish Government."
"We shall continue to emphasise the European prospects of the countries of the Western Balkans, in line with the Zagreb Process."
"The agenda we agreed upon at Thessaloniki represents a further step forward."
"In retrospect, analysing the European Union's role in the Balkans, we can be proud of ourselves."
"If we compare the current situation to the situation 10 years ago, we can see that intervention by Europe and the United States made it possible to bring to an end the bloody conflicts of the former Yugoslavia, the last major European civil war, and we hope that this will also prove to be the last time that European blood is shed on European soil."
"We believe it is now time to move on from the present phase of association and stabilisation agreements to a more integrated strategy, with a view to strengthening our relationship with the countries of the region."
"We are aware of the complexity of this approach, but we also know that Europe is offering the only prospects able to provide the governments of those countries with an effective incentive to proceeding without delay along the path of reform, modernisation, the free market and the rule of law."
"The Italian Presidency sees the invitation from the Commission, supported by the Member States, to encourage increasingly close relations with the areas closest to us to bring about what we have labelled 'Wider Europe', in a very positive light."
"We shall therefore seek to strengthen our relations with Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova."
"We shall likewise seek to consolidate relations with the Russian Federation particularly strongly through increasingly close dialogue and specific measures that are tangible confirmation of Russia's desire to belong to the political, economic, social and cultural fabric of Europe and the West."
"We consider that the focus on Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism should now be mirrored by equal interest in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue; this dialogue is crucial for relations between the West and the Islamic world, an issue we feel to be as important today as Eastern Europe has been in the past."
"Our aim is to establish a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, already launched by the Barcelona Conference."
"The economic and social development of the southern area of the Mediterranean is essential to world stability, in view of the culture, politics and demographics of the southern Mediterranean."
"The integration of Europe's economy with that of the Arab countries is a major challenge of our time and is the key to peace and security in this area and in Europe as a whole."
"We shall therefore cultivate the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, to which we shall devote a large number of economic, cultural and social initiatives - including a Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations - and we shall cultivate the project to transform the financial facility currently operating within the EIB into an autonomous body, in other words a genuine Mediterranean Bank."
"On the basis of the decisions adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conferences in Valencia and Crete and approved by the Thessaloniki European Council, the Italian Presidency endorses the wish expressed by the European Parliament and the national Parliaments to see a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly established during this Presidency as a mark of a constant commitment to dialogue between Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean seaboard."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, establishing conditions for international security is now a key task for the countries which share a set of universal values based on freedom, democracy and peace."
"This is the main area in which fundamental transatlantic relations and the partnership between Europe and the United States must now be reinvigorated."
"We wish to confirm our conviction that there is no incompatibility between a strong European undertaking and equally strong transatlantic solidarity."
"Mindful of this, we will strive to restore depth and dynamism to the relationship between the Union and the United States, which are also vital if Europe is to have greater authority on the world stage."
"The establishment of a solid, balanced transatlantic relationship also depends on a substantial European undertaking in the field of defence, in line with the NATO framework."
"The fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and support for the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are specific areas in which to test our ability to build a solid relationship of cooperation between the two shores of the Atlantic."
"We are thinking in this particular instance of the need to establish a democratic civil fabric in the reconstruction of Iraq and support for the peace process in the Middle East."
"As regards the Middle East, we are quite aware that the situation is extremely complex."
"Our Presidency, together with the United States, the Russian Federation and the United Nations, will work in support of the roadmap towards the establishment of time limits and procedures for launching an international peace conference."
"My country has offered to hold the conference in Sicily."
"There are at least two lines of action that we intend to promote: firstly, restoring a relationship of greater trust with Israel with a view to broader and more structured mutual cooperation, and, secondly, implementing the plan - already launched by Italy at European Councils and G8 Summits - for rebuilding the Palestinian economy, which could act as a tangible, effective incentive in negotiations between the parties."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of brevity, I cannot list all the Union's responsibilities on the world stage, but I feel bound to mention the economic, cultural, civil and, I would venture, spiritual ties that link Europe with Latin America, a region currently experiencing a period of change which Europe hopes will generate freedom and justice."
"The Latin American States have asked us to open up our trade frontiers."
"The success of Latin America is that of the other America, linked to Europe in a different but no less significant fashion than North America."
"I also wish to say that we shall work to strengthen our existing ties with Africa, to which we are bound through its unhappy history, with Asia, with the regional organisations and with the United Nations system to move forward together on the great challenges of the fight against poverty and disease, environmental protection and conflict prevention."
"We will also focus on the balanced development of international trade as a source of greater well-being and reduction of inequalities - the subject of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Cancun next September."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe want democratic, transparent institutions, a prosperous economy and a free society, but also an area of freedom and security."
"At Tampere, Seville and, most recently, at Thessaloniki, the European Council recognised the need to enhance Europe's capacity to combat transnational organised crime, illegal immigration and related trafficking, through more effective controls at the Union's external borders."
"We will endeavour to work on these points, focusing on the mobilisation of adequate financial resources, the gradual implementation of a common readmission policy and the integrated management of external borders."
"Above all, however, we will emphasise the need to include illegal immigration issues in relations between the Union and the countries of origin and transit of migration flows."
"We must introduce effective forms of cooperation with some of our neighbours, especially in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, in the field of control and management of migration flows."
"Our legitimate request for more effective cooperation from these countries in endeavours to prevent illegal immigration will be matched by willingness on our part to integrate citizens of third countries legally resident on Union territory."
"As well as continuing legislative work on asylum and visas, we consider it a priority to improve the operation of all the Union's operating mechanisms for combating crime, starting with the strengthening of Europol."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear from my remarks just how sensitive and complex the challenges facing the European Union are, challenges to which our Presidency will endeavour to help find a solution in the limited time available, in a spirit of humility and service and in the full, firm knowledge that the security and prosperity of our future will depend increasingly on the process of European integration which has guaranteed us peace, freedom, security and well-being for half a century now."
"The Europe of today is no longer the airy kite capable of playing the winds of history that it was at the time of the Treaty of Rome."
"Our Union has become much stouter and is weighed down with responsibilities and duties towards its partners and the rest of the world."
"My hope is that, during the Italian Presidency and looking onwards to the Irish Presidency, we shall succeed, with the cooperation of all those involved and with the particular help of the new Member States, in restoring to our institutional giant something of its lightness and its original energy."
"(Applause from the right)"
"President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian Presidency is beginning at a critical point in the life of the Union."
"It has the tough but exhilarating task of carrying through the revision of the Union's founding Treaties and delivering the first European Constitution."
"Indeed, the six months of the Italian Presidency will see the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, which will work on the basis - the 'good basis' to quote the Thessaloniki Conclusions - of the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention."
"The Convention is Europe's first experience of a constitution-building process."
"We should therefore not underestimate the impact of the word 'Constitution' on our European life, which has made it possible to achieve results that appeared quite unattainable a while ago."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights will be enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty. The Union will have a single legal personality: this considerably strengthens its international status."
"Defining the powers of the Union will allow the citizens to distinguish more clearly between the competences of the Union and those of the Member States."
"I have never pretended, however, that I was happy that certain reforms I consider indispensable - and which many have called for - have been tackled too timidly or not at all."
"In September when the Intergovernmental Conference opens, the Commission will accordingly be putting the key issues still unresolved on the negotiating table with its opinion."
"Qualified-majority voting has been extended to many areas but not enough to meet the needs of an enlarged Union: there are other areas where unanimity should no longer be required."
"The Union can hardly function effectively if decision-making calls for unanimity among 25 Member States: it would be impossible."
"The proposed arrangements for the make-up of the Commission do not reconcile the need for representativeness and the need for efficiency."
"A permanent presidency of the European Council is likely to bring overlapping and conflicts with the Commission."
"The euro, one of the Union's greatest political achievements - maybe the greatest - is still not represented effectively and coherently on the international stage."
"Clauses also need to be inserted on amending the Constitution by an enhanced majority."
"I cannot see how the Constitution can be adapted to the Union's new requirements without a procedure for amendments based on majority voting."
"No reform is possible on the basis of unanimity."
"Lastly, a more democratic and efficient institutional framework, which should come out of the Intergovernmental Conference, is vital, not least for an economic and social policy and a foreign policy with more clout."
"The Commission has the political will, the arguments and, if I may say so, the enthusiasm to press these points home forcefully."
"President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the other major challenge of the next six months is to press ahead with the building of 'Greater Europe' and to implement the new neighbourhood strategy."
"As we push on with enlargement, we also need to fully implement the pre-accession strategy for the candidate countries."
"The Commission is working actively on this."
"The aim is for this process to work well to the benefit of our fellow citizens and the Member States, both current and acceding."
"With the momentum provided by the Thessaloniki Council we can also continue to forge an ever-closer partnership with the Balkans, without which this phase of the enlargement process can never be considered to be complete."
"At Thessaloniki, we agreed on an agenda to take the Balkan countries to full membership of the Union."
"I am sure that the Italian Presidency will do its utmost to keep this region at the top of the Union's priorities."
"I am pleased that the strategy I proposed, the development of a ring of friendly countries, is starting to produce the anticipated results, and I welcome the unanimous support of the Heads of State and Government for this long-term European Union policy."
"In this context, it is vital that we move on to the practical phase of the new neighbourhood strategy without delay, with specific action plans and new systems of assistance."
"We are preparing a number of proposals along these lines for Parliament and the Council to consider and develop."
"In particular, as regards the Mediterranean region, I hope the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Foundation for Intercultural Dialogue will be in place by the end of the year."
"As you said, President-in-office, the European Union made an invaluable contribution to the drafting of the roadmap, alongside the United States, Russia and the United Nations, and it must also play a key role in its implementation."
"We will continue to pay close attention to transatlantic relations."
"The recent EU-US Summit in Washington marked an important milestone in our relations with the United States."
"Quite apart from the matters discussed - and the discussions proved to be amongst our meatiest in recent years - the most important aspect was the firm determination displayed on both sides to reestablish a climate of cooperation and solidarity."
"I am not saying there are no differences in our viewpoints and approaches to particular issues, but even where this is so, the strength of our relationship cannot be called into question."
"As I said at the Summit, our goals are the same, even if we seek at times to achieve them in quite different ways."
"Perhaps the clearest example of this fact is the relationship between the United States and the European Union in the field of international trade."
"Both sides want fewer barriers and better access to markets, fairer trade and clearer rules that are also appropriately tuned to encouraging the poorest countries."
"On some of these topics our practical approaches are different, but this does not stop us having a close, ongoing relationship that allows us to work round our differences, nor does it stop us working together to achieve a positive outcome in the multilateral talks within the World Trade Organisation."
"I want to make this quite clear, for all this is possible because the Union speaks and negotiates with a single voice in trade matters."
"It makes it a powerful, influential partner, which it is most certainly not in areas where competence is divided and fragmentary."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the toughest challenge we face is to restore the conditions for vigorous, balanced, enduring economic growth in the Union."
"The situation is difficult: economic growth has slowed down significantly, although I do not believe there is any reason to speak of deflation."
"At the same time, we must tackle the reform of Europe's social security system too."
"Competition from our trading partners and the ageing of our population make such reforms extremely urgent."
"However, before us there is also a great, unique opportunity: an integrated Single Market of almost half a billion people."
"I do not think we have realised what a powerful tool we have for the future."
"It is therefore crucial that we give practical thought to instruments for strengthening coordination of the Union's economic and fiscal policies, so that we can tackle the difficulties together and exploit together the enormous advantages the Union offers."
"The Commission is aware of how serious these challenges are and, in recent months, it has proposed two initiatives, which the European Council strongly supported."
"Firstly, we proposed - and our proposal was taken up - to utilise all the flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact so each country can adapt its fiscal policy to its own economic situation, without losing sight of the stability objectives and without overshooting the 3% limit laid down in the Pact."
"As I have said on a number of occasions, this was necessary but not sufficient."
"We need to move towards a period of closer coordination, and tax policies in the Member States - particularly those with the highest public debts - need to become more sustainable in the long term."
"Secondly, at the Brussels European Council last March, I raised the issue on behalf of the Commission of the need to give fresh impetus to completing the infrastructure necessary for European development and for supporting research, increasing spending to reach our target of 3% of the Union's GDP, as, moreover, is provided for in the goals we ourselves set at Lisbon."
"At the same European Council, I voiced my concern that investment in research in the Member States has actually, without a doubt, declined compared with last year, while Europe's major firms are transferring a growing proportion of their research outside Europe."
"Hundreds of thousands of our brightest talents are leaving Europe to work - and stay all their lives, unlike the Asians, who return home - in the United States."
"That is why the Commission has decided to react."
"In conjunction with the European Investment Bank, it is finalising an initiative to help to increase overall investment and private-sector participation in two key areas - trans-European networks and research and development projects - with a view to achieving the Lisbon targets."
"We want to mobilise and coordinate all the Union's current sources of funding and explore possible alternatives, without jeopardising Member States' budget stability."
"The Commission is pleased to note that the Italian Government has recently expressed its firm support for this strategy."
"Lastly, we need to speed up the approval of proposals prepared by the Greek Presidency but not yet approved."
"Approval of these measures in the course of the Italian Presidency will help to improve the Union's economic and social outlook."
"In particular, the proposed legislation concerns the following fields: temporary-employment agency work, take-over bids, measures in the wake of the 'Prestige' disaster, security of gas and electricity supplies, the second rail services liberalisation package, environmental liability rules, implementation of the 10-year action plan for people with disabilities, due to be presented by the Commission during the Italian Presidency, public procurement rules, the creation of the Single European Sky, the extremely important, impatiently-awaited directive on traceability of GMOs, the finalisation of the Directive on the European Patent, harmonisation of asylum procedures, the status of refugees, and, lastly, the Agreement with the ESA on the development of the European Space policy."
"I am confident that, with the help of the Italian Presidency and with your own help, President-in-Office, we will be able to adopt speedily the practical decisions needed to achieve these goals."
"Economic recovery is not just about reform: it also calls for confidence that proposals can be put into effect quickly."
"President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main challenges we must meet in the coming months."
"We are about to lay the foundations of a completely new Europe, and these foundations are political and economic, not just constitutional."
"The Commission is working to preserve and consolidate a strong and prosperous Europe that is also just and inclusive."
"The greatness of the European project lies precisely in its capacity to foster and extend peace, democracy, justice, prosperity and solidarity."
"Lastly, the Commission has fulfilled its responsibility to launch a wide-ranging internal debate on the post-2006 Financial Perspective."
"In the autumn, we will be presenting our political project for the enlarged and reformed European Union for discussion at the December European Council under the Italian Presidency."
"The forthcoming Financial Perspective represents a crucial stage in the European project."
"By 2007, the Union will have a new constitutional framework, in all likelihood 27 Members and a population of almost 500 million."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crucial time in the Union's history."
"A time that calls for unity and a strong commitment to cooperation among all the Community institutions and between the institutions and the governments of the Member States."
"I am confident that we will find the right solutions to the great issues facing Europe today."
"This calls for vision and conviction."
"For vision, because we really are laying the foundations for the Europe of decades to come, and we cannot accept short-term solutions that merely respond to the - albeit difficult - current economic climate."
"For conviction, because Europe is not just one of several options, one of a number of different alternatives."
"Europe is the only way forward: without Europe, our countries and societies will be irreversibly relegated to a marginal role."
"Italy has been there since the start of the European integration project and has always played an extremely important role."
"Think of the Treaty of Rome, think of the preparation of the Single European Act, think, on a more general note, of the enthusiasm and conviction with which Italy has helped to achieve the major goals of European integration, starting right here in this House with great Parliamentarians such as Altiero Spinelli and Emilio Colombo."
"We are all confident that Italy will continue unhesitatingly along that path."
"For a man with limited speaking time you did well!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council began by talking about Italy's historic role in European construction."
"I am going to speak to him frankly on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: we want Italy and its Presidency to present a bella figura, which succeeds, rather than a brutta figura, which fails."
"What worries us is that, when we hear President Ciampi talk about Europe, we feel more reassured, but when we hear President Berlusconi talk about Europe we feel more concerned."
"Today you have taken the Ciampi line."
"The problem is when you tell us that the Commission must be abolished and that Russia and Israel must join the European Union tomorrow morning."
"We agree that the Convention has produced a historic result."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, I will remind you of the first sentence of the preamble of the Constitution produced by the Convention, which was written 2 500 years ago and is still relevant - it is our fundamental creed - and it is a quotation from Thucydides: 'Our Constitution ... is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the greatest number'."
"(Applause from the left)"
"This means that we are obliged to make laws for the general interest and not to resolve specific cases involving a minority."
"That is the cornerstone of European construction."
"(Applause from the left)"
"With regard to the Convention and the Constitution, I have taken good note of the fact that you have expressed a will to negotiate."
"I would like to say that we, who would improve the text of the Convention, believe that there must only be formulations of a technical nature, in other words, negotiation over outstanding problems, and that the Constitution must not be rewritten and, in particular, not be moved backwards."
"You have made a proposal on the participation of Parliament."
"I am grateful for this, but I would like to say one thing to you: this is what we have had since the Treaty of Amsterdam, and even since the Treaty of Maastricht, that the President can attend European Councils and the conclaves, that we have representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference - we call them observers, but we want representatives."
"Now there is something else, however."
"The Convention has taken place."
"The doors cannot be closed."
"What we are also asking - and I hope that Parliament will approve this in its resolution - is that the Presidency should be obliged to provide information regularly, here and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Giorgio Napolitano, and that we should be able to invite, as we do, representatives from national parliaments."
"Yesterday we spoke about this with President Casini and we agree, because what we cannot do is return to diplomacy behind closed doors."
"You have also talked about the European economy."
"I was surprised that you did not refer to the Lisbon strategy, because what you have talked about is largely the implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"But in relation to the so-called 'Tremonti' proposal, which is a resurrection of the Delors plan and the van Miert proposal, it is good to hear from conservative politicians and conservative governments that a degree of Keynesianism is acceptable, because we have been asking for this plan for ten years."
"Well, let us see how we can do so, how you will apply the 'golden rule'?"
"(Applause from the left)"
"?how guarantees will be established ... even you, who are a successful businessman, could begin by making a first subscription to the bridge of Messina which would overcome the division between Scylla and Charybdis, which has been fundamental to European history over the last 3 000 years."
"With regard to the issue of intergenerational solidarity and the future of the welfare state, it is true that we must talk about pensions."
"I do not believe that you are proposing that Social Security and pensions should become a European competence - that would go further than what we are saying - but it is important that it be linked to our demographic situation and our future, above all in relation to immigration."
"There was recently a debate on this issue in your government, moreover, between hardliners and advocates of a more intelligent, human policy."
"We believe that Thessaloniki has been a very important step."
"With regard to another constitutional issue, which concerns us because it was a resolution approved by the whole of this House, including the votes from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: at the end of last year we expressed the need to implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in relation to freedom of expression and, specifically, in relation to the media at European level, in order to counteract the growing disparity between the national anti-concentration rules and in order to guarantee the rights of the citizens."
"This is a Green Paper which was produced by the Commission ten years ago and has yet to bear fruit."
"We believe it is important - given the prospect of an enlarged Europe and in the interests of guaranteeing these fundamental rights - that we work on this."
"I would also point out, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this does not bear any relation to an issue we faced when you were a Member of Parliament: the issue of the waiving of immunity in relation to a case in my country."
"What we are proposing is the development of a constitutional right for all Europeans."
"Finally, Mr President, I will refer to foreign policy."
"If you continue the work of the Greek Presidency with regard to transatlantic relations, we would consider that to be positive and we also believe that an important role can be played through the Quartet in the Middle East."
"I would ask you to act like Mrs Rice, that is, when you go to the Middle East, not to talk only to the Israelis."
"She has had no problem talking to everybody."
"Why should an important European have such a problem?"
"I very much appreciate what you have said in relation to Latin America, which is also a transatlantic issue, and above all in relation to Mercosur."
"I will end by thanking you for your generosity and by talking about Italians: when the Treaty of Rome 'II' is signed at the Campidoglio, I am sure that my group colleague and Mayor of Rome, Mr Veltroni, will be very happy to receive the Italian President-in-Office of the Council."
"I can assure you, Mr Berlusconi, that we will not be partisan and we will judge your Presidency on the facts, on what you can do, and not just on promises."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President-in-Office, until last night your programme was available only on your website and only in Italian and it is still now available only in Italian and English."
"While I have the good fortune to use a computer and to read both languages, some colleagues do not."
"I hope this is not a presage."
"Your primary task will be to convene the IGC to examine the draft Constitution."
"My group shares your ambition to finish this work as soon as possible, and in good time before next year's elections."
"We trust that you will provide adequate representation of the European and national parliaments whose involvement in the Convention helped make it such a success."
"But the future of Europe is up to the Member States."
"If they continue to fight over it, it will be not a Treaty of Rome - not even a Treaty of Dublin - but perhaps a Treaty of Utrecht, representing peace through exhaustion."
"Liberal Democrats agree with your priorities on the European economy."
"Our economy is in a bad way; the German motor of European growth is stalling."
"So initiatives to revive growth are welcome."
"Yet the completion of the trans-European transport networks must be viewed as a means to an economic end - the smoother functioning of the internal market - and not as an end in itself."
"As a British Liberal, I am delighted by the fidelity of your programme to John Maynard Keynes, and my delight is matched only by my surprise."
"However, I hope you agree that the spending you propose on TENs and on defence must be compatible with Member States' commitments under the Stability Pact, which is already under great strain."
"For Liberals the continuing value of Keynes lies in his insistence on solidarity."
"Your programme speaks much of consumers, but we are citizens first and foremost."
"Market ideology tricks people into equating buying power with voting power, and it robs us of the civic freedom by which we control the social consequences of our private choices."
"Where regulation is needed is where the gains from remedying market failure for citizens or the environment outweigh the costs of government intervention."
"In Italian political debate this is the difference between liberalismo, in which we believe, and liberismo, which we very much reject."
"My group supports the closer cooperation you propose with countries around the new borders of the EU, but we should not offer false hope of membership to our neighbours."
"Closer relations with the Union must be linked to democracy, respect for human rights and development of a market economy."
"We particularly welcome your emphasis on the Euro-Med partnership, which has long been a Liberal priority, and your plans for Albania, where Italy can surely show a lead."
"Your programme's proposals on transatlantic relations, which are on the mend after the breakdown caused by the crisis over Iraq, and your aim to rebuild ties with America are welcome."
"However, while seeking common ground with the United States, we must not shy from speaking up for Europe's interests where we disagree, and we welcome the strength of your statement on the International Criminal Court"
"On the Middle East too, the Union must project its voice in the Quartet strongly and clearly."
"Assistance in rebuilding the Palestinian economy must be conditional on action against terrorism, as improved cooperation with Israel must be conditional on progress in implementing the road map, notably on dismantling settlements."
"On agriculture and on immigration, Liberal Democrats find much less in common with your priorities."
"These two policy areas are linked."
"You say very little in your programme about CAP reform and yet at present every cow in Europe gets a subsidy of EUR 2 a day, while one billion of our fellow citizens worldwide must survive on less than EUR 1 a day."
"Unless we open our markets to farm produce from developing countries, their people will vote with their feet."
"The policies you propose on justice and home affairs seek mainly to prevent immigration."
"They will not work because you cannot beat the law of supply and demand which operates in labour markets like elsewhere."
"When you tell us you are concerned about Europe's reputation 'Cercheremo di fare bella figura per l'Europa', lei ha detto, please bear in mind that white Caucasians are in a minority on our planet."
"We hope that you will be guided in justice and home affairs by the balanced approach of the Greek Presidency, rather than by the tenor of Seville."
"Mr President-in-Office, your country assumes the presidency following a highly successful Hellenic Presidency, marked by the search for compromise and agreement."
"Liberal Democrats in this House hope that in your tenure in the Chair you will, in your words and actions, respect the dignity of the office and honour Italy's traditional European vocation."
"Mr President, a number of us feel a particular affection for Italy, for the extraordinary vitality of its society, the creativity of its people, its exceptional cultural heritage and the richness of its local, socially aware democracy."
"We love the Italy of the great popular demonstrations demanding employment, social justice and equality; of the vigorous anti-war movement; of the socially aware demonstrations in Genoa against social and police violence; and of the European Social Forum in Florence. It is an Italy that is young, demanding, enthusiastic and combative because it is convinced, as emphasised by its main watchword, that another Europe is possible and because it is determined to bring it about."
"This other Europe is one which provides itself with the resources to loosen the grip of neo-liberal globalisation in order to make employment, training, retirement and social welfare more secure for its citizens, to guarantee proper public services and to improve the standard of living - in short, to place people's lives above the demands of the market."
"This other Europe is one founded upon ethics and equality before the law, one that banishes elitism and exclusion, prohibits privileges and submission and eradicates the poison of intolerance, racism and xenophobia from within our societies, as well as from Europe's relations with the rest of the world."
"This other Europe is one emancipated from US tutelage and daring to make another voice heard in the great international institutions in order, together with its allies from the South, to tackle the open wounds that make the planet less and less safe and habitable and that go under the names of poverty, underdevelopment, environmental disaster and war."
"Like ourselves, this fine, unbiddable Italy does not identify with current European Union trends. With all the more reason, it is disgusted by the policies of those in government in Rome who are carrying European trends to the point of absurdity."
"Their neo-liberalism is unrestrained, their Atlanticism unconditional and their taste for democracy rather half-hearted."
"One of the priorities of this Presidency is a mammoth project to develop infrastructure."
"This would warrant careful examination on a case-by-case basis, for blatant needs do, in fact, exist, like that for a 'piggyback programme' on a scale appropriate to the EU."
"Relying upon private capital to carry out such work that will only be profitable in the very long term is, however, to head towards certain failure in the areas of employment, growth and quality of services."
"Another of this Presidency's priorities is to force the pace at which advantages in terms of pensions and social welfare are dismantled."
"This is the trademark of the most conservative forces."
"As for the plans relating to immigration and the right of asylum, which need to be finalised in the course of the next six months, revulsion is the only possible response to the idea that this ultra-sensitive debate might be sullied by the barbarous cries of rage to which one of the personalities in the current coalition is frequently given."
"We finally learned yesterday that formal decisions will have to be taken between now and December concerning the EU's new strategic doctrine which, when outlined before the start of the Italian Presidency, had already elicited great fears."
"Therefore, extreme vigilance will be required in all respects throughout these six months."
"If the current constitutional process is to have any meaning, let us begin by ensuring compliance with Article 2 of the draft Constitution, devoted to the values of the EU and worded as follows: 'The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"These values are common to the Member States in a society of pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity, and non-discrimination'."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, as we know, Europe is a continent of widely differing peoples and cultures, but one thing is certain: there is nothing surprising in the concern which has greeted your arrival at the helm of the Union."
"Italy is tainted with a stain which could well spread to the rest of the new Union: an extraordinary concentration of power, primarily economic and media power but also political power, which has placed you in a position, inter alia, where you are now above the law."
"However, we realise that just continually protesting will not suffice: we prefer to act."
"During these six months too, we will continue to urge the Commission to respect its undertaking to present a communication on the degree of pluralism of the media in the Union and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties."
"Indeed, we feel that Italy is rather hesitant, so to speak, when it comes to enforcing the 'Television without Frontiers' directive."
"We have fought to have pluralism included among the founding values of the new European Constitution, so that the lack of a legal basis can no longer be used as an excuse not to take action in Europe regarding media concentration and pluralism."
"At a time of economic crisis, it is usual to endeavour to find ways of boosting the economy."
"We know that Italy has extremely creative ministers who are anxious to expound their ambitious plans for bridges, tunnels and motorways at European level."
"We are ready to enter into constructive dialogue on TENs and the role of the EIB, but we must be under no illusion."
"It is not true that only three of the 14 projects decided on at Essen were executed because of a lack of funds: if there were not enough investors, one reason is that the appropriateness, socio-economic viability and - we would add -environmental sustainability of many of those projects were not guaranteed."
"We must recapture the spirit of the Delors plan and two powerful principles contained in the Commission's White Paper on Transport Policy, which I am afraid we sometimes all appear to disregard: investments must serve not just to fill Europe with infrastructure but to promote economic and social cohesion too."
"We must banish the idea that economic growth must of necessity go hand in hand with transport growth, for, otherwise, we will soon find ourselves stuck in a permanent traffic jam."
"It makes no sense to spend EUR 6 billion on the Messina bridge to shorten journeys by half an hour when thousands of Sicilians are without drinking water and it takes three hours to complete a 100-km journey by train."
"It makes no sense to invest 15 years of work in a 54-km tunnel for the Turin-Lyons link, drilling a hole through a mountain full of asbestos, when modernising and enhancing the present line would make it possible to absorb twice as much freight traffic in five years."
"We do not want to discuss grandiose projects which may not be achievable - we want investment which promotes innovation, renewable energies and land regeneration with regard to which the participation and acceptance of the citizens living in the areas concerned are seen as an asset rather than an annoying obstacle."
"President-in-Office, your European programme states clearly in black and white that we must open a new season and that we must combat environmental bureaucracies."
"This is an interesting circumlocution, which we believe refers to the desire to extend to Europe a principle which is in great vogue in Italy - total deregulation."
"We will oppose this attempt to export Italian produce, which is particularly risky at the time of enlargement, for it directly serves the policy of making everything subservient to infrastructure and is based on an antiquated concept of the environment as a commodity to be used and sold off."
"Italy is second only to Spain when it comes to breaches of environment legislation."
"Your government, President-in-Office, has changed the laws on waste so as to make monitoring more difficult, even though 11 million tonnes of waste are lost without trace and the turnover of the ecomafia is estimated to be around EUR 2.5 billion every year in Italy. It has weakened the laws on the assessment of environmental impact so much that it has become purely a formality."
"It has consented to the indiscriminate promotion of hunting in parks by regional authorities. For this year, it has appropriated EUR 56 million for protected areas, which is less than the cost of building 1 km of motorway tunnel."
"It is preparing to decriminalise environmental offences across the board."
"In all this, it is disregarding Community law. In this matter too, as in the issue of the media, we feel that this is a situation specific to Italy."
"President Prodi, in a sector in which the Union has genuine competences and international responsibilities, we fear that the unnecessarily complicated infringement procedure is no longer sufficient, and that by maintaining an excessively tolerant attitude and giving more consideration to the details of form than to substance we are in serious danger of helping to render Community legislation on the environment completely ineffective."
"President-in-Office, as regards foreign policy, we would all like to benefit from your excellent relations with President Bush, but certainly not to organise an impossible contest in military expenditure, maybe reducing contributions to development cooperation organisations in order to fund the Italian presence in Iraq."
"A fundamental dispute has arisen with the Bush administration over the International Criminal Court."
"We would like to know, President-in-Office, whether you are going to press ahead with and update the action plan for the Court, which was adopted in May 2002."
"Then you are on excellent terms with President Putin."
"Once again, it is our genuine hope that we will all be able to benefit from this friendship."
"You have listed all the countries in the world: how can you forget Chechnya?"
"We need incisive action to bring about resolution of this conflict."
"We must adopt an initiative, and we will support you if you do so, with a view to convening a regional conference for the Caucasus in which all the current conflicts can be addressed without fail."
"Moreover, President-in-Office, we believe that we and you would be proud if you succeeded in persuading President Putin to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"One final word on the European Constitution."
"We will support the Italian Presidency's endeavours to achieve a short Intergovernmental Conference so as not to disperse the - moreover, few - positive results of the Convention. However, President-in-Office, you must keep nuclear energy out of the Constitution, and I call upon the deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fini, to help us keep it out."
"Just as for GMOs, it would be unwise to underestimate the negative reaction of the citizens of many European countries, Italy included, when faced with the explicit promotion of such a costly, dangerous source of energy, as is currently contained in the Constitution."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, a constantly-changing society demands from politics new debates, the ability to take rapid decisions and, above all, the willingness to reflect deeply, with full knowledge of the facts, on the geopolitical and different economic and cultural situations which, in some respects, contribute to the ever-widening gap between north and south and between citizens."
"As a member of the Convention, I would like to express my satisfaction and the satisfaction of the Group which I have the honour of representing in that forum - the Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations - with a text which recognises the value of the national States in the new European Union: a Union which we hope will have stronger and more transparent institutions after the Intergovernmental Conference, which can prove to the world that the European Union exists as a model of civilisation and development."
"A civilisation which wants to see its values recognised without wishing to abuse the values of other cultures; development which must be compatible with the rate of adaptation of man."
"It is our hope that, with regard to the preamble, the Intergovernmental Conference will come to an agreement on the acknowledgement of the roots from which the Union has sprung to life."
"The ancient history of Greece and Rome, the Judaeo-Christian traditions and the secular, liberal values which came gradually to be established cannot be disregarded because it is from them that the future of Europe is drawing cultural and moral strength."
"We can see, moreover, that it would be appropriate to reflect once again on the need for there to be a European Commissioner for each Member State, in order to achieve greater cohesion between all the institutions."
"The Constitutional Treaty will, at last, give rise to a politically cohesive, free, independent Europe which respects the languages and traditions of each nation."
"The Italian Presidency has some extremely arduous tasks ahead of it and we are confident that, in the spirit of cooperation that it will foster with the other European institutions, with the Members of the European Parliament, the elected representatives of the people, it will give fresh impetus to the process of unifying Europe and to Europe's role in the world."
"The urgency of the migration issue demands an overall view."
"As I had occasion to write on the eve of the Thessaloniki Summit, only Europe, not least through a new Mediterranean policy and, at last, adopting a new principle of cooperation with the poorest countries, will be able to stop illegal migration of biblical proportions becoming a collective tragedy."
"I look forward to the European border police corps and the new agreements with third countries, I look forward to reinforced cooperation in combating organised crime, terrorism and fundamentalism, but the issue of a European approach to the globalisation of the markets must be addressed too, to prevent cultures and traditions becoming fragmented and dying out."
"A healthy social market economy cannot continue to accommodate unrestrained financial speculation such as that we have witnessed in recent years, which has broken out intermittently without there being any attempt to destroy its roots, to eradicate its causes."
"The health of the economy also depends on the parameters governing our actions, and one good parameter is that the financial economy must move at the same rate as the real economy."
"Europe cannot disregard the fact that the mobility necessary to allow the economy to develop further is dependent on two requirements: cultural education, which provides young people of all nations with the basis for mutual understanding - which means the national governments will have to address the need to provide more and better information on the activities of the European institutions - and the question of accommodation, which cannot be the responsibility solely of individuals or the private sector but to which the institutions too must help to find a solution; likewise, infrastructure- and transport-related issues need solutions at both national and European level, and so we would point out again here the need for rapid completion of Corridor 5 and Corridor 8."
"To combat the new forms of poverty which are emerging increasingly in the countries of the Union, we feel that it is vital for Europe to have a stronger energy policy which, based on seeking new sources and more efficient use of known sources, goes hand in hand with preserving those environmental values without which the very life of the planet would be endangered."
"At the same time, the issue of funding for research must be addressed: without substantial increases European research will not reach a level of excellence, with all the predictable ensuing consequences."
"In this connection, a more effective European food safety policy becomes particularly important in order to safeguard the quality of products and to protect their origins, thus safeguarding the citizens' health, which is the Union's main asset."
"Today, Europe is called upon not just to uphold the right to life of its citizens and of all human beings but to send out the message that all people have the right to a dignified life."
"Indeed, in the third millennium, all the most highly developed communities are, in any case, being called upon to take the political, cultural and economic measures necessary both within and outside their states to ensure that the tragedies we are witnessing do not continue."
"Children in Afghanistan currently have the lowest life expectancy in the world. Like millions of other children - in Africa, South America and the Middle and Far East - they are deprived of the right to life and the right to a dignified life."
"The relentless combating of terrorism and the consolidation of peace are dependent, not least, upon Europe's ability to deliver what it has promised over the course of recent years: the right to a dignified life, Mr President, not least in order to put an end to practices involving physical mutilation, to which many women are subjected in their countries of origin, suffering this abuse in Europe too."
"The Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations also expects from the Italian Presidency policies seeking to combat forms of discrimination, to crack down on traffickers of arms and human beings and to destroy the arcane, yet powerful world of child abuse."
"These criminal organisations have unrestricted, unregulated use of the Internet, which they use to spread their evil culture throughout the world."
"We therefore call for the drawing up of rules to stop a tool which exists to facilitate communication between citizens being transformed into a tool for use by those who violate the laws of the national states of the Union."
"In order to stop this happening, every technological invention must be subject to a European screening process, a scientific experimental control process which provides the guarantee that it is safe to use."
"Mr President, if freedom is to be true freedom, there have to be rules: a small number of clear, enforced rules."
"We appeal to these rules in the hope that the Italian Presidency will enjoy today the good will and cooperation of the European Parliament, the Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations and of all 25 countries which make up our great Europe."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, Italy insists that the Intergovernmental Conference must be ready to begin by December so that President Berlusconi can issue invitations to the Rome Summit and solemnly bury the Treaty of Rome and give birth to the Rome Constitution."
"A serious constitution cannot be devised as quickly as that."
"When the EU is equipped with common citizenship, fundamental rights and a whole charter of rights that can be invoked directly before the courts, the character of the whole cooperative enterprise is altered, and every single provision of Title III is to be read in a new light and can acquire new significance."
"To cite just one example: when the Treaty of Maastricht introduced common citizenship, it was expressly stated in writing that citizenship had no direct effect."
"The judgments of the Court of Justice nonetheless caused citizenship to be of direct effect, and people are now free to settle anywhere in the EU and have their rights further extended by means of the many fundamental principles in Title I of the Constitution and Title II of the Charter."
"The people and the elected representatives should be aware of all the consequences of the Constitution before it is adopted."
"This will require a large number of working parties, opportunities to table amendments and transparent democracy."
"What would the Constitution mean, for example, for the Danish summer house protocol?"
"Denmark prohibits Germans from purchasing summer houses in the way that Danes can."
"This quite clearly contravenes the ban on national discrimination under Article 4 and the principle of equality under Article 44."
"Can two such fundamental principles be set aside by an exemption, in the form of a protocol, to the rules governing the free movement of capital?"
"Is there a hierarchical relationship between the fundamental principles and the other provisions in the Constitution and protocols?"
"Alternatively, take Article 51, which protects the structure of the churches."
"Denmark can in this way retain a Protestant state church, but can Article 51 also lift the ban on religious discrimination in Article 2, paragraph 21 of Title II?"
"Is the Danish constitution lawful or unlawful?"
"It would be nice to know the answer before the Constitution is signed."
"Article 12(2) renders the majority of all the international agreements unlawful, for the EU would be given not only shared competence but also sole competence to enter into any agreement if only an internal act were affected."
"Ought it not at least to be stated in writing that all existing agreements shall continue in force until such time as they are altered?"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a practical look at what is already happening."
"We must measure in this way, with intellectual honesty and, I believe, this form of cooperation, any difference between what is said and what is done."
"On 7 June, Mr Berlusconi, in Jerusalem, you said, and I quote: 'In the future, Europe must include Israel."
"I repeat: 'In the future, Europe must include Israel."
"This is the official wording of the written document we have."
"'In this context,' (the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership) - and I quote - 'we shall not neglect the need to consolidate relations with Israel with the prospect of more extensive and structured reciprocal cooperation'."
"This is the line taken by those who oppose Israel's entry into the European Union, for, clearly, those who are opposed do not say 'We don't want these dirty Jews'; they say 'Cooperation is enough'."
"We support Mr Berlusconi who, at that time, was not yet President-in-Office of our Council."
"Similarly, as regards Turkey, we have always heard Russia, Turkey and Israel specified."
"Here, too, your text explicitly denies the goal of Turkey's accession."
"What does it say? 'The Italian Presidency furthermore considers it essential to inject more specific content into relations with the Russian Federation' and so on."
"This is quite clear. As regards Turkey, '? we are engaged in jointly monitoring its path to integration, encouraging the Government in Ankara to continue its efforts in the fundamental process of internal reforms.'"
"And that is supposed to herald its accession!"
"It is true that Mr Buttiglione has said in recent days that Turkey is a military regime which can never become part of the European Union, but without the soldiers it becomes a theocracy. This is Christian Europe!"
"I would just like to say one thing very briefly, and we must admit it."
"It is not true that there is a history of Europe - just one: there are many."
"There is the history of the Reformation and the Counter Reformation, there is the history of a Europe which produced victorious communisms and victorious fascisms and nazisms, which produced, and still produces today, antidemocracy."
"Then there is the other history, the history condemned, I regret to say, by our Polish Pope when he condemns liberalism."
"By the way, it is liberalismo, Mr Watson, not liberismo: here we have had liberalism for a century."
"There is a Europe which is the Europe opposed to our Europe of Altiero Spinelli, of Ernesto Rossi, of the Europe, Mr Berlusconi, which you heralded at the G8 in a way which I applauded."
"We Radicals applauded! We want to take Europe closer to the World Democracy Organisation and focus actively on the Community of Democracies."
"We applauded at the G8!"
"Today, of course, Mr Watson was quick to stress the Keynesian nature of your speech, but I have always maintained that, culturally, there is essentially great similarity between you and President Prodi when it comes to the political choices you make."
"Giulio Tremonti talks of 'Colbertism' rather than 'Keynesianism', but when all is said and done ?"
"There are just two things we have to ask from you, then."
"Firstly that, at the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union includes or brings about the inclusion, as Mr Fini announced, of the question of the moratorium on the death penalty. Secondly that, starting with the UN events, the Democratic Caucus representatives should be convened by the Presidency of the European Union."
"If you comply with these two requests then we will be more than content."
"As far as the rest is concerned, I wish you and us all luck."
"Mr President-in-Office, the problems we have to face at this moment are vital for the future of the Union and we intend to give them absolute priority."
"It is on these that we shall assess the work of your presidency."
"The concerns that have surrounded it, however, are not all due to prejudice."
"The unresolved conflict of interests remains a legitimate source of concern that extends well beyond our own country."
"In addition, the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ruggiero, had a significant effect on the way people understand Italy's role in Europe, the same Europe that Minister Bossi dubbed 'Forcolandia' ['Gallowsland'] because it is repressive, and which he has today branded a neo-Jacobin project, intrinsically authoritarian and globalising."
"Perhaps this accounts for your coolness towards working seriously on the construction of a European area of justice, freedom and security, starting with the European arrest warrant, which ought to be approved by December 2003."
"Major problems, I was saying: the Constitution, first of all."
"We ask that the next Intergovernmental Conference should not put the Convention's results forward for further discussion and that Italy should make every effort to improve the text on essential points, such as the extension of majority voting."
"On economic questions, we see that the Italian Presidency intends to relaunch the idea of public investment for infrastructure."
"We shall also add training, research and the environment."
"This proposal can only make headway if it adopts a truly European perspective, if it is firmly anchored in the Community method and is financially viable."
"With regard to pensions, you are well aware, Mr President-in-Office, that Europe has no competence in the field of social security schemes, which are so diverse and so closely tied in with welfare policies."
"Does the Presidency really mean to promote a European initiative in the economic and social field?"
"Well, then, it should do its best to have taxation and social policies brought within the Community's competence in the new Treaty, based on the guidelines of real European control of the economy, as this Parliament has been demanding for some time."
"In these matters, however, the method of consulting the social partners has to be followed, as laid down in the Lisbon strategy."
"As regards immigration, one cannot invoke just one piece of European policy - the part relating to frontier controls to combat illegal immigration - and ignore all the others, on the management of the influx and the reception and rights of those who, by coming here to seek work, contribute to the economic growth of our countries, those, let us be clear, whom your Minister for Reforms lumps together as 'Bingo Bongos'."
"Lastly, on the matter of foreign policy, it is possible to be both Europeans and friends of the USA."
"Friendship, however, is a relationship that must not fall into subservience."
"After the difficult Iraqi crisis, it is therefore even more urgent to define a sound common foreign and security policy, backed by overthrowing the right of veto."
"A clear framework for the Union's foreign relations was drawn up at Thessaloniki, distinguishing further prospects of enlargement from closer relations with our neighbours; in this context, after the contradictory statements that you and your Minister for European Policies have made regarding Turkey, we hope that what you told us this morning will stand."
"Similarly, for the Middle East, we hope that the peace process will be supported by the Italian Presidency, but to reach this goal it will be necessary to talk to and take into consideration all the parties involved."
"I wish you success in your work, Mr President-in-Office!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, today we are talking as Europeans; we do not bring to this House opinions on the internal politics of our countries."
"In the next six months Europe must start moving faster; the constitutional treaty for a Europe of 25 should make the world realise whether our continent will continue to be a driving force for economic and social progress and, after the serious Iraqi crisis, whether it will equip itself with effective means to take a leading role in matters of security and freedom in partnership with the United States, in a new multilateral cooperation."
"As a European, therefore, I hope for a successful Italian Presidency working in close collaboration with the Commission under Romano Prodi and with our Parliament."
"Today, Mr President-in-Office, you have been cautious and made an effort to present your programme along lines of collaboration with the other countries and not in discontinuity with Italy's traditional policy for Europe."
"We need to be bolder, however, if we do not want our compromises to slip away, especially as regards control of the economy, foreign policy and the necessary new defence policy, so as to minimise the risk of paralysis due to the need for unanimity."
"Over these six months we expect a radical change that can remove the reasons for all the criticism, scepticism and concern that have surrounded these first few days of the period with you at the helm."
"Indeed, it is not the internal politics of one country but all Europe that is calling for an end to conflicts of interest and media concentrations."
"It is the liberal fundamentals of the separation of powers and the balance among the powers as reflected in the European Treaties which we have freely signed and by which we are bound."
"The spirit of Rome of the 1957 Treaty was based on a daring vision of the future, and it constructed fifty years of democracy, prosperity and peace."
"If we are guided by that vision, even from alternative political positions, we shall harvest common fruits for the good of Europe and its future."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our aversion to your politics and your government, as you know, is deep-rooted, and it would not make sense for us to do a U-turn now that your politics are being applied to Europe and not just Italy."
"I think there is a rhetoric surrounding the six-month presidency of a nation, which cannot hide the political reality: the reality is that every presidency is the presidency of a government, not of a country; therefore, if people are against the Bush Administration it does not mean they are anti-American, and if people in Italy and Europe are against their government, it does not mean they are against Italy."
"Europe is, of course, an important episode; it is a challenge that has quite rightly been called historic."
"We are afraid that your government will aggravate rather than favour the necessary choices."
"You are starting with a handicap: in Italy the country's consensus is split, a major part of European public opinion is contrary (and I believe the causes lie precisely in your politics), the bases for the economic crisis in the country have been distorted, as it has been under severe strain with the conflict of interests and the conflict between the established powers."
"I personally feel the worst damage has been done by a minister in your government who can speak of the need to open fire on convoys of immigrants at sea."
"We shall not, however, protest about your government's presidency; we shall confine ourselves instead to criticising your politics, the bases of which are essentially the primacy of the United States of America and the primacy of the market."
"Both are factors of potential crisis for Europe: one, the United States, driven today by a doctrine of pre-emptive war; the other, the market, faced by a clearly developing crisis of social cohesion."
"You, Mr President-in-Office, have put forward a proposal for a transatlantic, neo-liberal, post-democratic Europe."
"We think this proposal goes against the vocation and historic mission of Europe today, of a Europe that needs another perspective."
"Someone spoke of a Keynesian policy;"
"I beg to differ: large-scale infrastructure is not a Keynesian policy; it may instead be a threat to the environment through deregulation, and it also runs the risk of not being completed because of the difficulties in financing it."
"There is another side to your politics, however, which is neo-liberal through and through: it is what we call job insecurity and you call flexibility; it is what is shown - as, indeed, in other European countries - in the attack on the social security system."
"This, Mr President-in-Office, is not Europe."
"The real Europe is the one calling for independence from US policies for the sake of a different political culture, the one calling for a different social model."
"Your strongpoint today is the weakness of political Europe, because the truth is that this political Europe is founded on a democratic deficit, and because I think that the Convention, too, is ambiguous and weak, a far cry from the great progressive constitutions."
"Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, we shall not oppose you for the sake of this Europe, but for the sake of another Europe: a social and democratic Europe."
"That is why our hope is - and please do not take this as a sign of hostility - that mass movement action in Europe will grow in both numbers of participants and importance during the Italian Presidency."
"There is just one thing on which we should like to be able to come together with you: in calling loudly for a moratorium on the death penalty."
"That, at least, would be a good sign of civilisation."
"Mr Berlusconi, I believe the most important task during the Italian Presidency will be that relating to the new constitutional treaty, which, let us recall, is not just concerned with ideas or concepts but addresses a territory and the people who live in that territory."
"The work the Convention has done is good work: the initial basis is sound, it may be that only a few adjustments will be necessary, such as a better definition of the balance of legislative powers between Europe, between the Union and the individual states."
"As for the problem of majority voting or unanimity in decision-making, we have to reconcile two needs: the need for efficiency and the need to respect the sovereignty and interests of the states that make up the Union."
"In your speech, you repeated the word 'negotiation' several times."
"I think some effort to reconcile different needs is also required in this area."
"Lastly, I should like to mention something which I do not think it will be possible to achieve but which I must highlight: the need for a reduction in the Commission's monopoly on legislative initiatives to the benefit of this House."
"Parliament does not have the right to initiate legislation - the only case in the world, I believe."
"Even a mere town councillor can table proposals, but Members of the European Parliament do not have this right."
"I believe this question at least deserves your attention."
"I too offer you my best wishes for your Presidency."
"Mr President, certain people should remember that we are debating today the programme of the Italian Presidency with which - and I am keen to point this out - I am essentially in agreement."
"I hope that throughout these six months, at all times in fact, we will be able to distinguish between domestic ideological differences and the institutional responsibilities such as those which the great country of Italy is now taking on."
"We take note, in this regard, of the commitment of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The main task of the Italian Government is to successfully organise the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) and to employ all its capacity for dialogue in order to bring the positions of the Member States together."
"In this regard, we are grateful for the commitment of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"The objective is for the IGC, in any event, to begin and end in Rome."
"Time periods here, Mr President, are very important so that the countries which decide to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution of Rome, allowing it to coincide with the European elections on 13 June 2004 - and I wish that were all of them - are able to do so."
"In this regard, Mr President, please allow me to take this opportunity to urge the political opposition in my country to agree to a reform by consensus of the rules governing the referendum so that such a vote may be possible, as we all wish."
"We would also like during this six-month period for strong impetus to be given to the negotiations for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and we call on the Presidency to do everything possible so that these negotiations may end within the time period of the current European legislature."
"In terms of the European Union's internal policy, we fully support taking further steps on the Lisbon strategy and continuing to make progress on the area of freedom, security and justice, particularly in combating illegal immigration, and in terms of the foreign policy of the Italian Presidency we hope that it relaunches the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in Naples and we welcome its commitments in this respect on the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, but in particular the relaunching of the idea of the Euro-Mediterranean Bank."
"And we would also urge you to promote progress in the negotiations with Mercosur which the WTO will promote and which your Italo-Argentinian compatriots will no doubt welcome."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we wish you the best of luck because success during these six months will be a success for Europe."
"Mr President, as an Italian and a Member of the European Parliament I feel embarrassed and worried but at the same time proud that my country, Italy, is today taking on the leadership of the European Union."
"I feel embarrassed at all the criticism, censure, sarcasm and derision levelled at my country for what has, I regret to say, quite rightly been called the Italian anomaly, or the serious conflict of interests that involves our Prime Minister."
"I also feel humiliated, because I recognise indeed that, whenever our Prime Minister expresses an idea, illustrates a proposal or presents a measure on the economy, finance, information or especially justice, we never know whether in doing so he is thinking of our interests or his own and those of his friends."
"Or rather, we in Italy know only too well, unfortunately, given what he has done up to now."
"I am worried because I do not want the conflict of interests virus that is humiliating Italian democracy to spread to a European level, because this is the real cancer for democracy, Mr Berlusconi, not the work of the judges, as you foolishly stated the other day."
"I am, however, also proud - yes, proud - because, thank God, Italy's institutions are not just made up of the Prime Minister and the friends he has brought in with him, especially in the Italian Parliament."
"That is why I am sure that Italy's leadership of the European Union will, as a whole, with the involvement and collaboration of all the institutions, including the oppositions, rise to the occasion despite the Italian anomaly, which I am glad to say is transient."
"Mr President, Italy, which so long ago was among the founders of the European Community, today has the great task of taking Europe fully into its historic continental enlargement and the launching of its first Constitution."
"This is our hope and also our commitment but, frankly, it is bad for Italy and for Europe that the person who is to represent us during the coming six months is Silvio Berlusconi."
"The whole of Europe knows that he represents an anomaly unparalleled elsewhere in the world."
"An immense weight hangs over him and his actions because of the ongoing conflict between his own personal interests and those of the people of Italy and Europe as a whole."
"He is the richest man in Italy: his immense economic power and his private affairs, which are present in every field of activity, conflict with the laws, the standards and the very principles of the State; they conflict with justice, and that is the truth."
"It is very sad for Italy and for Europe to have to read fierce criticism of him in the most respected newspapers in every country."
"You have all read it, ladies and gentlemen, so I will not repeat it: it is harsh criticism, but it is true."
"For all of us it is a cause of the greatest concern to see someone at the head of the Council who, during the war in Iraq, acted not to unite Europe but to divide it, by coming out against the feelings expressed by the vast majority of the people of Europe and once again adopting subservient positions towards the United States; someone who on international issues departs from the prevailing European line, on relations with Israel and Palestine, for instance, or the dramatic immigration question; someone who, on economic and social issues, starting with the attack on pensions, has espoused an extremely laissez-faire and deeply anti-popular line."
"Mr Berlusconi is the right, and the worst, most dangerous kind of European right, and I therefore have no illusions."
"Frankly, I expect the Berlusconi term of office will prove to be a total disaster."
"I hope at least that, in the interests of Europe and my homeland of Italy, the damage can be kept to a minimum."
"Let this be quite clear: for this reason we shall act decisively out of a pure sense of national responsibility and a staunch European spirit."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and in European society, there is a profound distrust of the Italian Presidency."
"Not because of Italy, of course, the foundation of our culture, of many of our languages and of the very idea of Europe, but because of the political personality of President Berlusconi."
"You, Mr Berlusconi, are one of the main representatives of the authoritarian right of our day, protagonist in the battle between the classes, internally and globally, between the rich and the poor and the workers."
"You even call people such as President Prodi, critical journalists and the judges who judge you 'communists'."
"You use antiquated language, even troglodyte language, forgetting which century you are in."
"You are a friend of Sharon against Arafat."
"This distrust was ratified by certain key elements in your speech today."
"You subordinate the constitution of the European Union to relations with the United States."
"You are unaware of the chaotic and tragic situation in Iraq, caused by governments friendly to you."
"You forget the Prestige disaster, which was suffered principally by my nation, Galicia."
"You underplayed the constant deaths of immigrants, off both our coasts and in your island of Sicily."
"You said nothing about the social Europe, about social and territorial cohesion, not even in view of the prospect of enlargement."
"You did not expressly defend the draft constitution."
"In Italy, Mr President, you were granted immunity."
"Here, as President-in-Office of the Council, you will not have it."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having welcomed, as is only right, your taking over the reins of the European Union, I must immediately express profound disagreement with the main emphasis you intend to give to your Presidency: that of positioning the European Union in the wake of the United States of America."
"The peoples of Europe do not want this and demonstrated as much during the war in Iraq."
"Nor is it the option favoured by the European institutions."
"Following the example of Parliament, commitment to a multilateral world under the aegis of the United Nations rather than that of the United States has been expressed by the Commission in the shape of Commissioner Patten and Mr Prodi - the former hardly a dangerous left-winger, the latter perhaps a little more in that vein - and even by the Council, or at least to all appearances."
"What Europeans are waiting for is the affirmation of their own European identity."
"Public opinion has come into its own on this matter, Mr Berlusconi."
"Do not disappoint it."
"What, indeed, would be the use of this would-be constitution which, whether it be a source of delight or indignation, is a considerable leap forward in the direction of European sovereignty, if our continent were to end up becoming the handmaiden of the US empire?"
"Mr President, given that this treaty is to be signed in Rome at the beginning of May 2004, I hope you will be very keen to propose to your colleagues in the Intergovernmental Conference that the peoples of Europe, as sole wielders of sovereignty and, therefore, as those who alone are in a position to relinquish such sovereignty, should vote on this Constitution in a referendum."
"Finally, the Ministerial Conference of the 'World Commercial Organisation' - a name I think is more apposite than World Trade Organisation - will be held in Cancun during your Presidency."
"In the same spirit, I do not want this meeting to be the opportunity for our old Europe, to which we are ultimately rather attached, to sacrifice its cultures, its ways of life and its Community on the altar of unrestrained free trade."
"Already, our agriculture has been more or less remodelled in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation."
"I fear that our cultures, our identities and our specific character, which has, moreover, given birth to world civilisations, might suffer the same fate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I want to begin by offering you our unqualified good wishes for a successful presidency."
"Recently the debate over the structure, the powers and the institutions of the European Union has come to dominate almost every European discussion."
"It therefore comes as a breath of fresh air to see that you have put the pursuit of the Lisbon strategy at the forefront of your policy objectives."
"We need to face up to the challenges of economic change and reform."
"At a time when Europe is facing deflation and stagnation, it is encouraging to see that you recognise the need to revive the process of major liberalisation of European economies."
"We need real action on the Lisbon strategy rather than empty rhetoric."
"The millions of unemployed throughout Europe want sustainable jobs, rather than our apparent obsession with institutional design and architecture."
"Jobs and prosperity will have a more direct and real impact on the lives of the people that we are here to represent than tinkering with EU institutions."
"Turning then to the IGC and the prospective new constitutional treaty, I urge you and your fellow Heads of State to return to the objectives that were set out in Laeken."
"You were amongst the European leaders who called for the Convention to bring the EU closer to the citizens."
"Some of us seriously question whether the outcome really achieves that."
"The European governments should have that Laeken statement firmly in their minds when they begin the negotiations in the IGC."
"Our political élites have always assumed that the only way that Europe can succeed is by regular, institutional change."
"But our enlarged Europe of 25 states should be a place where proper respect for the diversity of nation states is upheld and defended."
"Imposing a straitjacket of uniformity can only damage the true interests of unity in the EU."
"I also applaud the statement that you made in your priority objectives, in which you say your desire to complete the work of the IGC is dictated by respect for the values of democracy and transparency."
"We trust that you will keep to this in the intergovernmental negotiations that lie ahead."
"I would also like to clarify a matter I raised in Parliament with President Cox yesterday."
"The accession countries will be affected by the outcome of the IGC in the same way as the current 15 EU states."
"I note that they will participate in the IGC on an equal footing with current Member States."
"President Cox repeated that statement to me yesterday after my speech."
"But what does it really mean in practice?"
"Surely it should mean that the accession countries have a full and equal right to vote in the Council on the outcome of the IGC?"
"Perhaps you can confirm whether that is also your understanding."
"I also welcome your clear commitment to revive and reinvigorate the transatlantic relationship."
"Recent events have damaged the strong ties that exist between Europe and the USA."
"In a newspaper yesterday, you said that the West must be united."
"There cannot be competition between us and America."
"Given the growing strains between America and some countries in recent times, we are looking to you to take this priority forward as a high priority."
"We must ensure that the European Union in the defence field does not pursue objectives that lead to antagonism with the institutions of the NATO Alliance."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as an Italian Member of the European Parliament from the Movement of European Republicans in the ELDR Group and for Mr Martelli's Liberal Socialists, I can only hope that these six months will prove an assured success for Europe and for Italy."
"To solve the difficult tasks that lay ahead of you - from major infrastructure to pensions and illegal immigration - you will not be needing sensationalist television formats but intelligent, creative work of political mediation, in order to honour the commitment you have made before this Parliament."
"The profile of your actions must therefore be very high and focused on the major international options, most of all the new Constitution for the Twenty-Five, under which every step forward will be welcomed but no step backward will be allowed at all."
"Rebuilding a real partnership with the United States must start with a direct relationship with the European Union, with Europe gradually taking on responsibility and leadership in NATO, with a moderate, rather than antagonistic or subservient view of the relations."
"Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, we believe it is essential to encourage the United Kingdom to join monetary union so as to strengthen Europe at an international level."
"The other difficult test lying ahead of you is the solution to the Middle East problem, bearing in mind that the roadmap requires a highly impartial attitude, and therefore European intervention must not be directed to just one side."
"These are major challenges, Mr President-in-Office, for which, on behalf of myself and also our country, I wish you every success."
"Mr President-in-Office, if there is one thing that worries me about the situation in Europe - and we have had a few examples this morning - it is a type of politics that all too often appears to be self-referential."
"I am therefore sure - and the facts will confirm this - that your commitment to respond to the expectations of your European citizens every single day will mark out your Presidency."
"The rule in our speeches is to try to make a contribution to the reports."
"There is a great difficulty here, Mr President-in-Office, because the subjects dealt with have covered all our expectations."
"There is just one point to which I should like to call your attention: during the six months of the Italian Presidency the new rules on cohesion policies will be drawn up."
"In this context, I think the Italian Presidency should remind the European Union of a number of specific responsibilities, which are: to strengthen economic and social cohesion; to reduce the disparity in the development levels of many regions, which is still present in our Union and will be even more accentuated with enlargement; and to implement ideas of geographical solidarity, and in this respect we are thinking of the remoter regions."
"This is based especially on three principles: that without resources the cohesion policy will be difficult to implement; that the sectoral policies that the Union is developing - just think of the effects of the reform of the agricultural policy - should contribute to a great ideal of European cohesion; and that the new idea of European cohesion should also include the flexibility criterion."
"One last point, which my colleague Mr Tajani has already touched upon: all these policies will come together in the work of the IGC, confirming the Convention."
"Well, I believe a reference to the founding values of Europe, an explicit reference to Christian values, would be a contribution to our history."
"Mr President, in Italy you often maintain that you are exposed to political persecution by your critics."
"That will not happen in this House."
"Your work will, however, be scrutinised carefully, for there is no immunity in this House against political blunders and infringements."
"This autumn, the EU is to unite around an asylum and immigration policy based upon humanitarianism and shared humanity."
"That is something you did not say very much about in your speech, Mr Berlusconi."
"Success demands clear leadership that can act with legitimacy and authority."
"I must unfortunately ask myself the question as to whether the Italian Government really is capable of shouldering that responsibility today."
"One of your own ministers, mentioned earlier in this House, demands that the police use live ammunition upon refugees seeking freedom in your country."
"That is something you must now clearly reject."
"Your own role as Italian media proprietor has led to the government directing the content of both the private press and of public television."
"That is a very worrying development that affects the whole of the EU and that would not have been accepted if it had happened in any of the EU's new Member States."
"The gloomy question we now have to ask ourselves is whether Italy is a country that fulfils the political Copenhagen criteria."
"May you demonstrate that we critics and sceptics are wrong."
"I nonetheless wish you good luck over the next six months."
"Mr President, allow me to say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we have confidence in Italy's Presidency."
"We know that you will be able to combine political will and the spirit of conciliation in order to take European integration one stage further."
"In international affairs, transatlantic relations are obviously fundamental."
"The European Union's discussions with the United States, along the lines of those held recently in Washington, must become more regular."
"Issues such as environmental protection that are the subjects of conflict between the two sides of the Atlantic, should be approached on a more pragmatic basis."
"We share the opinion of the Italian Presidency on the need for a short IGC, examining, if possible as it stands, the draft constitution of the European Convention and, above all, not re-opening the Pandora's box of national requests."
"We are on the verge of adopting a common constitution drawn up in the full light of day."
"May we succeed in seizing this unique opportunity, and let us get ready for the new constitutional Treaty of Rome."
"Parallel to the enlargement of the EU, people need to feel safe within the borders of an EU alert to the external threats represented by illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism."
"From now on, we need to show the determination required to achieve the desires of the Thessaloniki Council."
"At an economic level, the Italian Presidency's plan to give new impetus to the trans-European network of road, rail and sea transport, as well as to the research and development project, is a necessity."
"As the French Prime Minister, Mr Raffarin, pointed out, the pact that links Europeans to one another is called the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We are therefore in favour of the European Union taking initiatives in the area of growth."
"As representative of the overseas regions, I would emphasise the importance, in terms of the EU's social cohesion, of doing everything possible to open up the regions far from the centre of Europe."
"European solidarity depends on such efforts."
"We can only encourage the new Presidency, in the run-up to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003, to develop its relations, particularly in the field of trade, agriculture, infrastructures and migration, in order to ensure that the Barcelona process does not run out of steam."
"Finally, we would keenly encourage any European or national policy designed to promote linguistic diversity."
"A Europe rich in 20 languages and as many cultures must not be reduced to a Europe of just one language."
"That requires effort on the part of everyone, however, and we await practical initiatives in this area from the new Presidency."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I shall let you into a secret: I prefer your own emollient presentation to the contribution, here in Strasbourg yesterday, by the French Prime Minister, whose game was one of national division."
"That said - and I imagine you will have realised the fact in the course of this debate - we shall judge you by your actions and not by mere words."
"You will also be aware that Parliament has high ambitions for a successful IGC, and it is the task of your presidency to bring it about."
"That is the ambition of Parliament and of my political group, in the service of a European democracy that operates at all levels, be it at European level or in each of our Member States, a democracy that respects this Charter of Fundamental Rights that we have just incorporated into the draft Constitution."
"I have just, very belatedly, come across your programme in English - I do not, unfortunately, read Italian - and I see that there is again talk of Jacques Delors's White Paper."
"I am delighted, because I think Jacques Delors was right."
"Since he proposed that the EU undertake this grand project of trans-border networks and European infrastructures, we are, quite simply, coming up against the same problem, namely that of funding."
"You raise the idea of funding by the EIB, but the EIB is still just a bank."
"You will find no solution other than a European loan."
"Are you prepared, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to fight for a European loan to fund this major work?"
"Otherwise, it will be a case of just words, words, words."
"At the end of the day, does this reinvigoration plan serve the cause of European growth or simply that of the Italian economy as it struggles to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact?"
"Mr President-in-Office, among the points on the agenda for the Italian Presidency, this Parliament has naturally paid particular attention to the Intergovernmental Conference, which should approve the Convention's draft."
"The Constitution will be an historic development recalling the 1957 Treaty of Rome."
"Parliament, however, expects a step forward on the majority vote and a common foreign policy, which it believes is the only alternative to American unilateralism and the most worthwhile basis for Euro-Atlantic understanding."
"I also hope there will be some thought about the fact that human values, which are clearly expressed in the clauses of the Constitution and are there to protect the European citizenry, have Christian roots."
"Christianity is no restriction to the secularity of politics."
"The Italian Presidency has the opportunity to incorporate the trans-European networks - which the Commission's priority projects have marked out as an objective for strengthening European territorial cohesion - into a broader programme."
"We must, however, allocate more resources to the research and innovation policy, as you, Mr Berlusconi, have said and Mr Prodi has confirmed, since the competitiveness of the European economy depends especially on this investment."
"This Presidency should, finally, put into practice the initiative outlined at Thessaloniki for an immigration policy that finds a steady balance between legality and reception; that is, one that upholds the values we read of in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Lastly, to reinvigorate Europe's Mediterranean policy, we must be aware that no initiative involving the southern Mediterranean countries can be successful unless it is based on a strong peace policy that guarantees the security of Israel but also a homeland for the Palestinians."
"I wish you success in your work!"
"Mr President, the Italian Presidency is proposing economic policy initiatives that are interesting and disconcerting at one and the same time."
"In fact, the Italian Government seems to be practising a gelato caldo, or 'hot ice', strategy."
"It talks in riddles."
"The Stability and Growth Pact should thus become both stronger and more flexible at the same time."
"There is talk of a 'Maastricht of pensions', a slogan that, at first sight, is devoid of meaning."
"President Berlusconi has just invited us to reflect upon the durability of European social welfare."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is fully aware of the problems at present posed by the contract between the generations."
"The fortunate increase in life expectancy, together with shorter working lives, have led to a decrease in the number of people actively employed, as compared with the number of retired people."
"That obviously presents a problem of funding for the public systems operating on a distribution basis."
"It may be seen, however, how private pension funds operating on a capitalisation basis experience similar problems."
"In the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, pension funds are accumulating losses and experiencing serious liquidity problems."
"Everywhere, companies are converting the basis of their pensions funds from one of defined benefits to one of defined contributions."
"In other words, employees know what they have to pay but are no longer aware of the money to which they will be entitled once they have reached retirement age."
"Does not this 'Maastricht of pensions' conceal a desire to reduce the public commitment where pensions are concerned?"
"The Presidency must clarify its real intentions in this matter as quickly as possible."
"The PSE Group will not, at any event, accept a pensions Waterloo."
"The proposals by the minister, Mr Tremonti, in favour of trans-European transport systems comply with a political priority defended by my group for years."
"As the concept is not very clear and as the funding is by no means assured, it is difficult, however, to see what might be the impact upon the European economic situation of bringing about future trans-European networks."
"As President Ciampi said - and I shall conclude at this point - there will be no stability without growth and no growth without stability."
"Growth and stability are the two motors that will enable the European economy to move forward."
"Mr President, I want to wish the Italian Presidency every success."
"Taking place, as it is, at an extremely important time for the future of Europe, I want it to be harmonious and effective at one and the same time."
"I support what has already been voiced by a number of other speakers, namely the wish to allow a new constitutional treaty to see the light of day during this Presidency."
"Italy is a great European country."
"It is also a country of great Europeans, and I am sure that, faithful to this heritage, the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission and the Vice-President of the Convention will be very keen to agree upon essentials in order to give Europe a new face."
"This new Constitution that we shall adopt, I hope, by referendum will, as I see it, have one great virtue: that of finally existing."
"This fundamental text must, however, be a point of departure for a new Europe and not an end in itself."
"I also think that the next elections will be an opportunity for our fellow citizens to affirm their desire to go further in common European policies, whether it is a question of coordinating economic, budgetary, fiscal and social policies, of creating a Europe of defence and research or of defining a common foreign policy that can finally count for something in the world."
"That will be the next challenge for those who like this idea of a Europe that both unites and transcends us."
"The Italian Presidency will also have a great responsibility for making advances in the fields of education and culture."
"You will have to give further impetus to a Europe of knowledge, and I want us to be able to adopt the Erasmus Mundus programme as quickly as possible so that it might be put into effect no later than 2004."
"Finally, I would take the liberty of drawing your attention to the meeting of UNESCO's General Assembly in October 2003, which should tackle the draft international convention on cultural diversity."
"It is more than desirable that the EU should adopt a clear and public position on this draft."
"In conclusion, I want to express the wish that this Italian Presidency might be informed by the spirit of the signatories of the Treaty of Rome."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our timetable means that it falls to you to hold the Presidency during a six-month period which is key to the implementation of the European arrest warrant, a request of this Parliament, a request of my country, Spain."
"I would ask you please to do everything necessary to make it possible."
"The European Union must contribute its own approach to the fight against terrorism, particularly since we have seen recently that the military approach has its limitations."
"It also has it limitations in relation to the issue of immigration."
