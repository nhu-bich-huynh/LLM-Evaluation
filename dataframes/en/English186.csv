"But I shall return to this matter when I comment briefly on the amendments which have been tabled."
"This study - and indeed this initiative - starts from the premise that mountain regions account for 30 % of the territory of the EU and 20 % of its usable agricultural area, a sizeable proportion where life is extremely difficult, moreover."
"I would just remind you of some of the reasons why: altitude, first and foremost, gradients which make it hard to use mechanised farming methods, land fragmentation, poor soil fertility, depopulation and the ageing of the resident population, difficulties for communications and transport, remoteness from centres of habitation, constant environmental risks - making it difficult to plan for the future - and the need for basic infrastructures, roads, schools and general services."
"Mountain regions have a cross-cutting role which not only affects those who live in them: environmental protection and land management, hydrogeological monitoring, the promotion of agri-tourism, improved utilisation of resources, stabilisation of low-lying areas - it is not a commonplace to say that, in many instances, city defences lie in mountain regions - and also, where appropriate, cross-border cooperation and the management of forestry and grazing activities."
"These considerations give rise to certain proposals, not to say pointers for reform, which in general terms lie within two spheres of prime concern to the European institutions as a whole: the first is safeguarding jobs - given that we have undertaken to create new employment, let us try not to lose existing jobs - and the second is environmental protection, a commitment which underpins all the reforms."
"But if this approach is to succeed, it must above all be global, integrated, coherent and sustained, not based on one-off measures."
"As I indicated earlier, the European Union has already adopted a strategy for lessfavoured areas, which include not only mountain regions but also Arctic areas and coastal areas threatened by desertification."
"This own-initiative report paves the way to two other possible in-depth studies, attesting to the fact that the legislator's job is to design a broad avenue, from which pathways branch off into the real heart of the matter."
"Mountain regions are one aspect of the matter; Arctic areas are another, and are the subject of an own-initiative report to be presented very shortly by Mrs Anttila."
"At some future date, perhaps during the next parliamentary term, someone might turn their attention to coastal areas threatened by desertification."
"Thus it is quite unnecessary to address ourselves to the issue in its entirety on every occasion: that would be a retrograde step, a pretext for more solemn declarations of principle and sweeping proposals, but without indicating in practical terms and in detail how to get to the very heart of the matter and produce tangible measures."
"So, what tangible measures do we mean?"
"I shall briefly mention a few of them."
"First and foremost, an integrated approach is required."
"The rural population should be encouraged to stay on the land by granting them fixed - not unpredictable - additional income for ecological and social services over and above what must remain their main activity, namely farming."
"The main regulations having an impact on mountain areas should be published in a single volume, thereby creating an EU mountain code."
"Seminars should be held to explore the issues in greater detail, the Commission should draw up a communication for the Council on EU mountain regions, and on that basis a Community action plan for mountain areas should be produced."
"Lessons could be drawn from pilot projects under the TERRA and LEADER programmes, and a whole series of other initiatives is required."
"They can be examined in detail by Commissioner Fischler, to whom I - as rapporteur - now hand over this study, so that it may be taken into account when charting the new course of rural development in the context of Agenda 2000."
"Madam President, our group welcomes these two Commission reports on Regulations 2087 and 2080."
"Mr Otila said that both reports were drawn up too hastily;"
"I fear that the opposite is true, and that they have come along rather late in the day."
"The regulations on the CAP accompanying measures date back to 1992; now, in 1998 and six years on, this is our first across-the-board assessment of these measures."
"I think that such innovative initiatives, which were so full of significance when they were first presented, would benefit from more regular monitoring, bearing in mind that this is a fastchanging area, in constant need of updating and revision."
"As Mr Iversen said, the problem is the lack of critical assessments of the effectiveness of these measures: this loophole must be closed, and such assessments must be made public."
"We must have all the necessary information on how these substantial financial resources have been used, not least because we must now start to look at new proposals. I am sure that those who advocate the greening of the CAP need very sound facts and arguments, because many people object to a renewal along environmentalist lines of traditionally market-oriented policies."
"I would encourage the Commissioner to proceed on the basis of these initial experiences."
"The new regulation on rural development does include the actions contained in Regulations 2078 and 2080, and yet we have three areas of doubt."
"Firstly, as Mr Iversen says in his report, the financial allocation for the new accompanying measures is still somewhat meagre."
"In certain circumstances, the compensation paid will probably be too limited to meet the need, which is why we should perhaps consider cofinancing these measures at differential rates."
"Secondly, Regulation 2080 is still overshadowed by the ambiguity concerning Community actions relating to forestry per se - it is true that the Community has no direct competence here, but we said in the Thomas report that a whole series of measures could be introduced at Community level - and compensatory allowances for non-food production, for example that of timber."
"I believe that this reminds the Commission of the need to present specific proposals on forestry policy."
"Thirdly, the new Agenda 2000 proposals provide for cross-compliance which is left rather too much to the Member States' discretion."
"Subsidiarity is all very well, but should not be taken to such lengths."
"The track record of Regulations 2078 and 2080 should be assessed, maintaining some common rules which leave scope for independent initiative by the Member States."
"Turning to mountain regions, I should like to compliment Mr Santini: his report paints a picture of mountain regions which is more than just a postcard view, and which we now need more than ever before."
"Many points are set out, and I would merely add that these initiatives should not be taken at Community level alone."
"Indeed, I always fear that we expect rather too much of the Community."
"They must be carried out in tandem by the Member States and regions, because the new thinking behind the CAP is to give the regions greater freedom of planning within their own confines, taking account of all the areas which have physical and natural handicaps and therefore need special help and consideration."
"Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, the agricultural environment programmes of the European Union have met with widely varying responses from one Member State to another."
"A scientific analysis conducted in Germany to assess the approval rating of the EU agricultural environment programmes highlights this very clearly."
"In your home country, Commissioner, 86 % of farmers welcome such programmes."
"The acceptance rate in Germany stands at 30 %, while the figure for France is 17 %."
"Three years after the entry into force of this environmental regulation, the Commission has now presented the European Parliament and the Council with an assessment of the way in which the regulation has been applied."
"The rapporteur, Mr Iversen, on whose report my remarks are chiefly based, has generally tended to adopt a somewhat critical tone, to my mind, in his report."
"He points to weaknesses in the aims of the regulation, which he feels should be more stringently defined, as well as calling for clearer details of the quantitative improvements to be achieved by farmers when they implement the programmes."
"One of his demands is that the agricultural environment programmes should be far more strongly result-oriented."
"This may mean that further increases in grants and incentives will be needed in particular sectors, and perhaps a little more democracy too."
"At the present time, there are ceilings on the grants that can be cofinanced from Community funds."
"However, it may be necessary to adjust these ceilings in accordance with actual requirements."
"In my view, Member States which developed and implemented their own agricultural environment programmes even before the reform of the common agricultural policy have a certain advantage in terms of experience."
"The main reason for the varying acceptance levels of agricultural environment programmes in the EU is not a lack of willingness among some farmers to take part in the programmes, but rather the financial priority and organisational resources that the Member States feel able to assign to the creation and planning of such programmes."
"In my home region, the farmers already have quite some experience of these things."
"There was undoubtedly a great deal of resistance to begin with, but I believe that the subject has now been aired as thoroughly as possible."
"The greatest quantities of newly formed groundwater have been found under farmland."
"Who has ever mentioned that?"
"In areas where the whole countryside is under cultivation, the production of drinking water is another major contribution of the farming community, alongside the other contributions - food production and care and conservation of the agricultural landscape - that we never tire of citing."
"That is why I believe it makes sense for us to deal jointly with these reports on forest and mountain regions in terms of these factors too."
"For these important reasons, I too am committed to ensuring that agricultural activity is maintained in naturally disadvantaged regions as well as in good farming areas."
"To that end, transfer payments are necessary and warranted."
"In conclusion, may I say that one of the aims of the agricultural environment programmes is to strengthen the farming economy, with its wealth of useful functions, in peripheral areas too."
"In that respect, Regulation No 2078/92 makes a very important contribution to the stabilisation of rural areas."
"Madam President, Commissioner, congratulations to my colleague on an excellent report."
"Agreements under measures contained in the CAP reform have been signed with only 17 % of all EU farms, and environmental aid is only going to five countries."
"The scheme must be made more attractive, such as by making it a condition for receiving aid."
"Environmental aid in the future can also be used to lessen the burden production places on the environment."
"Environmental protection and sustained development are becoming ever more important to consumers when they choose the food they buy."
"Sound principles are required for Europe's agricultural production if we are to achieve a sustainable base for high-quality European food, as Mr Mulder states in his report on food quality."
"The European Union will only succeed in the global food market in the area of high-quality produce."
"Mr Otila's report shows that the afforestation scheme has not worked out as expected."
"When Finland and Sweden joined the Union the northern coniferous zone became a brand new part of the area. Sustainable use of the forests, and their reform, have been the backbone of our economy for decades."
"As Mr Otila said, forestry in the future must operate according to the principle of the free market."
"Community policy must be responsible for coordination in order to produce benefits and added value for the sustained use and exploitation of forests in the EU area."
"EU action is needed to ensure, for example, that WTO negotiations cover the free access of the timber industry's products to global markets."
"The Union must also define the criteria for sustainable forest maintenance and reform for forestry products in the EU area, as only then can we prevent the introduction of certification that would increase the power of environmental organisations which are biased."
"Certification schemes are being developed all the time by Member States, and that is why we need an umbrella scheme at EU level to cover the individual systems."
"Proposals on this have already been put to you, Commissioner, and I would like to ask you this: when will you come up with a proposal for such an umbrella scheme?"
"Mr Santini's report deals comprehensively with the special problems of mountain areas."
"I can see that mountain areas and the Arctic region have very many problems in common with agriculture: a short growing season, vast distances, a sparse population, difficult growing conditions, and so on."
"The European Union can function in a sustainable way only by acknowledging differences, and taking greater notice of the different needs of the regions."
"I believe these reports now under discussion will be an excellent opportunity to give more weight to the whole question of differing needs in the regions, which undeniably exist in the vast area of the Union, and the report on mountain areas covers this in detail."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I have been given a mountain of minutes but I do not want to reach the very summit because I do not want to tire everyone else out if I climb that high."
"Nevertheless, I am going to be speaking about three reports: the Iversen, Otila and Santini reports."
"The Iversen report, of course, reveals extensive knowledge, especially of those agricultural areas with the luxury of being able to carry out more intensive forms of agriculture."
"That is not the case in my country, or in Greece, where in certain areas it is impossible to carry out intensive farming even if you wanted to - unless you want to set up industrial pig farms."
"There are, however, environmental differences and huge environment-related differences between the various countries."
"How can all of that be assessed?"
"By means of studies and asking university institutes and others to assess the situation as a whole."
"There is no doubt some countries cannot combine development with environmental protection."
"In others development only harms the environment."
"So who can decide?"
"That problem will not go away."
"Is some bureaucrat always going to decide what is good farming practice for me?"
"Of course, I do agree with Mr Fantuzzi when he says that we must have general rules for Europe as a whole."
"As for the Otila report it deals with an extremely useful aid measure."
"We all know that this is not enough to solve the forestry problem in Europe but it can, at least in countries like mine, withdraw certain marginal areas from production."
"But a study must be carried out into this, too: to see which varieties are planted in poor areas, whether those varieties will be of any economic value in the future and who should take decisions about those varieties in conjunction with the farmers themselves or about which marginal areas should be withdrawn from production."
"Who actually decides?"
"Money is needed and we must assess what has been done in each country."
"I am completely against the notion of taking under-used funding away from one country and giving it to another country that makes better use of it, because I feel that the Commission should also play an educative role and work in conjunction with the national governments."
"As far as my friend Mr Santini's report is concerned I have to say that Mr Santini is more Tyrolean than Italian."
"There is no doubt that he is much closer to Commissioner Fischler's land of yodelling than he is to the country of Italian ballads."
"That is why he has produced a report for the mountains - not for the Tyrol but for the Italian mountains that are an extension of the Tyrol."
"I know the poor mountains, the dry mountains, snowless mountains, mountains where farmers cannot double up as skiing instructors."
"That is why, out of my friendship for him and my great respect for his work in the European Parliament, I proposed that he should also look at mountains in arid and semi-arid areas."
"I succeeded in tabling some amendments and he kindly took them on board."
"Of course, in a previous parliamentary term, Mr Görlach drafted a report on the arid and semi-arid areas."
"But I think that they should be paid more attention because, as a rule, science pays attention to the rich areas because it is paid to do so."
"Science does not pay any attention to the poor areas because they do not have any money to pay for it."
"That is why I would call on the Commission to think about much more comprehensive studies of the real situation in Europe."
"I have now reached the top of the mountain and I do not want to go any higher."
"I shall stop there even though I have one more minute to go - but I did not want to bore you all stiff."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that the three reports that have been presented to us are particularly important when considering the Union's policies."
"In fact, they question which agricultural and forestry policies would be more ecological and would ensure the best use of land, as well as the maintenance and development of human activities."
"These issues are major concerns for our societies."
"They came to be of such concern through the rejection of productivity-based policies that weakened the quality of production and of the environment, led to job losses and to desertification in fragile areas."
"Every effort should be made to allow these alternative policies to succeed, but this is not the verdict handed down by our rapporteurs, in spite of the lack of information from the Commission."
"In fact, they note that the objectives have not been achieved."
"The decline in agricultural activity has often transformed agricultural areas into fallow land and wild forests, which are not valued and are extremely prone to fires, particularly in southern Europe."
"Difficult and mountainous regions continue to see their populations drift away."
"Areas of intensive production that threatens the environment have not been affected by the agri-environmental measures."
"This failure is the result of a CAP that put agricultural and forestry produce at the mercy of a market that tramples on prices and on human beings."
"Alternative policies do exist."
"Both the Cunha report, which was adopted by this House, and the basic law on French agriculture, call for a reform of the CAP that would use public funds to develop high-quality production that encourages land use, that respects the environment and that develops employment."
"In difficult mountain areas, prices and premiums should guarantee a reasonable revenue for small production structures."
"In all areas, premiums should have a fixed upper limit per operation in order to slow down the productivity race and to finance production contracts that work towards quality, employment and environmental protection."
"In the largest cultivated forest in the Union, in the south-west of France, as in Mediterranean forests, implementing new resin production techniques could bring people back to the now deserted areas."
"These are only three specific projects that reflect the spirit of a policy that would allow the financial resources committed by the Union to be used to meet the needs of our society."
"Madam President, thank you for the ten minutes."
"I already had one from my honourable colleague, so that makes eleven."
"I shall begin with my own three minutes."
"First point: We must remind ourselves clearly of the aim of these accompanying measures under Regulations 2078 and 2080."
"Mr Fischler, you were not yet the Commissioner at that time, and Austria was not yet in the EU."
"The aim was not to create an innovation programme, but rather, as the term 'accompanying measures' suggests, to establish mechanisms to accompany price reductions. These reductions had not been properly implemented and, as a result, certain farming activities outside the high-performance areas had been pushed to the brink of unprofitability."
"The intention was to compensate for this, which is why Regulation 2080 gives farmers the opportunity to afforest land that has been taken out of production."
"That was the aim behind these environmental measures."
"The fact that it has now developed into an innovation programme - and this is my second point, Mr Fischler - has nothing to do with its aims, but rather with the way it has been used by interested parties."
"Austria is a good example."
"The Austrians joined when the scheme was already operational and soon began to use the special production methods dictated by these environmental requirements as a cachet of quality for marketing purposes."
"The same applies to the organic farmers, some of whom are not even based in less-favoured areas, who have also joined this scheme and have been able to live with these rather small compensatory payments because the environmental tag has secured higher prices for their produce."
"It says here in Mr Iversen's report that the farmers and regional authorities in the more favoured areas have not otherwise availed themselves of this scheme, but that is precisely because these measures and the payments granted for them would not have compensated for the loss of earnings in these areas."
"So it was an accompanying programme, and the interested parties have turned it into an innovation programme."
"My third point concerns the funding issue."
"This scheme, of course, came under the heading of compulsory expenditure."
"I recently spoke to the Basque Agricultural Minister."
"He had visited Austria and was quite astonished to discover how much Austria obtains under this scheme."
"And so I asked him why the Basques had not been doing the same over the past few years."
"It was a notifiable Commission programme."
"Measures would have had to be paid for, because it was a compulsory scheme and was covered by the guarantee section of the EAGGF."
"In this way these funds could have been increased, we should have had a higher budget today, and there would have been no need for us to press for this increase."
"My final point relates to the future of this programme."
"Here I agree with you."
"This programme must be incorporated into the second pillar, and the way to do this is to take what has actually been done, to take this scheme that was launched as an environmental programme and turned into an innovation and marketing programme for special organic produce, and to combine it all with a structural programme for the integrated development of rural areas."
"So I am in agreement with you here."
"What I do not agree with, of course, is that you as a Commissioner are making the mistake of..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we should set this debate back in the general context of the reform of the CAP."
"Existing regulations on agri-environmental and afforestation measures should be made top-level priority in this area."
"In so far as it is true that in 1992 these regulations represented real attempts to better incorporate less production-orientated attitudes, it is also worrying to see today that they have had mixed, even negative, results."
"With Agenda 2000, a fundamental reform is necessary to improve food safety, particularly in meats."
"With animal nutrition lacking 70 % protein, the European Union is still running the risk of possible international embargoes."
"At the same time, a growing number of farmers are becoming involved in new high-quality production, land-based production, which shows more respect for the environment and which promotes regional markets and areas rather than producing vast quantities for export."
"There is also a need for some basic questions to be asked so that agricultural jobs, food safety, the quality of production and the protection of the rural environment remain at the heart of the reform of the CAP."
"We should no longer settle for accompanying measures, which are often no more than a scanty cover-up for an agricultural policy geared towards productivity, the constant reduction of prices, deregulation and the world market."
"The CAP must incorporate both economic and social considerations as well as aspects relating to the environment and rural land-use planning in the Union."
"Yes, Mr Iversen, you are indeed right to regret the fact that the Commission has decided to merely provide a summary, and not move on to a true assessment."
"The Commission did not wish to draw the operational conclusions that are necessary for the future."
"Agri-environmental measures could not be reduced to mere supplementary income for farmers."
"Making European agricultural producers sell their produce at a price that is below production costs does not create sustainable development."
"Rather than increase the number of environmental constraints imposed on farmers, let us include proportional aid in the specifications for payment conditions from the outset. Society would derive health, social and environmental advantages from a revitalised agricultural industry with, for example, special measures for mountainous regions, as Mr Santini suggests, or even for less-favoured areas."
"As for industrial-type operations, which often cause pollution, let us steer them towards the 'polluter pays' type systems, with environmental conditions and an upper limit for aid."
"Lastly, the same, rather worryingly, applies to the relative failure of forestry aid schemes in agriculture."
"As it was very unevenly applied depending on the country, there was no real effect in terms of rural development, even if it did achieve its goals in terms of land use and decreasing the amount of cultivated land."
"A simple European forestry strategy would be sufficient to encourage us to produce wood in Europe in a sustainable manner and to reject imports from tropical or boreal forests that often come from felled areas."
"We must, of course, fight for a substantial increase in financial resources, but we need the European Union to demonstrate a true political will in order to ensure the success and widespread adoption of these measures."
"Madam President, the promotion of more environmentally-friendly farming is not easy."
"It becomes even more difficult when profit margins are in question."
"It takes extra money to develop into new areas of production because of the cost of new buildings."
"So we have to be realistic and sensible in what we hope ultimately to achieve."
"It is also very clear that if there is an opt-out clause then many national governments will not make available the matching funding, with the result that the proposal is not put into effect."
"This is the real problem that will have to be remedied when we look at the reform package."
"We are in danger, I believe, of creating a very uneven playing field."
"We must ensure this does not happen within the European Union."
"Mr Santini's report - which I welcome - focuses on mountain areas."
"That is fine."
"I do not have any problem with that. But it strikes me that these mountain areas are very similar to the less-favoured areas."
"Parliament and its committees seem to be developing new ways of getting support into areas like the islands, peripheral regions and mountain areas now, but we could be in danger of spreading ourselves too thinly and not really helping them."
"Surely the general structures that are provided should be able to handle this."
"Action for the peripheral regions must be more broadly based."
"The future of the less-favoured areas is extremely bleak at the moment, with a serious drop in income."
"That is what we have to address and that is where we have to target our proposals in the future."
"Thank you."
"We shall now suspend the joint debate, which will be resumed after the votes."
"VOTES"
"Madam President, I have the honour to be the spokesman for the five groups which have drawn up this resolution, namely the Socialists, the Greens, the GUE and ARE Groups and, of course, the Liberals."
"I would like to inform you that these groups support only two amendments tabled by the PPE Group, Amendments Nos 5 and 8, and we will support the latter only on condition that this new text becomes paragraph 2."
"Madam President, I would like to make a reference to the Rules of Procedure pursuant to Rule 102, as the amendments relating to this resolution are not available in French."
"I am quite happy to say that I would willingly vote in favour of this resolution but I believe it is absolutely impossible to express an opinion when the amendments are not available in all languages."
"I waited for 10 minutes where the documents were being distributed."
"I was told there were no amendments left in French, that it was impossible to find any and I was advised to wait."
"I waited as long as I was supposed to and stopped waiting when I came into this sitting."
"Therefore, we do not have the amendments available in one of the languages in use in the European Union."
"Madam President, together with Mr Dupuis and others, I signed a number of amendments calling for action to be taken against numerous other dictators and ex-dictators."
"I cannot find any of these amendments in our documentation, and now I hear that the administration has declared them inadmissible, as it were."
"Let me ask you this: since when has the administration had the power to decide which dictators and ex-dictators we may and may not pursue?"
"You are labouring under a misapprehension, Mr Posselt."
"The administration does not decide whether or not an amendment is admissible, but the President himself."
"In this context, we are dealing only with the arrest of General Pinochet, and nothing else."
"Consequently, all the amendments which go beyond that subject are inadmissible."
"The authors have also been informed of this in writing, to the best of my belief."
"Madam President, I never questioned the existence of a French version of the amendments."
"I simply said that this version was not available."
"But thanks to the goodwill of one of our colleagues who has now become an usher as well, I received the document in French after I had taken the floor."
"I am delighted by this."
"But, besides all this, I question the reasons why we are deciding, and I wonder on what authority we are deciding, that the amendments relating to certain dictators are admissible, whereas amendments relating to other dictators are not."
"(Applause)"
"You may table as many motions for resolutions as you wish, but this time we are dealing only with a single person, and nothing else."
"Madam President, I accept Mr Bertens' proposal but, when we vote on this text, I would like to table an oral amendment, which I am sure will be accepted by the Socialist Group and, therefore, I would ask you to allow me to state it now."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 8"
"Madam President, when we make mention here of our commitment to the principle of universal justice and, consequently, call on the competent authorities to interpret it in accordance with the principles of the Treaty on European Union, I would like to add after 'competent authorities' the words 'in particular those of Spain and the United Kingdom', which are the authorities involved in this matter."
"I am sure that the Socialist Group will understand, since it is entirely logical, that both the Spanish judicial and government authorities - the latter having the authority to convey the judges' request - and the British authorities - which have the authority to grant extradition - are those involved in this case and, consequently, will accept this obvious reference to them."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"That was recital G. We asked for a separate vote on each part."
"May I question Mr Chichester on one point? It may be that something has been mistranslated here, but the German version says that the radioactive waste which is currently produced is principally medical waste."
"That, of course, is entirely wrong from a factual and a technical point of view."
"If it has been mistranslated, fair enough, but if not, we shall naturally have to delete the reference to 'principally medical waste', because that is not true; it is nonsense, as everyone knows!"
"Madam President, this was an amendment which was originally introduced by the Green Group at the committee stage so I do not know what they are on about now."
"Surely, we have not quite reached the vote."
"We are having a separate vote on the three parts of Consideration G, so why do we not just vote?"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, we are very pleased with the substance of this report, in which Mr Chichester gives a realistic and objective description and assessment of the problem."
"We were therefore happy to vote for the resolution."
"The decommissioning of nuclear power stations is going to become an increasingly important industry in the future."
"The report rightly stresses the need to protect public health through prevention in all the activities associated with decommissioning."
"Because of the huge range of differences inside and outside the Union, it is not feasible to harmonise decommissioning, and the responsibility therefore falls to the Member States and the power station operators."
"It is up to them to choose whether to go for direct, complete dismantling or staged decommissioning, and the cost of decommissioning should, of course, be included in the cost of the electricity produced."
"Exchanges of knowledge and experience should be encouraged, as should research, education and information activities."
"Giving the general public clear information on why and how nuclear power stations are decommissioned also gives them greater insight into the problems associated with decommissioning and the storage of nuclear waste."
"However, there is one small criticism we would make about recital N: requiring social acceptance of decommissioning and the storage of nuclear waste as a condition for the future development of nuclear energy seems a little excessive, which is why we voted against it."
"According to its title, this report should be dealing with decommissioning nuclear power stations, but it looks more like a defence of nuclear energy."
"I find that unacceptable."
"Nuclear power is not safe and should therefore be abandoned."
"The report ought to be focusing more on how decommissioning is to be organised and, fundamentally, on the technical measures required to ensure that it happens safely from the radiation point of view."
"I am sorry that the majority of the House felt unable to support the important amendments tabled by the Green Group."
"Several EU Member States, including Sweden and Germany, have decided to begin decommissioning, but this is not mentioned in the text."
"I therefore voted against the whole report."
"Representing a constituency in a region which has for many years played a leading role in the civil use of nuclear energy, I welcome the initiative of Mr Chichester in producing this report on the future of decommissioning nuclear plants."
"Nuclear energy inspires both strong support and strong criticism."
"Here perhaps is a nuclear issue - how to retire nuclear plants safely as they reach the end of their useful life - which can unite us all!"
"I acknowledge the skills of nuclear energy workers such as the many people in the north-west of England who work in this sector and help the modern economy to function."
"I have faith in their ability to manage the decommissioning of old plants in the future, just as they have risen to the challenge of reprocessing spent fuel in the past."
"I back the principle of this report that such work is best left to national authorities and the industry's expertise rather than the EU."
"However, the report is also right to ask that, as in research, where the EU can play a useful role in decommissioning, its work should as a matter of course include the many Central and Eastern European nations whose communist-built nuclear plants need help to decommission safely."
"That concludes voting time."
"Agricultural production and the environment -Forestry measures - Mountain areas (continued)"
"We shall now continue with the joint debate that was interrupted earlier."
"Madam President, in the context of agriculture and the environmental impact in different terrain, I have to say that all the arguments put by Mr Santini apply equally to less-favoured areas."
"Rural depopulation is a problem, particularly in my country of Wales."
"Young people - parents - are leaving the rural areas for the towns and their place is being taken by retired people or those who use rural areas as dormitories while their economic activity takes place in the town."
"This has disastrous effects."
"The economic vitality of youth is replaced by the recreation of the elderly."
"Schools and shops close and bus routes close down."
"We have to devise new methods to keep young people in rural areas."
"We have to ensure affordable public services in all these rural areas."
"One way we can help is to find better methods of compensating rural inhabitants for the provision of environmental services."
"The Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances should be used to compensate for natural handicaps and not to achieve environmental goals."
"Separate schemes to encourage intensive farming, like Tircymen in Wales, should be funded through separate agri-environmental schemes."
"The identities of people in sparsely-populated areas must also be respected."
"We must not think of rural areas as the playground of visitors from the towns."
"We want the economic benefits of tourism, but we need investment in bread-winner jobs as well."
"We must always beware of the environmental impact of all development."
"But we must also evaluate the economic impact of all our environmental considerations."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I speak from experience when I talk about this programme, because we have been working with this Regulation 2078 scheme on my farm since 1993."
"So what I tell you here is drawn from practice, and I should also like to deal with a number of areas in which we could perhaps make improvements."
"In my own federal state of Baden-Württemberg, this programme has gained wide acceptance, but the level of regional cofinancing is very high at 50 %."
"Our regional government is groaning under this burden."
"It also maintains, and I can only agree, Mr Fischler, that it has far too little say in the scheme."
"Because it bears half the cost and is responsible for inspecting the scheme, it should have a greater say."
"I certainly wish to endorse that view."
"This is an opportunity to put subsidiarity into practice."
"The local authorities used to have more scope to decide how to implement the programme."
"The Commission, however, is always imposing new requirements and more red tape, and in particular its new authorisation policy is tending to focus far more sharply on nature conservation and less sharply on the management of poor farmland."
"Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with me when I say that the Black Forest and our central German upland farms with their typically high proportion of grassland should be preserved and should not be altered."
"You will also agree with me when I say that extensive farming is far cheaper than the management of industrial land."
"That is why we should support it."
"Farmers participating in the scheme must commit themselves for five years."
"Apart from anything else, this will provide a sound planning basis."
"In our part of the world, however, there are farmers who have a great many leased fields and have no influence over the fluctuation of these leased fields."
"That is why there should be some scope for local adjustments to improve the effectiveness of the scheme."
"The farmers in our region fulfil certain prior conditions, which nobody has mentioned."
"They refrain from second cuts and from late fertilising, because these restraints really protect the countryside and safeguard groundwater."
"Above all, we forego maximum yields, and we hoe our maize."
"That costs more, and it means that we dispense with plant protection."
"That is what I really call environmentally friendly farming, but it is not taken to extremes."
"Let me mention four more points."
"Regulation No 2078/92 has proved its worth."
"Greater regional flexibility should lead to wider acceptance of the scheme, and its benefits must be recognisable at the local level."
"Secondly, the Commission's restrictive authorisation practice tends to neglect the important role of extensive farming as a means of caring for and preserving the agricultural landscape."
"Thirdly, in some areas of farming, more flexible rules of application should be devised, with a view to promoting regional adaptations."
"Agri-environmental measures should not exclude statutory environmental requirements."
"Fourthly - and this is very important, Commissioner - the strict limitation of grant income to 20 % of total earnings, as imposed by Regulation No 746/96, reduces the level of acceptance of some measures."
"Greater flexibility would therefore be welcomed."
"Thank you very much, Madam President, for your indulgence; I did continue beyond my allotted time, but I just know so much about this matter and want to impart that knowledge, at least to the Commissioner!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is absolutely vital to discuss the Commission's report on forestry measures promoted as an alternative use of agricultural land, before taking a decision on the proposal for a significant increase in afforestation aid as part of rural development policy under Agenda 2000."
"The rapporteur, Jyrki Otila, is absolutely right when he says that the Commission has failed to address the essential question of whether the objective of reducing agricultural production has been achieved with the enormous amounts of aid spent."
"At the end of the day, what we require is a comprehensive, detailed report on the cost-benefit ratio of the afforestation programme, the actual amount of money spent and how it was allocated, and giving an in-depth survey of the impact on the environment."
"The vague and weak aspects of the scheme have to be put right before aid policy is extended in any way."
"I genuinely hope that the Commission will now give a clearer response to the questions posed than it did, for example, in the reply I received a couple of weeks ago to a written question of mine on the evaluation of forestry aid."
"In the explanatory statement of his report the rapporteur refers many times to Parliament's proposal on forestry strategy."
"Parliament's proposal emphasises that forestry must continue to operate according to market forces, without aid that would distort competition, and primarily under State guidance."
"The added value of the role of the EU in forestry policy has to be strictly limited to action that supports the multi-functional use of forests and economic exploitation in accordance with sustainable development."
"For example, there could be support for the certification of European holdings engaged in forestry that promote the use of wood, as an alternative to the FSC scheme, which strives for monopoly status."
"Madam President, the Community has no common forestry policy, not only because none is mentioned either in the founding Treaties nor in their later revised versions, but also because practical experience over 30 years proves as much. The Community - its institutional bodies - always comes up with improvised and random measures, trying to patch up the deficiencies."
"In my view this Community policy on forests and forestry is responsible for the destruction of our forests."
"Tens of thousands of hectares are destroyed every year throughout the European Union, especially in southern areas and more disastrously still in Greece."
"The Otila report, which attempts to address the issue, adopts a similar view, Madam President, but negatively so because it says that reforestation is an alternative use for agricultural land. In other words, reforestation should spread to areas used for growing crops."
"This is sheer hypocrisy because thousands of hectares are still awaiting reforestation in vain, and now we want reforestation in areas where the land can be cultivated!"
"Unless we decide to adopt an organised forestry policy with the necessary resources for the research, science and technology needed to prevent and combat fires, what we are debating today is only so much hot air and there will be very painful economic, social and ecological disasters."
"Disasters which may prove to be totally overwhelming."
"Thank you, Mr Santini, for a very good report."
"Mountains cover one quarter of the EU's surface area."
"Soil quality is poor in these areas, and very few people live there."
"In Sweden, the figure is a mere five inhabitants per square kilometre. Holdings are small, with a mixture of farming and forestry activities to make ends meet."
"Often, people farm only part-time, because they cannot earn a living from the land alone. The migration rate away from such regions is high."
"There are many elderly people, and the young move away to escape the tough living conditions."
"Not to mention the climate - winter lasts seven months in Scandinavia; it is dark for four months of the year, and vegetation survives a bare 160 days."
"Yet these environments are unique, with rich biological diversity."
"The agriculture that does exist is environmentally friendly, the natural world is full of variety, there is a strong culture and much else besides."
"We have to acknowledge that mountain farmers cannot compete with those in flatter places."
"Specially designed and flexible measures are required, and account needs to be taken of the real circumstances in mountainous districts, which are so different from other areas in which agriculture is practised."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the promotion of farming methods which are not harmful to the environment, nature or the countryside deserves serious attention."
"The Union's agri-environmental measures can provide an incentive here."
"Agreements had been concluded with 17 % of the Member States' holdings by halfway through the 1997 budget year, and the scheme has grown into a major policy field within the CAP."
"The Commission report indicates that the scheme is facing a number of teething problems."
"Spending has been far less than estimated, partly because the programmes started late, and a number of Member States are making little, if any, use of the scheme, which is worrying."
"We need to analyse the reasons for this, and in particular to find out whether the fact that the Member States themselves also have to provide funding has anything to do with it."
"I feel it is important to find out about this, especially in view of the possibility currently being mooted of introducing cofinancing for income support as well."
"The Commission report unfortunately does not analyse the beneficial effects of the agri-environmental measures on the environment and the countryside."
"If, as the rapporteur suspects, agricultural activities are being subsidised which should not be receiving subsidies, then the scheme needs to be reviewed."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to produce a detailed evaluation report as soon as possible, and certainly before any final decision is taken on a new programme."
"The agrienvironmental subsidies must not be allowed to become a form of disguised income support, and I feel it is extremely important here to clarify the requirements in the regulation and to monitor compliance more closely."
"A report on the effects of the agri-environmental measures is also needed for the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"The Union must be able to prove that the subsidies bring advantages for the environment, so that they can stay in the 'green box'."
"So there is every reason to ensure that the fullest possible use is made of these subsidies in restoring the environment and the countryside."
"Madam President, it is probably appropriate today that we have a group of visitors in the gallery from the lovely country of Scotland, which is our key forestry area in the United Kingdom."
"I would just like to put a tiny question mark against Mr Otila's report, and that is that we always take it for granted that we want more trees."
"I have trees in my garden, I have planted trees in my garden and I like to see trees when I am driving around."
"I would like to ask the simple question: are we really certain that we will need those trees in the future for the production of wood?"
"It is quite obvious in my constituency of Shropshire and Herefordshire that, at the moment, our wood industry is under tremendous pressure."
"In fact some people responsible for saw mills say that it is the worst situation they have experienced in 45 years in the industry."
"The market for British wood - and only a tiny part of the British market is actually supplied from within the UK - has actually contracted by some 25 %."
"In southern England eight saw mills have closed in the last three months."
"There is real concern for the future of our wood industry."
"It seems that part of the problem arises as a result of the raising of the Iron Curtain."
"It seems that the former Soviet Union is dumping wood at ridiculously low prices simply to get foreign exchange."
"I would like to say yes, by all means let us plant more trees but let us at least have some concrete idea as to whether in the future there will be a market for the wood produced."
"At some point in the future it might be necessary to place a moratorium on trees under this scheme being put on to the market so that we do not in the future damage the wood industry."
"Perhaps we need an import levy from non-EC countries to ensure that we protect our own market."
"I am concerned that we are following this path and are in danger of overproducing, and I would certainly like to hear the Commissioner's response to that point."
"This might be the very first time that anybody has stood up and questioned whether we should plant more trees."
"In the light of current circumstances, faced by at least the British wood industry and wood industries in other parts of the EU, it is a question we need to ask."
"Madam President, I want to welcome all three reports and say that these schemes are all complementary to the overall goals of agricultural policy."
"The environmental scheme serves the purpose - as I believe it should - of providing supplementary income in regions where incomes are so low people would move out in greater numbers if that scheme did not exist."
"It serves a purpose in relation to tourism, in helping to make the countryside more attractive, and from my experience of the scheme, it is certainly beginning to take effect."
"It was slow to start, as Mr Iverson pointed out, at any rate in Ireland, but this was because we did not have enough training or experience and we needed to get people who could advise farmers."
"The scheme has taken off and is beginning to have a remarkable effect on the countryside."
"It also has an effect on farm income."
"I am not one of those people who believe that we ought to direct our resources towards producing organic food."
"I do not believe that organic food is automatically healthier and better than food produced in more intensive situations."
"I do not believe that it necessarily improves the general environment to reduce everything to the organic levels that we had in the past."
"I remember the time when nearly all farming was organic."
"It was not a pleasant world - there were more hungry people around then than there are today."
"If, for instance, you plough a hectare of land to get four tonnes of wheat, then that is more environmentally-friendly than if you plough four hectares of land to get four tonnes of wheat."
"We should not automatically assume that, because we use more energy, use tractors and have more erosion in intensive agriculture, it is less environmentally-friendly."
"If you extrapolate from the Dutch example, you only need an area the size of France, Holland and Belgium to feed all the people of Europe and therefore you have all the rest of Europe for environmental purposes."
"I am not suggesting it should be done that way, but it is not necessarily dangerous or bad for the environment."
"As regards afforestation, some aspects of afforestation are popular with rural dwellers."
"In Ireland we lamented the loss of our forests 200 years ago, and today farmers resist afforestation as some sort of evil."
"Nevertheless the forestry scheme that has been introduced by the Commission has encouraged forestry in the farming sector and has improved - and will continue to improve - the environment, as well as helping to reduce surpluses in all parts of the Community."
"Madam President, the package of three agri-environmental reports under discussion is an extremely interesting one."
"I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their thoroughness."
"For now, I only want to refer to Mr Otila's report on forests and woodland."
"The word 'forest' carries with it different images in different parts of the European Union."
"In Finland and Sweden the forest is the normal natural environment."
"Cultivated fields just appear as odd patches in the midst of the forest."
"The forest is also a very valuable renewable resource."
"Rural regions that remain uncultivated become afforested naturally, which is also the case with areas of woodland that have been cut down or burnt."
"In central Europe the forests are mainly recreation areas and parks, where people can interact with the countryside."
"The forests of the Mediterranean region are a key factor in protecting the landscape and nature in general."
"Forests help prevent soil erosion, they make for more evenly occurring precipitation and regulate its effect, and they improve the climate."
"For these reasons, forest maintenance varies from country to country."
"It is influenced by ecological, social and economical factors, which is also why forestry policy differs from country to country."
"The basic aims, philosophy and methods cannot be the same, so forestry policy cannot be harmonised, because different conditions call for different policies."
"This may also be the main reason why the Treaty of Rome does not bring forestry policy under the jurisdiction of the EU."
"For all these reasons I cannot agree with paragraph 8 of Mr Otila's report, which advocates efforts to harmonise national forestry policies, but I support his Amendment No 3 in the same way as I support his other amendments."
"Joint development of the forestry sector must be promoted, but if it were part of Community policy the sector would be subject to much bureaucracy and would be a shambles as far as funding is concerned."
"Madam President, I have read Mr Otila's report and what he says in it has made me very worried."
"My first concern is that this regulation seems to enjoy varying and rather disappointing degrees of success in different countries, as I think is only natural given that it was designed to reduce agricultural production and to use the development of forests as a vehicle for doing so."
"In other words, it was the main vehicle for increasing the incomes of certain farmers."
"In that sense, I think that its success was limited from the start so far as forests and their development in the European Union are concerned."
"My second point is that it is a pity the European Union does not have a forestry policy and unfortunately, in the absence of an EU policy, there are countries such as Greece whose forests are being devastated and which also have no forestry policy."
"The last speaker said that situations vary."
"Of course they do."
"But, for example, the EU has a policy on islands."
"The United Kingdom is an island, Ireland is an island, and so is my small island in the Aegean."
"This does not mean that the same policy will apply to all islands."
"And it is a serious omission, especially when Mediterranean forests are now being destroyed and the environment of half of Europe is being degraded, with consequences for tourism, civilisation, and the development of Europe itself."
"In that sense, I cannot agree with Mr Otila's report, and in particular paragraph 8 in which he seems to assume that there will not be a forestry policy in the European Union."
"On the contrary, I believe we ought to try to include the issue of forests in the Treaties."
"That, of course, does not mean that the same measures would be adopted in Finland and in Greece!"
"Madam President, I have a few points about the accompanying measures designed to promote environmental protection and conservation."
"The Member States are making increasing use of these types of measures, which pay farmers for protecting nature and the environment by using extensive farming methods in particular."
"Austria, Finland and Sweden are all countries making above average use of them, and their attention must clearly have been drawn to them during the accession negotiations."
"An important condition for using this form of Community aid is that considerable national cofinancing also has to be provided."
"Not all countries are equally prepared to do this, which explains why the take-up of EU funding available also varies."
"This is actually a good example of an area of shared political and financial responsibility between the EU and the Member States within the CAP."
"The aid benefits farmers making an extra effort to help the environment and nature, but it is also a matter of agricultural policy in that it is also about the fairly widespread use of extensive farming methods."
"We could well imagine that, if the support we are discussing today is maintained, the idea of sharing political and financial responsibility between the EU and the Member States could also apply to some of the income support provided for under the 1992 price support reductions and subsequently under Agenda 2000."
"In that case, the environmental criteria would not need to focus so much on extensive farming, but would cover all farms applying what we now call good agricultural practices."
"Social criteria could also be added."
"This is a lesson we can learn from Regulation 2078: it is better to have a custom-built system of cofinancing subject to national environmental and social desirability criteria than to have a uniform system of income support allocated centrally by Brussels alone."
"Actually, even Regulation 2078 seems to have been inspired not just by environmental criteria, but by social necessity too."
"Such an approach will also automatically qualify these sorts of measures for the WTO green box."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what is sadly lacking in European policy is the ability to confront the problems faced by citizens living in a rural environment, and mountain regions are part of this environment."
"Amongst other things, it does of course cost a great deal of money to maintain a farming population in these difficult areas."
"But there is also a high price to pay for the exodus of these citizens, who leave their poorer regions to move to towns and their suburbs, where they find very few jobs."
"The more poor people there are in the towns and their suburbs - often called shanty towns - the more insecurity there is and the more police officers or security guards are employed, and this also comes at a high price."
"The decline of agriculture in mountainous regions has also led to an increase in the number of avalanches, particularly in northern areas."
"And look at the human tragedy this entails: every year, avalanches claim many victims."
"Neglecting pasture land and not maintaining undergrowth increase the risk of forest fires. These fires are causing more and more damage and are becoming more and more frequent, mainly in southern Europe."
"Imagine how much all this must cost."
"We should pay shepherds for services to the environment, we should pay them in order to save a considerable amount of money."
"We must also consider farming forest areas with a view to producing alternative green energy sources par excellence ."
"Research must also be carried out on how to obtain rapid growth species, such as eucalyptus, and on developing power stations for such plant matter, or on producing methane, which could be extracted to be used for other thermal power stations."
"And perhaps, rather than saving money with no positive outcome, the general rule should be to better organise the integration of less-favoured areas into the economic development area by making considerable financial efforts, as indeed you do so well in Austria, Commissioner."
"What is more, nowadays, given the amazing developments in communication and exchange technology, it would be possible to encourage high-quality job creation in these areas, through remote working, for example. And why not send some of the staff of the Commission's various Directorates-General to these troubled areas, where they can do routine office work?"
"Commissioner, I am also counting on you and on your collective intelligence to achieve this and so allow the rural world in general, and less-favoured areas in particular, to be transformed from the dead weights they were to a catalyst for the harmonious development of all our peoples, throughout Europe."
"Madam President, I want to say something briefly about the reports by Mr Iversen and Mr Otila."
"It is notable that although both argue for alternative agricultural activity, both rapporteurs conclude that there has been no evaluation by the Commission."
"That is unfortunate because it is difficult to promote them as measures before we have some sort of evaluation."
"As far as environmentally-friendly farming is concerned, I certainly would support it. However, I suspect that part of the problem is that it is quite expensive to set up."
"Maybe the Commission should look at the levels of grant aid."
"As regards forestry, I have always supported it."
"The reason I have supported it is that I saw it as an opportunity to supplement the incomes of farmers, especially those with poor land."
"But one must ask the question if that was the intention, are they the ones currently benefiting?"
"It seems to me that a number of the forestry schemes that operate in Ireland most of the benefits go to speculators, particularly from outside the country."
"I question whether that is a sensible direction for forestry policy."
"I would much prefer that the income went to farmers themselves."
"There are also some serious questions relating to planning because some of the afforestation is also unsightly."
"Perhaps that is something that our local authorities should look at: whether or not forestry schemes should require planning approval."
"Those are the comments I wanted to make regarding those two reports."
"I urge the Commission to carry out an evaluation in these two areas to see if there is more potential in them as initiatives in the field of agricultural activity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of simplicity, I shall deal with each of the three reports in turn, in other words beginning with the Iversen report, moving on in the second part of my remarks to deal with the Otila report, and finally stating our position on the Santini report."
"The Iversen report testifies on the one hand to a thorough understanding of the complex issues involved."
"On the other hand, though, it is also a highly critical report, and its criticism is levelled both at the Member States' authorities which produce and implement the programmes and at the Commission."
"The main focus of the report is certainly on the question of evaluation."
"That is also the principal concern of the Commission itself."
"Before I deal with these matters in detail, I should like to draw your attention to some basic facts of agri-environmental policy which are also recognised and confirmed in the Iversen report."
"First of all, the main principle underlying our policy is that we should pay the farmers for their environmental contributions, not in the form of so-called income-support grants but as remuneration for the work they do, as reimbursement of their increased expenditure and as compensation for loss of income."
"Secondly, because the programme has been monitored, we now have concrete evidence that successes have undoubtedly been achieved through our environmental measures in cutting back on the quantities of nutrients introduced into the soil and in protecting the natural world."
"These successes are acknowledged in the report too."
"Thirdly, further improvements are needed in the format and administration of the programmes."
"Fourthly, the various rural development measures and the market measures contained in the common agricultural policy must be more effectively integrated and coordinated in general terms, just as we have envisaged in our Agenda 2000 proposals."
"To these central points enumerated in the report I should like to add a few more. A fifth point would be that the ecology of the European countryside is determined to a great extent by agriculture and forestry."
"New research findings show that biodiversity and the landscape which has developed over centuries can only be preserved with the aid of appropriate systems of land and forestry management."
"Point number six: attitudes in European society, including farmers' attitudes, will have to change."
"In principle, our strategy for the future is based on two considerations."
"The first of these is that farmers must attain a certain minimum standard in order to qualify for compensatory payments."
"This is taken for granted in any industry, and is no more than the population expects."
"In my view, the minimum standard must be good farming practice."
"The other consideration is that, if farmers go beyond this minimum standard and do more to improve the environment, society must compensate them for the loss of earnings or additional expenses this entails."
"In a world that is increasingly ruled by competition, farmers must necessarily minimise their costs."
"This could mean that the contributions to the protection of the environment which they used to provide virtually free of charge as part of normal farming routine will no longer be possible in future."
"That is why we need to provide remuneration for agri-environmental measures."
"Many farmers are prepared to enter into a contract to provide these protective measures."
"But the fact is that they will only do so if they are adequately recompensed."
"Let me now deal with the question of evaluation to which I referred."
"I welcome Parliament's interest in this matter, because that really does help us to impress our positions more forcefully on national and regional authorities."
"The Commission has already taken important measures with regard to the evaluation of agri-environmental schemes."
"We have been vigorously urging the national and regional authorities to have such evaluations carried out as a first step."
"We have also provided these authorities with appropriate guidelines."
"And in addition, we have included in the implementing regulation a provision which unequivocally lays down the Member States' obligations in the field of evaluation."
"Lastly, we have been working continuously on evaluation-related questions by investing research funds under the PHARE programme and by commissioning other studies."
"Of course I understand the sometimes critical stance of the national and regional authorities."
"Most of the programmes they are implementing were not launched until 1995 or 1996, and it is only logical that a certain time has to elapse before measurable results actually start to emerge."
"Moreover, it must be admitted that environmental protection is a complex business and that the monitoring of biodiversity and the monitoring or recording of nutrient input, for example, are physically and technically difficult tasks."
"Nevertheless, we have received no fewer than 158 evaluation reports from the Member States, although 53 of these were only completed this year or are only available in draft form for the time being."
"We therefore expect another large batch of reports in the coming year."
"As far as the findings of these reports are concerned, I can well understand why Parliament is becoming impatient as it awaits the results of these important measures."
"However, I can inform you today that this additional report will be completed within the next few days and will then be transmitted as quickly as possible to the chairmen of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr Funk indicated that he wanted the Member States or regional administrations to have a greater say."
"I must point out to you, Mr Funk, that responsibility for drawing up these programmes already lies with the Member States and regions."
"It is in fact the Commission which merely has a say here, while the actual programming is done by the regions."
"That is how it is, Mr Funk!"
"This brings me to the second part of my remarks, which focuses on the Otila report."
"This report contains numerous relevant points, some of which have already been incorporated into the Commission proposals for Agenda 2000."
"In its proposal for a new regulation on rural development, the Commission has considered a number of amendments to the aid regime which correspond to some of the conclusions set out in the Otila report."
"In particular, the Commission proposes an end to the distinction between full-time and part-time farmers that is made in the present regulation, since this differentiation has frequently obstructed the successful application of the aid regime."
"The Commission also proposes that the implementation of the measures in the Member States should cease to be compulsory and become optional."
"However, the Commission cannot endorse all the conclusions of the parliamentary report."
"We believe that caution should be exercised in formulating the final conclusions regarding the application of Regulation 2080."
"As we argued in our report, afforestation of farmland is a lengthy process."
"It is almost certainly too early to judge after so few years how the regulation is working and, in particular, the extent to which it is helping to reduce agricultural production and improve forestry resources."
"May I also take this opportunity to state that timber supplies in the European Union are not diminishing but are increasing from year to year."
"So no one need fear that our forestry stocks are being depleted. We take the view that the farmland afforestation schemes will contribute to rural development in the long run by promoting diversified employment opportunities, a dynamic land-use strategy and proper conservation of the rural landscape."
"Moreover, we firmly believe that this regime will have a beneficial impact on the environment."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament on the need to assess the implementation of Regulation 2080."
"I can also assure you that we shall go all out to complete this task and to submit the results to Parliament."
"To do this, however, we must first have reliable and representative data."
"With regard to the forestry strategy of the Community in general, and in particular the question whether forestry activities should be governed by Community legislation, the Commission will also shortly reach a decision on such a forestry strategy, which will likewise be communicated to Parliament."
"Without seeking to anticipate the view of the Commission, let me say now that I personally am not in favour of forestry policy becoming a Community responsibility."
"And so to part three, on Mr Santini's report."
"I believe Mr Santini has addressed a very important subject, and I should like to express my sincere thanks to him and to all the other rapporteurs."
"It is now over 20 years since the subject of mining and mountain regions was first addressed in the Communities, and back then a framework was created for less-favoured areas."
"Mountainous areas were given an especially prominent position within that framework."
"The difficult conditions in which farmers work in mountain regions also warrant special consideration in the common agricultural policy."
"However, we must not overlook the fact that there are other regions which have to struggle with specific problems, such as Nordic regions, dry areas and places with various other types of natural disadvantage."
"We must not therefore make the mistake of examining the needs and wishes of farmers in mountain areas in isolation, without reference to all the other less-favoured areas."
"This is clearly reflected in the wish expressed by individual Members that this report should be extended to arid and semi-arid or Arctic zones."
"Moreover, an excessively individualised approach to the features of any specific type of rural area would run counter to the need to simplify our policy."
"Allow me, in response to this report, to outline to you the way in which we intend to approach the problems of mountain areas in Agenda 2000 and the solutions we are offering."
"We want to introduce greater degrees of flexibility and subsidiarity into rural development policies so that the Member States will be better able to achieve their objectives in terms of supporting rural areas."
"In my opinion, the two principles underlying this approach open up interesting prospects for our mountain areas, because in the future it will be possible, by combining the existing subprogrammes and measures into a single programme, to set clear priorities in order to select from the many options those which guarantee the most fruitful development."
"In this way the whole can become greater than the sum of its parts, and the specific needs of mountainous areas can be more effectively addressed."
"Restructuring and topping up the compensatory allowance also create greater scope to reward specific contributions made by the farmers living in the less-favoured areas."
"The place of mountain areas in the new provisions on rural development is therefore secure."
"Madam President, Mr Fischler has said nothing about the question of funding."
"We have tabled an amendment which states that cofinancing by Member States should be fixed at 25 %, with a 75 % input from the EU; similarly, we have this discussion about the other premiums, the compensatory premiums, which have always been paid in full, as you know."
"It seems to me that the political assessment of these measures we are discussing here is often dependent on this figure of 50 %, and we should agree here on a lower national and regional cofinancing rate, so that the programmes will actually be accepted."
"Madam President, may I begin by reminding the House in quite general terms that environmental policy and environmental measures in the agricultural sector cannot be a matter for the Community alone, but must also be a concern of the Member States and regions."
"After all, these regions are where the people of Europe live."
"With regard to cofinancing, then, let me point out that we already have 75 % Community funding in Objective 1 areas and 50 % in the other areas."
"Since we are seeking to extend these measures, and since I also have the impression that the Member States are availing themselves of these schemes more and more frequently, we have laid down in the Agenda 2000 proposals, under which these environmental measures would be integrated into the overall rural development programme, that the cofinancing of environmental measures should at all events remain at 50 %, because in other situations, for example development aid for the less-favoured areas or mountain regions of many countries, the Community cofinancing rates fall considerably short of the 50 % mark."
"In that respect, environmental measures outside the Objective 1 areas will certainly attract a higher cofinancing rate in future than other rural development measures."
"Thank you, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"EAGGF: 26th financial report"
"The next item is the report (A4-0298/98) by Mr Rehder, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the twenty-sixth financial report concerning the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section (1996 financial year) (COM(97)0589 - C4-0112/98)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while it is certainly true that anyone reading this rather cryptic title will be taken aback, the report before the House is considerably more interesting than the title would suggest."
"This report was drawn up because the European Parliament, representing the taxpayers of Europe, has the right and the duty to carry out exhaustive checks on the management of Union finances."
"And the precept of good housekeeping - a virtue in men and women - enjoins us to ensure that taxpayers' money is being used economically and that any misuse of funds is identified and penalised - to ensure, in short, that something is done here to stop such abuses."
"This agricultural budget attracts particular public interest because it accounts for almost half of the entire EU budget and because, sadly, sufficient care has not always been taken in the past to comply with this housekeeping principle of economical and proper use of tax revenues."
"We know that not only the Court of Auditors of the European Union but also the national audit offices of the Member States apply very stringent criteria."
"For all their necessary rigour, glaring errors do still occur."
"Some of the objections and defects undoubtedly result from the impenetrable application jungle, which causes many applicants to make unintentional mistakes."
"There, now, is a task for you, Commissioner - to cut a swathe through this forest of bureaucracy; this would be one type of deforestation that every environmentalist would support."
"We could then plant freeflowering vegetation there which would create its own natural environment and would not have permanent links with the waste-paper bin."
"Please have pity on the people who have not been trained to fill in forms but are entitled to aid by virtue of their farming activities."
"A major part of these shortcomings, however, is down to subsidy fraud and often - and we sometimes forget this here in our parliamentary discussions - to a lack of willingness on the part of the Member States to prosecute and, if necessary, punish those who misappropriate EU funds with quite the same vigour as they apply to breaches of national law - despite the fact that the European Union even makes funds available to the Member States for verification purposes."
"This is an utterly untenable situation."
"It is also intolerable, as the European Court of Auditors noted, that a mere fraction of wrongfully received support funds is actually reclaimed, thanks to the continuing inadequacy of the statutory instruments available."
"If this were to occur in the average small municipality, in the treasury of a county town or in any other town hall or city chambers, the mayor or members of the administration would face suspension from office in countries where the law so provides."
"In this context it would be advisable, if only for educational reasons, to prescribe cofinancing in future in the realm of the EAGGF."
"I say 'educational reasons' because it would be a means of bringing home more clearly to the Member States that it is basically their own money or the money of their own citizens and taxpayers that is being managed so casually and - I have to be blunt - often sloppily too."
"Another point which merits criticism is that a significant proportion of allocated budgetary funds are still not being used."
"When we examine this report, we see that in the reporting period, the year 1996, this sum only amounted to ECU 1.3 billion. That, however, was a result of the BSE crisis, which created a demand for considerable extra resources; in 1995 a total of ECU 3.5 billion went unused."
"To the taxpayer, that is an enormous amount of money."
"And that brings me back to forestry policy, where we could surely have put those funds to far better use in Germany over the past eight years."
"These vast surpluses show that the contingency planning which is necessary in every political domain has been overdone in this case."
"The present legal position - and this is the crux of the problem with this whole business - is that these funds have to be returned to the Member States."
"For many Member States, including my own, the agricultural budget has developed into a sort of cash box which offers governments an annual opportunity to plug revenue gaps which their own policies have created and to convey the impression that national fiscal policy can more or less ensure survival."
"But the agricultural budget is not a cash box; it is the principal means of preserving the rural areas of Europe for those who inhabit them and for everyone else."
"Every penny is needed for that task, because we must also try to reverse the sins of the past."
"For that reason, I have proposed in the report that an annual reserve of ECU 1 billion should be created from the agricultural budget."
"If there is a surplus at the end of the year, this reserve should be used to improve the rural infrastructure in general and above all to fight unemployment, which naturally exists in rural areas too."
"Mr Mulder took up this idea and, being a experienced budget specialist, perfected it."
"Thank you, Mr Mulder."
"This demonstrates that such joint efforts across the party-political divide are effective, and that we can achieve progress if our minds and our work are not dominated by these divisions."
"The European Parliament is far more agreeable in that respect than is sometimes the case, unfortunately, in other parliaments."
"On the downside, however, there are other Members of this House who have been fighting tooth and nail - unsuccessfully, thank goodness - to prevent any further public identification of the real problem within our agricultural support policy, namely the fact that about 80 % of agricultural subsidies are still being paid to only 20 % of all farmers and that the beneficiaries are the most prosperous farmers rather than those whose need is greatest."
"There is not an ounce of social justice in that, Commissioner, and I am certainly grateful to you for having replied last year to a written question from a doubting Thomas - his real name is not Thomas - in the PPE Group, by reaffirming that there has been no fundamental change in this intolerable situation."
"Not until we have eliminated this problem shall we obtain the support of the European taxpayers for a new and sustainable policy for rural areas."
"We need that, not least because of our 20 million unemployed, and we need a support system that will put an end to this lunacy whereby a farming millionaire - whose millions I do not envy him, because he and I will meet the same end - to this ludicrous situation whereby this farming millionaire receives tax subsidies he does not need while there are others in rural areas who need them desperately: smallholders, for example, who basically have no option but to work themselves into the ground to eke out a living."
"We then need an effective support ceiling, which should only be raised if we resurrect old solidarity requirements, and I refer specifically to the requirement that everyone should have the right to a decent job."
"If this additional requirement is fulfilled, we can think further ahead."
"We also need - and this, of course, is something we have been discussing today - a new integrated policy for the less-favoured areas."
"I emphatically endorse everything, Commissioner, that you and some of the Members of this House have said about the danger of starting to think again in terms of several little money jars - one for mountain regions, one for maritime regions, one for moorland regions, one for wetland regions."
"All of these regions do deserve help, but they deserve help because they all have a shared problem: they simply cannot compete with the economically stronger regions, but they still have to be kept alive."
"That is why I would warn everyone against a continuation of this piecemeal approach."
"The basic elements of the Commission's ideas which I have read about are undoubtedly sound."
"An integrated rural policy must also ensure that new jobs are created in rural areas."
"By that I mean not only employment in agriculture or related sectors, but also high-tech jobs."
"Advanced technology does no harm to rural areas."
"That is why the microchip factory in Untermagerbein, which is near my home, must be basically feasible."
"These things need not always be in the centres of population; they can be located elsewhere."
"We have actually talked enough about all these principles."
"In 1996, we adopted my report by a large majority, and I should be pleased if all my fellow Members were prepared to vote for these things, not for the sake of bringing the discussion to an end, but so that these proposals can be turned at long last into concrete policies in your own countries."
"For some of those who were sitting here just a short time ago, it would serve as a timely reminder to do that in their countries."
"The gradual demise of many villages in your countries and in mine will ultimately lead to the decline of rural areas in general."
"These areas account for 80 % of our European territory."
"And our Europe will only have a future if its rural areas have a future too."
"That will only be the case if we finally stop producing new paperwork."
"Let us create a future for our rural areas, and then we shall preserve Europe."
"Madam President, I think that Mr Rehder has produced a splendid and very interesting report on the financial report of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund."
"It is always important - we also talked about this earlier today - to ensure that the EU taxpayers' money is spent prudently."
"I also think it is crucial that we in Parliament adopt the position of those who take a critical line on what we see."
"That must be our task as democratically elected representatives, and that is the approach adopted in Mr Rehder's report."
"The Commission's report on agricultural expenditure for the financial year 1996 is in many respects an excellent report."
"It gives an account of factors which have affected the expenditure on agriculture in the year in question: enlargement of the Union to 15 countries, implementation of aid during the 1992 reform and expenditure associated with the BSE crisis."
"In addition the Commission also reports on the implementation of a new factor, which I think is very important, namely a plan to avoid fraud against funds for agricultural support."
"The plan involves the setting up of a database, registration of control systems, identification and more detailed registration of stocks."
"All well and good!"
"There are of course some who get into difficulties, in my country too, as a result of what is called excessive bureaucracy, but it is good that we have these things."
"When we pay out money, we must also be sure that there is proper control."
"On the other hand, I do not think that the Commission's report pays enough attention to the way the funds are used in the Member States."
"The problem with control is that it varies from one Member State to another."
"In other words, one cannot expect that people will be treated uniformly in the various countries of the Union, even though uniform rules are actually applicable."
"That is not good enough!"
"That cannot continue indefinitely."
"We need to have proper control over the use of all these resources."
"Of course I know exactly what the Commission will say: do you want more bureaucracy?"
"Do you want to make things even more difficult?"
"And of course that puts us on the spot."
"We need to create a system that can also function."
"It is thus clearly also necessary to ensure that the agricultural reform points in the direction of a more transparent system than we have at present."
"I want to say to end with - and Mr Rehder also had something to say about this - that social imbalances are manifest in the way the funds are distributed."
"We can see quite clearly - and the Commission's report says nothing about this, but we can see - that 80 % of the funding goes to 20 % of the farmers."
"What is the reason for that?"
"No doubt there are many explanations, but I really think the Commission owes us an answer as to what it considers the explanation to be."
"Madam President, first of all, let me say that I welcome the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has delivered an opinion on agricultural expenditure in 1996, since this is normally the job of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I think that it is extremely important for the agricultural sector itself to do everything it can to ensure that the agriculture budget is spent correctly, because when we talk about irregularities and fraud in the farming sector it is not primarily the farmers or growers who are responsible, but other areas of agriculture."
"If we want to increase support for farmers in Europe, which is what all of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wish to see, we must ensure that money is spent correctly, and I think that Mr Rehder's report makes a significant contribution here."
"The previous speaker has already thanked Commissioner Fischler for staying here for such a long time, and I would like to pay him another compliment, even though this is something he is not exactly used to receiving here in the Chamber."
"We very much appreciate the fact that the Commission has complied with the Budgetary Control Committee's demands relating to the 1992 discharge, which come up again indirectly in the 1996 report, for 15 extra officials to be appointed to improve monitoring, and for an extra 25 % fine to be imposed if Member States do not implement agricultural expenditure correctly."
"I think this is one way in which controls can be improved."
"Regarding the rest of the Rehder report, I agree with the previous speaker - and it has nothing to do with the kind words he said about me - that there are a number of points which actually have nothing to do with the financial report for 1996."
"Over the next few months, we shall be looking in detail at all the problems associated with Agenda 2000 - and whether the 80/20 ratio is fair or not, I think it is inevitable that some sectors will always receive more than others, because some sectors will always be close to the soil."
"If we want to maintain the countryside we must, by definition, give it more money than we give to a greenhouse, or whatever."
"You cannot just say that all sectors must receive an equal percentage of the agriculture budget."
"I cannot agree with this approach."
"One final point about the accompanying measures."
"I have just heard that the report is to come out any day now, perhaps as early as next week."
"This is excellent news."
"I think that one of the main points in future discussions will be how to combine the environment and agriculture."
"I would be curious to know exactly why it is that only five of the 15 Member States are making use of the accompanying measures."
"Austria is a good example, but that could have something to do with the Commissioner here."
"However, I would really like to know why certain environmental measures are successful in some countries but not others."
"If we can find out the secret of how they should be applied in countries where they are not successful, I think we will be on the right road in spending the agriculture budget."
"Madam President, I do not want to over-egg the situation but I would like to follow on from Mr Mulder and pay tribute to the Commissioner for his patience and fortitude in staying to this late hour to listen to us going on about him."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on bringing forward a thought-provoking report on the EAGGF."
"Mr Rehder calls into question many important points and we can quite readily take them on board this evening."
"One of the things referred to which struck me immediately is the complicated life the farmer now leads because of the number of forms he has to fill in."
"Most farmers are prepared to fill in as many forms as necessary to get whatever support or aid they require but there is an argument that the forms could be easier to complete."
"I am sure the Commissioner is aware of forms which are highly complicated and technical."
"I know these forms assist in controlling fraud but there should be a greater degree of flexibility at local level."
"I receive regular complaints from constituents who have made genuine, innocent mistakes in their application or claim form resulting in the refusal of a grant."
"They come to me as their MEP because they have been told that at local level there is no discretion to recognise what is a genuine mistake."
"That is one area we could look at to make the system more user-friendly to the farmer."
"At the moment in Northern Ireland there is no structural support."
"The relevant programme was so popular that it was oversubscribed and no more applications could be accepted."
"That shows the importance of such support to rural communities and farmers especially at this very difficult time."
"We have to try to address some of the points Mr Rehder and Mr Mulder have made with regard to the long-term future of the reform package."
"Mr Mulder raised the interesting point of why some national governments are more successful than others in bringing in the environmental measures."
"The answer is that some governments just do not want to introduce these measures."
"It is as simple as that."
"They are not prepared to put up the matching funding that is required to get the measures started."
"We heard about this in the earlier debate."
"So there is a good opportunity for us to debate and find the best way forward."
"Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Rehder for his report."
"He emphasises the cost of the common agricultural policy."
"Yes, it is about 40 % of the Community budget at the moment but that reflects more on the size of the Community budget than on spending on agriculture."
"When you consider the size of the European Union, the number of farmers involved, the area and the problems, we are spending 0.4 % of GDP on the common agricultural policy."
"This is the price we pay for the policy of seeking to maintain the population of the European Union in the rural areas."
"If the policy did not exist, if we left it entirely to market forces, there is no question but that the flight from the land would have been very much accelerated."
"It is disappointing, of course, that we have not succeeded in stabilising the number of people living in rural areas."
"Similarly, today we are spending about the same amount of money on the policy as we spent 15 years ago, but only half the number of farmers are involved."
"I predict that in ten years' time - say, at the end of the next programme - instead of the seven million farmers we have today, we will probably have four million farmers, and yet we will be spending more money."
"When you consider that, along with the point that 80 % of the money is going to 20 % of the farmers, then we have to say that perhaps at the moment it is time - I do not want to decouple it from production entirely - to consider a greater variety of schemes - and certainly now the money can be spread more widely."
"Too few people may be receiving too much money as the whole industry becomes restructured, and some very big producers get the compensation foreseen in the reorganised policy."
"I am a little concerned about it."
"I would like to see a variety of policies that are based more on programmes such as the Leader programme - I know it is going to be retained and strengthened."
"But to maintain the population in the rural world we need to do a bit more than just relate it directly to volumes of production."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am the last speaker this evening, but I do wish to use my two minutes and to thank you for staying with us."
"What are we talking about this evening?"
"We are talking about the support measures, about compensatory measures for our farmers in Europe."
"The guarantee section of the EAGGF mainly finances expenditure in connection with the common agricultural market and pricing policies."
"A large percentage of the fund is used for interventions to regulate the markets for agricultural produce."
"In the 1996 financial year, the agricultural budget ran to ECU 40 828 million, which represents 50.5 % of the general EU budget."
"We did have a rise in the agricultural guideline, precisely because the reform of the CAP, with the aforementioned new criteria, resulted in the aid available to the Member States being fully utilised for the first time, and because the European Union increased in size from 12 to 15 Member States on 1 January 1995."
"However, if we measure this rise against the increase in the general budget, we find that agricultural expenditure has declined by 1.2 %."
"When it comes to dealing with public money, thrift is always a virtue, and expenditure must be seen in the light of the task in hand."
"Turning over the complex field of the common European agricultural policy requires adequate finances, and agriculture is the policy sector which is most comprehensively supported, and indeed monopolised, by the European Union."
"Besides compensatory support schemes for productive holdings, the European Union also provides accompanying measures which reflect its responsibility for the environment and for the victims of structural change."
"These measures are important, and I welcome the proposals in this area, Commissioner, which you have made in the Agenda 2000 framework."
"I support the rapporteur's call for greater transparency, and above all for the simplification of the complex application procedure."
"We shall no doubt have ample opportunity here in Parliament to discuss the future shape of the EAGGF in the framework of Agenda 2000, and I therefore take the view that points 11 and 12 do not belong in this report on the financial year 1996."
"Thank you, Mrs Klaß."
"I have seen something quite remarkable during my spell in the Chair this evening."
"Everyone has shown a respect for their speaking time tonight which could hardly be bettered."
"In conclusion, I now give the floor to Mr Fischler."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have no wish to try your patience at this time."
"Let me begin by expressing my sincere thanks to Mr Rehder for the report and to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the interest that has been taken in this twenty-sixth financial report on the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur for supporting the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"In the present context, however, I believe there is no need for us to engage in a debate on Agenda 2000."
"We shall have many more opportunities to do that, and the same applies to the own-resources report."
"But when I am asked why the environmental measures and the accompanying measures have been so successful in the country with which I am undoubtedly most familiar, my reply is that there seem to be are two decisive reasons for this."
"The first is that we began back in 1987 with comprehensive fact-finding and discussions on the need for multifunctional agriculture, and that we perhaps developed a few things rather earlier than was the case elsewhere."
"Let me give one small example from my time in charge of the agricultural portfolio."
"When I was appointed Minister of Agriculture in 1989, I inherited a budget of two million Austrian schillings for the promotion of organic farming, and when I left the Ministry a few years later some 270 million schillings had been earmarked for that purpose."
"The second significant reason is simply the fact that there is a social consensus in the country on the need to take an appropriate degree of national responsibility for conserving the countryside and safeguarding sustainable forms of agriculture."
"Raising the requisite funds to cofinance these measures has never really been a problem in Austria."
"But now to the business in hand."
"I should like to limit my remarks to a few main points that relate directly to the financial report."
"First of all, there is the matter of the unused funds."
"Let me place on record that the volume of unused funds was halved from 1995 to 1996, and in the following financial year, 1997, it has been further reduced to about ECU 400 million."
"This is equivalent to the Community's financial obligations in the agricultural sector for about two days in the year."
"As far as the expenditure estimates in this sector are concerned, because of various imponderables there will always be a certain margin of error, since nobody can forecast the weather or market trends with absolute certainty."
"As regards checks on expenditure, I fully subscribe to the view expressed by the rapporteur."
"As for the rejection of considerable amounts of expenditure during the clearance of accounts, I will concede that this is partly caused by complex application procedures and by inadequate checking in the Member States."
"Many of the rejections, however, are also due to the fact that the Member States' interpretation of the CAP implementing provisions has differed from that of the Commission. We want to eliminate these problems and have adopted a number of measures to that end."
"We are trying to simplify the provisions in question and formulate them more clearly, so that these dubious interpretations can be avoided as far as possible."
"Part of this effort is being made in the Agenda 2000 framework, but there are other vehicles too, especially the SEM 2000 project."
"Then we are supporting the Member States as they try to solve their verification problems; this support is provided through measures covered by budget chapter B1-3600."
"In addition, we are trying to improve the procedure for the clearance of accounts, and we shall continue to apply flat-rate corrections and guidelines to the clearance of accounts."
"On the question of imbalances in our financial support, a point raised by several speakers, I should like to emphasise that we have addressed this problem in our reform proposals."
"We shall simply no longer tolerate a situation in which a small percentage of farms receive the bulk of the grants."
"Let me stress that one of the aims of the common agricultural policy is to ensure that producers receive appropriate incomes."
"To achieve this goal, however, farms must not rely solely on grant aid."
"We need more market orientation, primarily so that enterprising farmers and processing businesses can take full advantage of the opportunities available to them."
"The market situation is good and well balanced for many products I can think of, particularly wine, fruit, vegetables and other - mainly specialised - types of produce, and producers can secure an appropriate level of income by selling in these markets."
"As for the more technical issues concerning the budget guideline and the expenditure forecast, I am interested in the proposal for the establishment of a general budgetary reserve covering the estimated funding requirement but within the guideline framework."
"When it comes to the matter of repaying unused funds to the Member States, the bottom line is that the EAGGF appropriations are only provisional estimates."
"To that extent, the repayment rule contained in the regulations is justified, and it would no doubt be very difficult to have this rule amended."
"Thank you, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have nothing to say about the Minutes, I am perfectly happy with them. Yesterday, however, an amendment by the Liberals on the Viola report was rejected for some incomprehensible reason."
"It was all about making the institutions more environmentally friendly. I would therefore like to put the following request to you."
"If you wish to promote the use of bicycles here in Strasbourg, you need to ensure that there are adequate covered bicycle racks, but if you look in the garage, the racks are by no means sufficient for the Members and their assistants."
"Could I ask you to increase the number of bicycle racks in the garage at the expense of perhaps two car-parking spaces?"
"Thank you, Mr Eisma."
"I have taken note of your request and I will pass it on to the Bureau and, in particular, to the College of Quaestors so that they may examine this matter in the most positive light possible."
"Mr President, regarding the Minutes on my speech yesterday, I want to raise a point."
"I mentioned at the end of my speech on Pinochet that I feared that the British Government was about to do a deal to let him go."
"In this morning's Guardian it is reported that precisely that is going to happen."
"I just want to confirm that my prediction was correct."
"Mr Kerr, you are aware of the leniency of this Chair, particularly on Friday mornings, which are peaceful days."
"But this has nothing to do with the Minutes."
"I see that there are no comments on the Minutes."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I have, on a number of occasions on a Friday, raised the fact that this sitting, which is often a very good sitting, is not televised."
"It is not available for television companies to use and it is not available for archives."
"I should again like to press the point and ask when this sitting is going to be properly televised and treated like any other."
"Mr Hallam, I note your concern, which I share because, being in the Chair, I could appear more often on television but, in all events, Mr Hallam, I will not forget to pass this matter on to the appropriate authorities."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, I merely asked for the floor to make a brief preliminary remark concerning the amendments which have been tabled."
"This report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture, after which a compromise was reached with certain groups which had tabled amendments on a point of substance."
"The report on a strategy for mountain regions is a more thorough examination of one aspect of a general report, submitted during the last parliamentary term, on less-favoured areas in the broader sense."
"Mrs Anttila, who is here with us today, is to present a report on Arctic areas within a few days from now."
"During the next term of Parliament, someone will be presenting a detailed report on arid and semi-arid zones, a subject already dealt with many years ago."
"I now have to put to the House some amendments from a single group, the EDN Group, the same amendments on which we had reached agreement in the text of the report, and which seek to generalise the issue once again, thereby taking us a step backwards."
"We have the opportunity today of exploring one specific aspect of this subject, while other aspects are dealt with in other reports."
"This means that we have a possibility at last of getting right to the heart of various problems, without restricting ourselves on every occasion to grand declarations of principle which everyone can endorse but are neither down-toearth nor practical."
"That is why I can accept only some of these amendments: those which do not detract from the concrete, pragmatic nature of this report and, above all, do not conflict with its title."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr Wijsenbeek has a point of order."
"Mr President, as this week has been rather heavy with its three voting sessions, I am not asking for a secret ballot pursuant to Rule 121, but for a more discreet vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would refer to the Rules of Procedure and ask your respectful silence to give Mr Wijsenbeek and also this Chair a degree of peace."
"Mr President, I feel that I must comment on the result of this vote."
"It was a fine exercise in parliamentary democracy, without a doubt."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy was right: we were simply voting on the addition of four words, the usual four, in all the amendments."
"These are the four words which distort the original intention of this report, intended to cover mountain regions exclusively, given that - I repeat - arid areas have already been discussed and Arctic areas are to be discussed at next month's plenary."
"It would be as if I were to resubmit all my amendments on mountain regions next month, on Mrs Anttila's report."
"This has been another case of indulging in grandiose declarations, but yet another total failure to get to grips with the real issues."
"Nothing changes, the report is perfectly valid - that is why I did not ask the chairman of my group to vote against it - but once again we are talking a lot of hot air."
"We are incapable of producing down-to-earth legislation with which our citizens can identify."
"Mr Santini, it is not the Chair's practice to cut speakers short, but please bear in mind that your statement is virtually an explanation of vote and re-opens the entire debate."
"But I do not intend to reopen this debate."
"We have already voted on this matter and the vote is the most democratic expression of our Parliament."
"It is important for farmers and foresters to be able to maintain their livelihoods when soil conditions change."
"One option is to switch from farming to forestry, while preserving enough farmland for food production."
"Soil is a natural resource that needs nurturing."
"Changes in land use must be accompanied by environmental and natural resource analyses, and a woodland certification system will be required to ensure forestry sustainability."
"It will be necessary to involve organisations representing the farming and forestry sectors in this work. And overhead costs, changes in income, and the effect on the environment will all need evaluating."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"Despite their differences, diversity and individual features, the Union's mountain areas have one thing in common: conditions that make development difficult."
"The very areas which concentrate the Union's greatest ecological heritage and biodiversity - an incalculable environmental asset - as well as traditional activities are facing increasingly acute problems of isolation, underdevelopment, desertion and decline."
"Mountain areas are suffering the consequences of terrible political decisions which are accelerating their decline."
"The natural, demographic and economic problems of these areas have been and are being tackled by inflexible, fragmentary and above all 'symptomatic' policies."
"For example when, thanks to the CAP and GATT, policies are implemented which lead to the continual decline of farming, which is one of the main sources of employment and population maintenance in the countryside and in mountain regions, which is essential for the conservation of the natural environment and which does much to preserve nature and the countryside, how can it be possible to maintain and encourage the development of the countryside and of mountain areas and regions?"
"When quota restrictions are constantly being imposed on the production of basic mountain agricultural and livestock products, a problem which is particularly acute for southern products which cannot be replaced by others in the primary sector for reasons related to soil and climate, it is impossible to keep people and especially young people in those areas because of the lack of jobs, adequate incomes and a decent standard of living."
"It is not by chance that Epirus in Greece, which is predominantly a mountainous area, is the poorest region in the EU, with Objective 1 status."
"And all this at a time when the 'Agenda 2000' proposals are preparing further cutbacks in the agricultural economy and are advocating major changes which restrict the aid provided by the Structural Funds."
"At the same time, the large distances which as a rule separate those areas from urban centres, their particularly difficult climatic conditions, the lack of infrastructure and appropriate technical support, and their inadequate and inappropriate road network, lead to isolation and restrict the potential for making the most of local products and for the proper operation of local markets, for the development of new economic activities, for the maintenance of satisfactory health levels, for education and for cultural activity."
"Those problems are not only not being addressed, they are becoming worse."
"Indeed, they tend to be regarded as permanent, inherent, even natural 'geographical' disadvantages."
"Current policies need to be redirected immediately, and new policies must be developed which are capable of addressing and reversing the dangerous rate at which the Union's mountain areas are being abandoned and deserted, and providing real incentives for the development of those areas - incentives for the maintenance of population, jobs and income, for the development of primary and secondary production, the upgrading of infrastructure, improvements to the road networks and transport facilities, and for the organisation and provision of goodquality health and education services."
"Agricultural support is very unevenly allocated."
"Big farms and holdings in well-to-do agricultural regions receive large amounts of aid, while small ones in peripheral and sparsely populated areas receive very little."
"The support system is complicated, and trying to understand it uses up farmers' and society's time and resources."
"We need to gradually move towards paying more for what is produced and imposing less regulation and control."
"It would be a mistake to do as the rapporteur suggests and further extend the system of checks carried out by the Member States."
"The whole philosophy of increased surveillance and greater zeal in combating infringements of 'EU law' is misplaced, and will simply bolster the existing suspicion of both EU and national agricultural administrations."
"We should strike out in the opposite direction, with less rules and controls, working for more market penetration and rewarding quality."
"We were not able to vote for the Rehder report for the following reasons."
"Firstly, and most importantly, because of what the report says about the 'outstanding' EAGGF appropriations."
"The rapporteur proposes that we should examine the possibility of keeping this available for the CAP, instead of repaying it to the Member States."
"If by 'outstanding' appropriations he meant money that had been entered in the budget for a particular year but was then not spent, I would agree."
"But this is not the case in this report."
"Recital F indicates that, for the rapporteur, 'outstanding' appropriations means the difference between the agriculture guideline and agricultural expenditure, and he wants to use all of this margin for the CAP."
"What this really means is that he regards the expenditure ceiling for agriculture as a spending target, which is something we cannot agree with."
"Furthermore, this report is not the right place to be making statements of this kind, and it contains even more sweeping statements about the future common agricultural policy and how it should be financed."
"Such matters should be dealt with in the context of the Agenda 2000 proposals, not in this report."
"Finally, we cannot agree with the description that is given of possible imbalances in the CAP."
"According to the rapporteur, the current agricultural system is socially unbalanced because 80 % of the support goes to only 20 % of the farmers."
"This gives the impression that the aim of the agricultural policy is to give all farmers equal support, but this is not how it is intended."
"One sector may find it perfectly easy to operate profitably in the single market, whereas others desperately need State support."
"Role of libraries"
"The next item is the report (A4-0248/98) by Mrs Ryynänen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the role of libraries in the modern world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before giving the floor to Mrs Ryynänen, could I suggest that you follow Mr Wijsenbeek's advice?"
"I would ask you to be quiet, because we should like to hear what Mrs Ryynänen has to say."
"I now give the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs Ryynänen, for five minutes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the information society knowledge is a vital resource and information the most important raw material."
"It is high time libraries were made the cornerstone of the debate, as their significance and their potential as meeting points for many phenomena relating to the information society have not yet been fully grasped."
"One of the greatest threats with the information society is the growth of inequality."
"It is libraries that can guarantee that all people have the opportunity to make use of the information and cultural input they require, irrespective of the form in which it is packaged, from the traditional printed word to the newest on-line data."
"As on-line data becomes more common, the role of libraries is changing, but not declining."
"They are becoming especially important as expert organisers of data obtained off the net."
"In the deluge of information available we need guidance and signposts, so that anyone can get the answer they require."
"Democracy, openness and active citizenship can only come about if everybody is able to access data such as legislation, decisions taken by other countries' governments, including EU data, and, for example, the press with up-to-date accounts of events."
"There have been good reports about European information points at libraries."
"More generally, we must make sure that data accessibility continues to be funded with the aid of tax revenue, and that the service remains free."
"Producing on-line versions of catalogues, maps and statistics can ease the general process of accessing such information considerably, as it can be done very cheaply in terms of distribution costs."
"The free-of-charge policy that exists for the basic services that public libraries offer is contained in the Unesco Public Library Manifest, yet reports indicate that lending charges have started to be introduced in many places."
"The result has been a drop in the number of readers, that is to say the accumulated educational capital has a poor take-up rate, and the economic problems that libraries face will not be solved with the meagre revenue from charges."
"The question of funds for libraries is something that has to be rethought all over Europe."
"With current resources they will not be able to rise to the challenges of their task to provide diverse and traditional cultural and information services as well as the challenges of the information society."
"However, lifelong learning in the information society puts even greater demands on libraries for the efficient utilisation of all manner of data and professional knowledge."
"Further and complementary training in the library and information sector is a major challenge, and it is here that European cooperation can produce results."
"Investment in information technology for libraries has to be seen as a major part of the basic infrastructure of the information society."
"As information gets to be an ever more essential factor in production, it is worth investing common resources in its dissemination."
"Pressure on the economy of libraries is due, for example, to fees they have to pay for housing electronic data, and converting catalogues and original data, in other words all their vast cultural heritage, into digital form."
"When they are most effective, libraries function as networks that transcend all borders, including national ones."
"Unfortunately, networking has barely got under way in Europe."
"It is important that the Telematics for Libraries programme which was launched in 1990 and started a splendid process of cooperation should be extended in the fifth framework programme of research and technical development."
"We need an EU library know-how centre to coordinate developments in the European library sector and to promote research and complementary education in the field."
"At present we also lack comparisons of services offered by libraries in different parts of the Community."
"Cooperation between libraries is rising high on the agenda in the information society strategies of central and eastern European countries, and in their endeavours to strengthen democracy."
"In the current debate on copyright, libraries, archives and museums represent the view of the citizen and the user."
"Safeguarding the institution of copyright and prevention of the illegal dissemination of information is only right, and is an important objective for libraries too."
"The present balance that exists between the copyright-holder and the user of material should be maintained."
"It is important, therefore, clearly to define the exceptions to exclusive copyright that safeguard the rights of libraries and users."
"The ban on the use of digital information and cultural input should not be allowed to expand."
"Unnecessarily tight restrictions on the use of a library, for example, by excluding private study, is at odds with the principles of lifelong learning."
"Copyright legislation that is too stringent may, contrary to its aims, impair intellectual productivity in Europe."
"I hope the Commission, when preparing its green paper on the role of libraries in the information society, considers the views expressed in this report and takes them on board in order to promote a democratic information society for our citizens."
"Mr President, Mrs Ryynänen, thank you for a splendid report."
"Our main concern about the information society is that we will become divided into those who can afford to access information and those who cannot; that is to say, the information-rich and the information-poor."
"This gap must be narrowed by all the means available to us."
"In Finland and other countries we have done this with the aid of the institution of the library, and we have been very successful."
"We are the best-read nation in the world."
"The essential task of the nation's libraries is to safeguard the framework of the educational and cultural system, and this is especially important with the minority language groups, which are difficult for the majority language groups to understand."
"Under the Copyright Directive, electronic data may not be viewed on a computer screen by library users, meaning ordinary people, unless a special agreement is made with the copyright-holders."
"This poses a threat to the modern library service, and is a big problem for the issues of equality, education and culture in the information society."
"I consider this to be a stupid mistake which threatens to ruin the work of an institution that has proved particularly cost-effective in the culture sector, since libraries would then not be able to fulfil their task as providers of information."
"They are free of charge to each citizen, and that helps those who cannot afford to purchase all the products needed."
"This is something we have got used to."
"The library has become a sort of church of information."
"People need it and use it."
"If its work is now to be impeded because of digitalisation and reproduction, then we will, depressingly, be taking a step backwards in the field of education, whereas we should all be doing our level best to develop it."
"As I believe that this is rooted in ignorance, my position is that we change the Copyright Directive to enable libraries to continue their work and increase their educational role as a promoter of equality, and one that represents wisdom and justice, in today's information society."
"Mr President, I would like to express the full support of the Group of the European People's Party to the rapporteur, Mrs Ryynänen, for her excellent report, and I will confine my remarks to a single point. Although we generally transmit only good news on Fridays, and particularly when Commissioner Fischler is present as a representative of the European Commission, today, Mr President, when discussing libraries, we must inform public opinion that our libraries are dying a slow death."
"Millions of books in our libraries are being destroyed little by little."
"Our libraries are seriously ill, particularly the younger ones."
"It is no exaggeration to say that we have an obligation to save our libraries."
"Let me remind the House, Mr President, of the well-known fact that one third of the books published during the last 150 years are self-destructing."
"The problem lies in the type of paper used."
"Until 1803, paper was manufactured using linen or cotton fibres, which were stable and long-lasting."
"In the middle of the 19th century, the heavy demand for paper led to the introduction of the so-called acid papers, which used a cellulose pulp base obtained from wood."
"Experience shows that this type of paper only lasts several decades."
"The extent of the deterioration of library collections is alarming."
"It is estimated that approximately one third of the volumes in the collections of major libraries are in a bad condition."
"We are talking about libraries such as that of the Congress of the United States, or the National Library of Paris, with 11 million volumes."
"Therefore, this is a serious problem."
"And the problem is by no means new."
"Since 1990, we have been asking the Commission for equivalent resolutions and standards relating to the use of permanent paper and information for consumers."
"Commissioner, we would like to know what is happening with these requests that we have been making to the Commission for almost eight years."
"Mr President, Mrs Ryynänen's report, now under discussion, gives us a very clear picture of the role of the library in modern society."
"At the same time it maps out, in excellent fashion, the huge potential and the challenges to be faced on the part of the institution of the library over the coming years."
"The report was put together with care and skill, in accordance with the best Finnish traditions of culture and education, and I wish to convey my warmest congratulations and thanks to Mrs Ryynänen for her work."
"Education and culture are geared to development."
"They are also small countries' only protection."
"When, for example, the EU puts together its development programmes, they might well flounder in recipient countries as a result of poor levels of education."
"Libraries have always been powerful aids when it comes to national education, allowing the whole spectrum and all the best of human culture to be enjoyed by the entire nation."
"They have supplied comprehensible and varied information, and provided information on skills and new discoveries, as well as applications in different sectors."
"The importance of libraries in raising the education and living standards of western countries is enormous."
"On the other hand, knowledge is power."
"Control of information means power, and a lack of information means a lack of influence."
"If national standards of education are not attended to, the result is a critical level of social inequality."
"The key to library development is the definition of incorporeal rights."
"Copyright is a very important part of the western judicial system, safeguarding the rights of inventors, science and scientists."
"It also safeguards development in many fields."
"Mrs Ryynänen's approach in this matter is the right one."
"While it keeps the institution of the library user-friendly and recognises it as the best cultural institution with such limited funding, it also puts forward an appropriate solution for the future development of copyright."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Ryynänen on this own-initiative report, which I think reveals the European Union's great potential for adopting initiatives in a range of areas relating to knowledge and civilisation, both now and in the future."
"We fully support Mrs Ryynänen's views."
"I would like to mention two points concerning the situation in Greece."
"First, the possibility of providing libraries is not just a matter of economics."
"Very often, the educational system too can play a major part, encouraging the young or even older people to make use of libraries. Very often too it can lock them out, imposing prohibitive restrictions on the use of these great repositories of human knowledge."
"Greece is a typical example of the latter, and I confess that I felt a certain envy when listening to what happens in Finland."
"In Greece, typically, all highschool students, as they approach their examinations for admission to university education, have to memorise one book, just one book in each subject!"
"If a student quotes from any other books, then he or she is sure to fail."
"A student who can put all the commas, full-stops and dashes in the right places gets top marks."
"The characteristic picture in Greek families with students finishing high-school is that in the evening, when the father or mother get home from work, the 17- or 18-year-old child sits there reciting the book to them from memory, because self-testing is not good enough."
"Consequently, where the use of books is concerned, the educational system can contribute much, either positively as I believe happens in Finland, or negatively as I believe happens in Greece."
"The second point I want to mention concerns the special effort we must make to promote libraries in the European Union's major cities which specialise in the culture, civilisation and knowledge of other peoples and languages of the EU."
"I say this because, unfortunately, in many university faculties which have their own libraries, such as in Modern Greek studies in large cities such as Berlin, Munich and other cities in Germany, all that fund of knowledge is now declining, vegetating and at risk of disappearing completely."
"In that sense, I think a general impetus to promote libraries, one which would attach special importance to those concerned with the languages and cultures of other EU countries, would be a very positive development."
"Mr President, one of the earlier Finnish speakers said that libraries were very important in Finland."
"I hesitate to suggest that this is because in their long dark winters there is nothing else to do but read books."
"I know in fact from my visits to Finland with Mrs Ryynänen there is much else to do, not least go to the wonderful Savonlinna Opera Festival."
"I was very impressed with the library provision and the importance of libraries in Finland and I commend Mrs Ryynänen's report."
"It is an excellent report from an excellent member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"We have had many good discussions in the Culture Committee on this report and I hope due notice is taken of it by the Commission when it brings forward its directive."
"It is an excellent basis for the green paper."
"Libraries are extremely important for our civilisation and culture in Europe."
"Personally I have benefited enormously from them."
"I left school at 15, went to university at 20 as an adult student and was able to do this because I had a friend who was a librarian."
"He gave me a private space in the local library, supplied me with books, found reports for me and helped me to reconstruct my studies."
"It helped me to go on and take several degrees and eventually become a university lecturer."
"In Scotland I shall be standing for the new Scottish Socialist Party - I thought I would get a mention into the Rainbow, we launched it last month - and I have made sure that we have a strong commitment to public libraries in the policies of that party."
"This is important in Britain because in the last 18 years we had cuts in library resources and provisions by the Conservative Government."
"And I have to say that this is continuing under the New Labour regime which pays lip service to knowledge and education but continues to cut local authority library resources."
"Libraries are under extreme pressure in the UK."
"So I hope this report will have its significance."
"On a lighter note, I would conclude by saying that library cards are sometimes very useful sources of identification."
"My Scottish colleague Hugh McMahon tells me he got into Hungary once using his library card as the source of identification."
"But he did have Otto von Habsburg with him at the time, so maybe that helped."
"Thank you, Mr Kerr."
"You have just mentioned Mr Otto von Habsburg. Most unusually, he is not with us today because he is ill."
"I take advantage of the fact that you have mentioned Mr von Habsburg to wish him a prompt recovery, on behalf of the House."
"On Fridays, we need him here."
"Mr President, I agree with all the recommendations contained in the report, which gives an accurate picture of the current problems."
"Listening to the debate here, I can see that the situation varies greatly between the Member States, and I must confess to being a little disappointed with the text of the actual resolution after the recitals."
"I am still a fervent supporter of the principle of subsidiarity, and I therefore feel that the European Parliament should not be pointing a critical finger where it has no instruments and no powers to change anything."
"Quite the reverse is true, of course, when it comes to the recommendations for the Commission, which I have to say is doing very little in practice."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner responsible for culture what progress has been made on harmonising copyright and the concerns expressed in this report."
"We all know that libraries have changed: they are no longer just places where books are stored, they have become information centres with Internet connections for the public, and they are becoming the focus of the learning society in which we will all soon be living."
"I am therefore very pleased with the report and its recommendations, though I am not so happy with the rather critical tone it adopts, implying as it does that things are not going as they should be anywhere."
"I think that what we actually need is some sort of exchange of information to show just how much progress some countries have made."
"Mr President, the role of libraries in modern society has changed enormously."
"In the past, when you went to a library, there were impressive long rows of books that you could take off the shelf, have stamped and take away with you. Nowadays modern university libraries do not have books any more, but computers where you can look a book up and request it using keywords."
"Fifteen minutes later you can take the book away with you."
"In the near future, more libraries will have become virtual libraries providing people with information in every possible form."
"All this is described in an accurate and informative way in Mrs Ryynänen's report, and I welcome the fact that we are anticipating these developments."
"I agree that libraries need to work with each other at European level, and for me the main question here is which institution should deal with this."
"It is not clear from the report why the Commission and Parliament should take this on."
"Is it not more obviously a job for the Council of Europe and UNESCO?"
"Is there not an overlapping of responsibilities here?"
"I think the arguments for dealing with this own-initiative report here in the European Parliament are rather weak."
"The motion for a resolution also talks about a modest approach and organisation, so this is obviously an area where Europe does not want to arouse high expectations."
"In view of all this, my main problem is with the passage in the resolution which calls on the Commission to speed up the production of the green paper on the role of libraries."
"Subjects such as copyright, royalties and a European library network are important, but here again I feel that they are more a job for the Council of Europe or UNESCO."
"If these issues were dealt with by the Council of Europe, there would be an even broader basis for cooperation because of the number of countries involved."
"On the subject of copyright, the report fails to make any reference to the copyright convention of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the WIPO Convention."
"I agree that there is a problem with acid paper, and I would welcome European regulations promoting the use of 'permanent' paper."
"I would support a Parliament recommendation on this, but calling on the Commission to produce a directive on the subject before the green paper is even out seems to be going a little too far at the moment."
"In my view, the European Parliament does not need to make resources available to promote cooperation."
"Cooperation between libraries is an excellent idea, but I think that it is really up to the Member States to encourage it."
"There are a lot of very valuable ideas in the resolution, and the report rightly stresses the importance of libraries for society."
"As it says, libraries are important cultural centres, repositories of knowledge, information-providers and social forums."
"We need to take care of them."
"Libraries also have to move with the times."
"It is a big step to switch from just books to all possible forms of information such as cassettes, CD-ROMs and networks."
"I doubt whether the new media will completely replace the old, as the explanatory statement says, and I myself would stress the importance of the printed book."
"This is part of how I envisage the transition from the bibliographical age to the visual or virtual age."
"The American cultural philosopher Neil Postman has some very interesting things to say about this in his book 'Amusing to Death', which was published in Dutch as 'Wij amuseren ons kapot '."
"What could be nicer than to sit by an open fire with a glass of wine and a good library book?"
"That seems more appealing to me than sitting at a desk looking at all sorts of electronic documents on a screen."
"But as I have already said, libraries need to move with the times."
"My conclusion is that this is an excellent report with a very informative explanatory statement, but it is really something that the Council of Europe should deal with now, and Parliament could review at another time."
"Mr President, this report is an important and extensive piece of work on the role of libraries."
"As a member of PEN, I am always glad when Parliament deals with these subjects that are on the periphery of major world politics."
"But I must call into question the historical roots behind the library idea, two of which were very important."
"The first is to make it possible for the general public to read without having to buy the book, and the second is to enable them to find books which simply could not be found at that time in the many small bookshops."
"But both these circumstances have since changed."
"Today, books are in the main cheaper and, in what is known as the modern mega-store, every book is in stock anyway."
"The challenge is therefore not merely a quantitative one - and this is the weakness of the report - but has more to do with making a qualitative contribution towards solving the problem."
"We lack the ideas which would respond to modern consumer needs."
"We must ask ourselves why fewer and fewer people are going to libraries."
"If consumers no longer need them, then it is the job of libraries, and libraries alone, to win them back."
"The report also mentions that libraries are probably never going to be a profit-making undertaking."
"They are responsible, though, for arousing interest in consumers, so that they want to come back again and read."
"Perhaps not just to read: maybe in future the library could be an intellectual database at the population's disposal."
"With the modern techniques of electronic networking, the modern library could be linked up to all the libraries and archives in the world, thereby giving worldwide access to documents, articles and books, as well as all the other publications available."
"This for instance would be a service that no bookshop, however large, could provide for consumers, and it would raise libraries' ability to compete."
"We come back again and again to the problem of lifelong learning."
"It is a right that we are going to have to prepare ourselves for."
"Economic differences today are no longer a result of whether individuals can afford a book or not."
"That was long ago."
"Today, it is more to do with access to electronic information media, and by making learning generally available, modern libraries could help to open up lifelong learning to everyone."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs Ryynänen on a most comprehensive report, and especially for focusing on the question of the future, because if the institution of the library does not respond to the new, its importance will wane."
"Libraries must keep abreast of the times and, preferably, be ahead of them."
"Everybody must be able to use libraries to obtain with ease the information they want."
"The basic principles of public libraries must include a service that is free of charge to users."
"I disagree with the previous speaker that charging for books would not cause people problems in seeking information."
"In Finland, at least, books are so expensive that only a few people can afford to buy everything they need for study purposes, or for cultural reasons, for example."
"The word library conjures up images of shelves full of books and lending facilities, but for decades it has served as a place to store records in ever-changing forms, and new electronic services and networks are increasing all the time."
"Knowledge is to be found on the Internet these days, rather than on library shelves."
"This form of information must also be available to everyone on exactly the same basis of equality as other data."
"The Copyright Directive and other systems in place to protect people's rights must not prevent ordinary citizens from accessing the information they seek."
"For example, in Finland, which has provided examples for other issues we are discussing here, we have what we call library compensation scheme, under which copyright-holders are paid royalties, on an equal basis, for works of theirs that are available to the public."
"The adoption of this practice and its extension to other areas of information might be worth considering."
"The institution of the library is based on serving citizens in their varying quests for information."
"The library is also an institution used by the majority of citizens, an information bank for every man and woman."
"This is vital from the point of view of society's objectives of social equality and for democratic development."
"I hope that in the future there will be still more cross-border cooperation in the area of library development; the new technologies already require it."
"Cooperation must above all be based on an endeavour to discover ways of working that can be applied in different countries."
"Mr President, may I firstly thank you for your kind words regarding my father."
"I will telephone him in a few minutes and pass on your greetings and those of the House."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her report, which I believe has been drawn up at a particularly important time, as Parliament is currently giving more comprehensive thought to new technologies and to copyright issues."
"I also think that it is very important for this report to be dealt with during this Parliament, before the Barzanti report is discussed in plenary at the end of this year, and before my own report on the World Intellectual Property Organisation."
"The amendments that I have tabled to the Barzanti report are concerned specifically with library issues."
"I believe that in this regard we simply cannot forget what a remarkable role libraries have played in history."
"If we consider the loss that the destruction of libraries, from Alexandria through to Sarajevo, have represented to humanity, then I think it is safe to assume that today's libraries will also play a very large role in future."
"I think that Mr Valverde López was right to talk about the very real death of libraries."
"I think we have to be aware of one thing. A library which is dying probably cannot be brought back to life by more money."
"What is needed is better ideas, and these do exist."
"A whole range of studies have been done, for instance by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), or the ZKM in Karlsruhe."
"Not least, a conference was also organised by the ARCH Foundation in Salzburg at the end of last year, which gave scientists and contemporary artists the opportunity to express their views on how the works of the past can be passed on to the future, how they can be better preserved, how they can be protected."
"I think we have a whole series of ideas here, and Mrs Ryynänen's report of course also makes an important contribution to them."
"Mr President, I have learnt from my southern colleagues in this Parliament that half of every speech is dedicated to congratulating the rapporteur, and the speech proper then begins with a 'But'."
"So I will do likewise this time, and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Ryynänen, on the work she has done in the name of education and culture."
"Working together in Parliament as we have been doing now for a long time, I have come to know her as someone who conscientiously applies herself to the issue of education."
"The tradition of reading in the Nordic countries is founded on being able to read, and deciding what to read."
"Libraries help to spread education and culture more evenly among the population."
"The fact that they are free of charge is important, but it conflicts with a current, alternative economic policy: the neo-liberalist pay-to-study phenomenon."
"Neo-liberalism is barbaric."
"According to its doctrine, great wealth is needed to qualify for health and education."
"This kind of economic policy is the death knell for libraries."
"Libraries, however, are helping in the struggle against this alternative approach and the electronic hullabaloo."
"If people are to have a basic right to access information, they must be able to distinguish between order and chaos."
"Library staff have the important task of teaching people to distinguish between education and sensation."
"This was by way of congratulating the rapporteur."
"Now comes the 'but'."
"The rapporteur is calling for the adoption of a panEuropean report on libraries."
"I do not think that is wise."
"It is simply a way of officialising Europropaganda."
"The European Parliament is an example of indoctrinated communications."
"For example, financial assistance is provided for Euro News , which is used to produce electronic Europropaganda."
"When I have followed different reports produced in Parliament, the Secretary-General appears to be the head of Parliament's propaganda section."
"Libraries must be kept independent from the European Union, the European Parliament, and the other official institutions."
"People themselves must have the opportunity to become aware of the options."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by the rapporteur and earlier speakers: of course public libraries will continue to occupy a key role in social and information policy in the information society of tomorrow."
"That is why in the discussion on the Directive on copyright, it was right to insist that libraries should be granted generous copyrights. In contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to emphasise two points in particular."
"Libraries also have to assume new roles."
"Looking at our own patch for example, public libraries could be much more involved as independent bodies providing information on the European Union. I would point to the very well organised network of Public Information Relays in the UK, which link up public libraries specifically offering EU information."
"I hope that as we decentralise the public relations work of the EU, we can also induce libraries to take some of it on."
"I also think libraries could already be doing more in terms of acting as transfer points in communicating contemporary European culture. In practical terms, this could be by way of mutual consultation, by acquiring books and videos from other countries and by directly exchanging stocks of books and multi-media publications with libraries in other countries."
"This would be an important step, in keeping with the spirit of openness and tolerance."
"I think that lending libraries could also quite easily be small Internet centres for schoolchildren and young persons who want to build up small communication networks on European culture, and here of course it is important that access to the networks for educational purposes is free of charge."
"Finally, allow me to make one brief point: if libraries are to continue to offer reasonably-priced access to the cultural wealth provided by books, then in some language areas the tried and tested means of price fixing will be essential to protect the diversity of what is on offer."
"I ask you: should only paperback American bestsellers be available in European libraries in the future?"
"So, I would really urge the Commission not to sink into its dogma of liberalisation and competition, which is not in the citizen's interest, but to give greater thought to private methods of selfregulation in future decisions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by complimenting Mrs Ryynänen on her excellent work."
"Libraries merit special attention within the European Union's cultural strategy, with particular reference to the information society."
"They must be put in a position to play an active role in guaranteeing access to information and in communicating knowledge."
"One fundamental task of libraries is to provide all citizens with basic knowledge and essential information, through works which contribute to an awareness of different identities and origins, fostering the cultural integration to which we aspire in the unique venture of building Europe."
"Furthermore, libraries make a significant contribution to the depositing, organising, compatibility and transmission of information which, in the age of computer networks, should receive generous financial support from every one of the Member States."
"Of course, the establishment of the telematics networks is still at an early stage, even though some cooperation does exist between national and parliamentary libraries, and between associations of European libraries, as is clear from the Telematics for Libraries programme."
"It is necessary to further develop this cooperation and examine the possibility of different types of library services, so as to find out what opportunities there really are."
"One means of doing this is to promote smaller libraries, which play a special role and have a strong local identity: they are a public meeting-place for users, where a variety of social activities can take place."
"In the fifth framework programme of research and technological development, the Commission should consider establishing a network of European libraries. One of its aims would be to cooperate on a technical level and to conduct targeted research into the manufacturing of permanent paper which does not deteriorate with age, so as to safeguard for the future our present library stocks, so rich in books and archives."
"Finally, a European Centre for Libraries should be established, with well-trained staff, and entrusted with coordinating this sector. An additional benefit here would be the creation of new jobs."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this report on the importance of libraries for the European Union."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she states that libraries represent one of the most important systems which afford access to knowledge and culture."
"The report contains a number of interesting recommendations, some that are complex and, obviously, will cause problems, others that are more straightforward."
"I wholeheartedly support the proposal that Member States incorporate public libraries in their general initiatives concerning the information society."
"We are doing this in Ireland, and the Information Society Commission clearly recognises the value of public libraries."
"The recommendation that the Commission unequivocally takes account of libraries and their role as an information source for members of the public when resolving copyright disputes, may well be opposed by some Member States."
"Also the proposal for a multinational approach to legal deposit may also run into linguistic difficulties."
"However, the call to the Commission to boost its input to the library sector by establishing a focal point to coordinate library affairs and to oversee developments will be universally welcomed."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her report and, certainly, it is an opportune time to discuss it, particularly in advance of the Commission's green paper on this subject."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Ryynänen on her own-initiative report, without adding any ifs or buts."
"The report shows considerable understanding of the technical, economic, cultural and education-related problems with which libraries are faced."
"The role of libraries in organising access to knowledge is becoming more and more important and is particularly worthy of our attention."
"In the face of the fast-growing supply of all types of information there is indeed a great need to link up public libraries in the whole of Europe into a network which is accessible to citizens and which conveys knowledge and culture just like schools or other institutions."
"As the rapporteur has underlined, the Commission has actively encouraged the development of new library services, particularly within the context of the Telematics for Libraries programme."
"It is gratifying to see that many Member States are now, partly as a result of pan-European cooperation, beginning to set up modern, networked library services, which are easily accessible to their users."
"As the rapporteur's analysis shows, libraries are confronted with a very wide range of problems. The fifth framework programme of research should place us in a position where we can support research work into many of the technical issues that were indicated, especially in terms of standards for processing, conserving and transferring information and the creation of links through Community projects."
"Other aspects, for example issues of copyright or universal access, should be placed within a wider context."
"The fact that the Directive on copyright is currently under discussion within several parliamentary committees should for instance contribute to preserving the balance on copyright between the various parties, as called for in the report."
"The report asks the Commission to push ahead with its work on a green paper on the role of libraries in the information society."
"Since March 1997, when the Morgan report was adopted, we have made good progress in identifying and classifying relevant developments in the Member States and in gathering background material on most of the subjects raised."
"The Commission therefore thinks it ought already to draft a communication on the role of libraries, which could serve as a basis for coordinating all the important issues which affect modern library and information services and citizens' access to them."
"The communication would therefore address a number of subjects of specific importance for libraries, such as lifelong learning, copyrights, the promotion of reading, regional information services, and extensive cooperation between public libraries in access to knowledge and culture."
"Also, this communication could give additional impetus to including libraries in the 'User-friendly information society' chapter in the fifth framework programme of research and pave the way for future actions aiming to help citizens of all age groups and all sections of society to make proper use of digital information and services."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"I would congratulate the rapporteur on the fact that her report has been unanimously adopted."
"Mr President, it cannot have been approved unanimously."
"I registered a symbolic abstention."
"Thank you, Mrs Maes."
"I see now that there was not complete unanimity."
"I intended to abstain during the last roll-call vote."
"Perhaps I was late coming in, or maybe my voting machine did not work."
"I should like that to be recorded in the Minutes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no further need to explain abstentions."
"It is sufficient to say that the resolution has been adopted by a broad majority."
"I lay your consciences at rest."
"Mr President, the vote was not unanimous as I voted against the resolution."
"I have corrected my initial euphoria, Mr Striby, and said that the resolution was adopted by a large majority, which takes account of the two abstentions which have been mentioned and your own vote against."
"Sign language"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B4-0489/98) tabled by Mr Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on sign language."
"Mr President, 10 years ago, when Mrs Lemas presented her report on sign language to the House, she had a group of visitors in the gallery who were following our discussion through a sign language interpreter."
"It was very impressive to see this, and it substantiated the demands made in the report and allowed us to experience what they involved."
"I must admit that I myself have not yet learnt sign language, although we Members were offered the opportunity to do so by the European Union of the Deaf."
"That was in connection with a project on sign language, carried out in 1996-97, which culminated in a conference in September 1997 and an extensive report on sign language in the EU."
"This project was, incidentally, financed by the EU within the context of the HELIOS II programme. The result of the project, and the 16 exemplary national reports which were drawn up to provide a complete overview, are proof once again of how important and helpful the HELIOS programme was."
"I would just like to ask the Commission to use its imagination again and find a solution, or legal basis, within the framework of the new Amsterdam Treaty, so that in future useful programmes or projects such as these, which are not concerned with employment, may be supported."
"At the end of the foreword to the report on sign language, it says that the project will need to be followed up if the results are not to be wasted."
"The European Parliament called for sign language to be officially recognised as an independent language 10 years ago."
"There have been some developments in the meantime, and the Commission's financial support for the project is certainly a step forward, but it is not enough."
"As we try to achieve equality for all the Union's citizens, the question arises of whether it is not the job of the Commission to draw up a directive on the official recognition of sign language."
"I no longer accept the term 'subsidiarity' in this context, as unfortunately for a large number of our Member States, it is merely a good pretext for preventing European action and then doing nothing themselves."
"While on the subject, I do see a small ray of hope in my own country, Germany."
"There the situation as regards the recognition of sign language has been and still is extremely difficult."
"In the coalition agreement of the future new German Government though, there is a sentence which says that it will look at how German sign language could be recognised and given equal treatment. Of course, with a directive the Commission could go further than simply undertaking to have a review."
"However, even if sign language were to be recognised and enough interpreters were available everywhere, there would still be a great many problems."
"The easy part would be to ensure that a minimum number of television programmes are broadcast in sign language."
"But we know that television is not the only modern information system."
"In our Member States there are seven different systems for text telephones and these are not compatible."
"The Commission could also do something here by introducing framework legislation."
"It is up to the Commission in any case to ensure that, from the very beginning, multimedia equipment is designed in such a way that the hearing-impaired are not excluded from using them."
"I would like to give the example of mobile telephones to illustrate this point."
"In the USA, thanks to their anti-discrimination act, mobile telephones are compatible with hearing aids."
"But in Europe, devices have been authorised which, when used with a hearing aid, convert it into a jammer."
"Technical barriers have to be avoided, but so do bureaucratic barriers, for example those which prevent the participation of the hearing-impaired in EU programmes."
"Yes, there is financial support to go and learn the language of the exchange country, but there are no funds provided for an interpreter during the exchange, and that applies to sign language interpreters too."
"Such things have to be sorted out."
"This example also shows that a great deal still remains to be done when it comes to bringing down the barriers, not only those that tangibly exist but also those that exist in our heads, and which we have to work on ourselves."
"But we ask the Commission to actively put forward legal frameworks and to break down the bureaucratic barriers in order to make it possible for us all to live together without discrimination, whether we have a disability or not."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is fully aware of the significance of sign language for hearing-impaired people."
"It was emphatic in supporting the Birmingham University research project carried out as part of the follow-up to Parliament's Resolution."
"This study showed that there are considerable differences between Member States as far as the state of development, the availability and the official status of sign language are concerned."
"There is without doubt a lot of room for improvement here, and the Commission will continue to become involved where Community measures can be of additional use."
"However, the Commission's view is that the main responsibility lies with the Member States, and that is why it is not planning any specific proposals on this."
"In the field of education, however, there was for instance the Lingua-Surda project, which was supported within the context of the former Lingua programme."
"Further cooperation projects on general or vocational training for people with special needs may be developed within the framework of the Socrates or Leonardo programmes."
"As regards television programmes, the legal framework that currently applies in the Community has its legal basis above all in the 'Television without Frontiers' Directive, and in Article 57(2) and Article 66 of the EC Treaty, which provide for coordination of the legal and administrative provisions of Member States, to ensure that differences between them do not hinder freedom to provide services."
"Currently though, we have individual state provisions on television programmes in sign language."
"Turning now to the different text telephone systems used in the EU, in fact there are compatibility problems."
"The Commission's view is that the easiest way to remedy this deplorable state of affairs is through agreed standards and it therefore supports the work that is being done on this."
"The European Union of the Deaf has made clear its view that there has to be a uniform standard for text telephones in the whole of the EU."
"Already in 1996 the Commission communication on equality of opportunity for handicapped people had spelled out the advantages of the 'Design for All' idea in connection with multimedia applications."
"The Commission services are currently doing a study on 'Design for All' and on the integration of handicapped and elderly people into the information society, and this includes the accessibility of multimedia applications."
"I am glad today to be able to tell you that on 22 September of this year, the Commission adopted a code of conduct for its own employment of handicapped people."
"The arrangements for the application of this code include, amongst other things, sensitising Commission staff to the problems of the handicapped, and that includes the hearing-impaired."
"Sign language interpreters will be provided on the same basis as other interpreters in order to make meetings accessible to the deaf."
"But it is clear that, because everyone learns their own language, there are going to be as many sign languages as there are spoken languages."
"If we were to request the hearing-impaired to make themselves understood in a single common language, then that would obviously be further discrimination."
"At any rate, the Commission will continue to back a wide range of measures to protect the interests of the deaf, in particular by supporting the European Union of the Deaf."
"Mr President, you can tell how civilised a society is by the way in which it treats its vulnerable members, not its strong ones."
"Like so many others with restricted possibilities, the deaf have a distinct energy, they overcome their limitations and their senses are highly developed."
"They often look more closely and that is why they are in a better position than most to see things properly."
"But participation in technological developments, like text processing devices or videophone technology, and use of multimedia applications and increased communications, have been made more and more difficult for them over the years."
"The European Parliament could lead the way by good example, and for instance have a special monitor up there in the gallery to transmit debates to the deaf or hearing-impaired."
"We can see how alive sign language is when what is being said and done in a television programme is interpreted on a split screen or in a window placed on the screen."
"Though of course this is mostly restricted to information programmes which are banished to the afternoons, when not many people are watching."
"What does the Commission think of a quota system with a significantly higher volume of programmes, and how could this be implemented in Member States, Commissioner Fischler?"
"People who cannot hear are not speechless as a result of this."
"That is why the Group of the European People's Party appeals to the Commission to fully recognise sign language as an EU language and to prepare a proposal for a directive along these lines."
"The Commissioner has just pointed to some of the difficulties, for instance the different sign languages that have to be considered."
"I am very well aware of this but I think that to start with one language would be the most sensible approach that we can take."
"That would definitely also contribute to more equality."
"And it would also clear the way for us to train more skilled interpreters in sign language and to provide adequate EU funding."
"Then we could prove once again that there is a European added value, and minorities, as we call them, must of course also benefit from it."
"Mr President, we are told that sign language - the language of those with hearing difficulties - does not enjoy official recognition in some Member States. The logical conclusion to draw is that people do not see any reason for the deaf to have their own language."
"And that does in fact appear to be the case in some places. Yet it is not enough simply to acknowledge the need for sign language."
"That language has to be used in everyday life to a much greater extent than is the case today."
"Those with hearing impairments must be given a chance to take part in public debate. This means both providing them with information on what is happening and ensuring that they can truly participate in an up-to-date way."
"The first step is to increase the numbers of trained sign-language teachers and interpreters."
"The news is now interpreted into sign language in Sweden, as is live TV coverage of important debates in the Riksdag."
"This is excellent, of course, but there is scope for many more programmes with signing."
"Television companies should be expected as a matter of course to offer sign-language interpretation of political debates and news broadcasts."
"Such a requirement should, I believe, be included in TV companies' licence agreements."
"The most valuable contribution the Commission can make is to offer the Member States support and urge them to act. The main responsibility does, after all, lie with them."
"We can of course also do a good deal in the European Parliament. With a little help and encouragement from the Commission, let us hope that more Member States will recognise sign language, promote the use of signing during TV programmes and televised debates, and train more teachers and interpreters."
"Perhaps we might set them an example here in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, on behalf of our group I should like to express our support for the various issues that Mrs Schmidbauer raised at the beginning of this debate."
"I listened to the Commissioner very carefully, and I think we can agree that the main responsibility does indeed lie with the Member States."
"Nevertheless, as you yourself said, Commissioner, there are a number of measures that could be taken in the field of coordination, harmonisation and in particular the alignment of text telephone systems."
"I think it would be extremely useful if you were to implement these practical measures."
"I feel, however, that the Commission too should consider giving symbolic recognition to the Union's sign languages so that the deaf do not feel discriminated against here in the House, and so that the necessary measures can be taken to ensure that they can communicate with Parliament in their own language."
"For too long now, sign language has not been given proper recognition, and now that the situation is changing we must be quick to ensure that it is officially recognised and applied in practice."
"Thank you, Mrs Maes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 18 November."
"Late payment by the Commission"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B4-0490/98) tabled by Mr Pex, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on damage caused by the Commission as a result of late payment."
"Mr President, the fact that I am asking this question in the Chamber today may be rather surprising, because as committee chairman I am naturally in regular contact with the Commission and often have the flexibility to deal with all sorts of things myself."
"But there are now so many organisations that are having problems that I thought it best to bring the matter out into the open."
"In my view, the purpose of granting subsidies is to enable work to be carried out that we regard as desirable, not to keep a number of civil servants busy all year until they finally grant the subsidies as an act of generosity."
"It is the duty of the authorities to provide and maintain legal certainty."
"This means that any subsidies granted must be notified in good time after the application has been received, and payment must be made as quickly as possible after notification."
"Let me give you two examples."
"The first was a small project in the United Kingdom in 1997."
"ECU 15 000 was finally paid out in December 1997 after I myself had intervened."
"The people concerned were not able to carry out the project because they had no money to pay for it."
"The second example is an organisation with a number of staff which has been receiving subsidies for several years."
"The sum in question here was ECU 500 000."
"On 30 July this year, they received a letter telling them that they would be receiving a subsidy - on 30 July, when half the year was already over in which they had had to support themselves."
"The first instalment was paid at the end of August, again after I had intervened, and the second was paid very soon afterwards."
"The interest charges for this second project came to ECU 24 000."
"I could give you dozens of other examples, but I will not mention any names, because companies beg me not to do so in case it harms their position in future."
"I think it is important that if people are forced to borrow money to fund activities because they trust the Commission to honour its promises, they have to be sure about their situation."
"If they have to pay interest, which we hope is not the case, then they have to know that they can recover it."
"This year the situation is even more serious than in previous years, because after the Court of Justice ruling, the decision was taken not to make any further payments at all."
"Just imagine what happens."
"An organisation goes to a bank with a letter signed by the European Commission and is granted a loan on the basis of that letter."
"After a few months, the bank starts to become nervous."
"It asks the Commission what is going on, and the Commission says it is making no further payments."
"Organisations are getting themselves into enormous difficulties, not just in terms of liquidity but also with their banks."
"According to what I have been told, a number of organisations have had to stop work because of this."
"I think this is absolutely scandalous, and I would therefore, in short, ask the Commission to guarantee Parliament two things in the 1999 budget, in other words for next year: firstly, that the budget promises will be honoured in the first quarter and, secondly, that payments will be made immediately afterwards, so that projects can start on time."
"The budget lines are fixed here in Parliament."
"The organisations concerned know about them as soon as the second reading is over, they submit their applications by the end of the year and expect to be able to start work very quickly."
"We are the ones who commission all these individuals, private organisations and sometimes businesses to do this work, because we want them to implement our policy for us."
"It is too ridiculous for words that we do this in a way which makes it impossible to guarantee that our plans can actually be implemented in the budget year for which they were intended."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the payment of subsidies for measures in the cultural field that Mr Pex raised in his oral question did indeed have to be deferred until September."
"The Commission had already published a call for proposals in January, with a view to granting these subsidies."
"However, because of the judgment on the legal bases from the European Court of Justice in May, the Commission was forced to suspend the procedure."
"For the budget line concerned, created by the European Parliament, the requisite legal basis had not been enacted and this was confirmed at the trilogue meeting in the middle of July."
"The trilogue decided that the Commission could pay out the appropriations to recipients selected before the judgment was pronounced, on the basis of legitimate expectations."
"Because the call for proposals was issued before the beginning of the year, the Commission was therefore able to grant these subsidies."
"We fully realise that the organisations concerned were in difficulties as a result of the funds being blocked."
"The payments though were made as agreed within 60 days of the contracts being signed."
"Compensation was not therefore deemed to be justified, and no money has been set aside for it in any case."
"This problem will no longer arise in the coming year, because we hope this type of blockage of funds will not occur again."
"At the trilogue, it was clearly established under which conditions budget lines can be implemented without a legal basis, and we are going to respect these."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I welcome the decision reached by the European Court of Justice and the Commission."
"Since the earliest days of European integration, the European Court of Justice has always played an important role."
"It has protected Community law and developed it further."
"It has made many far-reaching decisions."
"On 12 May, the European Court of Justice decided on the basis of complaints from several Member States, especially the UK, and I think this is worthy of note, that two things are required to release funds from the EU budget: the first is financing with commitment and payment appropriations, and the second is an adequate legal base."
"As a result, the Commission stopped all payments that did not correspond to these criteria, and I think it was absolutely right to do so."
"The Commission blocked 100 budget lines, in the region of 920 million euros, in order to examine their legal bases."
"56 lines, that is EUR 390 million, were fully released, 19 lines, or EUR 170 m, were partly released, and some 16 lines, or EUR 340 m, were in the pipeline, that is to say they had been approved by Parliament."
"NGO projects in the areas of family, children, the elderly and especially culture were particularly affected."
"My congratulations go to the Austrian Council Presidency first of all, and also to the Commission, under whose chairmanship, on 17 July of this year, we managed to reach interinstitutional agreement, release the funds and arrive at a workable decision on the legal bases."
"Let us not forget though that the European Parliament, and the Committee on Budgets in particular, has been calling for such a regulation for the past 16 years."
"Considering that for 16 years we have concerned ourselves with this essential demand, and now within a few days it is ready to be implemented, you can see how much of a contribution the Court's decision has made to placing the arrangements - and ultimately also the decisions - between the institutions on the appropriate legal basis."
"After the publication of the judgment and until the compromise was reached, the Commission's position was certainly not a simple one."
"Many of the budget lines affected programmes already mentioned, in the fields of culture, education, youth and family."
"We in Parliament received many pleas from organisations affected, which of course could no longer be certain that they would receive the money on time."
"Therefore, and particularly after today, I am happy to be able to say that most of the appropriations have now been released again."
"But the Commission cannot be alone in bearing the consequences of its conduct."
"After all, it was only following EU law in complying with a judgment from the highest court in the Union."
"And as the Commissioner has just explained to us, the payments were made within 60 days."
"I am also of the opinion that the discussion on this, and the quick solution, represent clear progress for the EU."
"In parallel to this, there is also a directive on late payment, which deals with the payment period, and I think that will also be good for the Union."
"We should not just be an example when it comes to bringing money in, where we are very quick to take action in the form of legal sanctions and harsh instruments, but as the EU we should also be exemplary when it comes to paying out."
"We should be a reliable partner and an example for Europe."
"Mr President, as president of the Friends of Music in the European Parliament I regularly get requests, urgent telephone calls and pleas from organisations in the musical field who are waiting for their payments from the Commission."
"The European Court of Justice case made it worse this year but I have to say that in my 4 ½ years experience in this Parliament it has been the same every year with the Commission."
"Every year we take the decisions in November, in the budget, as to which organisations should get funding, and every year the Commission delivers the money to them if they are lucky by October of the following year."
"This is a totally unacceptable delay in terms of delivery of money."
"The solution seems to be that we need more multiannual programmes - which I hope the new cultural framework programme will actually establish - so that major organisations like the European Youth Orchestra, the European Opera Centre and so on will actually be getting their money on a staged payment basis, with monitoring and evaluation by the Commission and proper auditing and all those things, but in a reliable and regular way that they can count on."
"If delays are incurred because of the Commission's fault then we should demand that the Commission pay the interest payments that they have to pay to the banks because of the delay."
"I can see Commissioner Fischler is laughing there and I assume that is a positive response."
"Mr President, in some respects, what we are dealing with here is a moral rule of procedure."
"I would like to give the example of a case on which I do not think a decision has been made by the European Court of Justice, and where payment has been delayed by about a year now."
"Voluntary workers wanted to build a school for homeless children in Chile."
"They obtained a legally binding commitment but they have been waiting for the money for a year now."
"Luckily they were able to get some interim financing."
"All this is surely bad enough in itself, but what is even worse, and a sign furthermore of the arrogance and slowness in the Commission, is that all the letters asking for an explanation have either remained unanswered or have been answered without giving any answers."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, to pass this matter on to the competent services, otherwise I shall report it to the European Ombudsman."
"This is no way to treat European citizens!"
"Mr Rehder, that was not a point of order; it was a statement."
"I would be grateful if, in future, you could ensure that you are included on the list of speakers."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Adjournment of the session"
"Parliament has now come to the end of its agenda."
"The Minutes of today's sitting will be submitted to Parliament for its approval at the beginning of its next sitting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before ending, may I express my thanks as usual to all of Parliament's services."
"This week has had some tense and intense moments, which is inevitable when debating and adopting budgets. And, it must be said, everything has run very smoothly thanks to the efficiency of Parliament's services, thanks to the quality of the rapporteurs and, it might also be said, thanks to Mrs Fontaine's enviable ability to conduct the voting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this week began with the sign of peace."
"The first words of our President, Mr Gil-Robles, were to honour the fitting award of the Nobel Prize to two of the greatest leaders of the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"And we end, likewise, with the sign of peace, because these Friday morning sittings are extraordinarily peaceful, so much so that, when the time comes round again to nominate candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, I am tempted to nominate the Friday morning sittings as a candidate."
"I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that I am successful."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.15 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 23 October 1998."
"Statement by the President"
"I have to inform the House that since the closure of the last part-session, I have sent a number of telegrams on its behalf, expressing solidarity and conveying condolences from all the Members of the House - and I am sure I acted for all of them. First, to the Prime Minister of Sweden and to the Speaker of the Swedish Parliament, following the horrific tragedy in Gothenburg."
"As soon as the news broke, I sent messages to Sweden, expressing our solidarity and also our sorrow and horror at what had happened."
"Sadly, just a few days later, I found myself sending another set of messages, this time to the governments of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Once again, I expressed Parliament's deep regret and the sadness felt by all its Members."
"I should mention that authorisation has been given for a meeting of our Parliament's Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico to be held this very afternoon. The delegation will meet the ambassadors from the four countries concerned and the Commission, to discuss the best way of helping these devastated countries."
"Welcome"
"I now wish to welcome the members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly to our Parliament."
"They are present in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery and with them is the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, David Trimble."
"In the same way that the other day we were able to congratulate and show our support for our colleague John Hume we take the opportunity today to offer our congratulations to this man."
"(The House rose and accorded Mr Trimble a standing ovation) We wish the members of the new assembly a fruitful visit to Brussels and every success in the months and years ahead."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 23 October 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, regarding the matter of televising Friday morning sittings, can you tell me whether they will be televised from now on?"
"We will deal with this matter in the Bureau but we have had to organize extraordinary meetings of the Bureau to cope with a very long agenda."
"I hope it will be dealt with very soon."
"Mr President, on page 1 of the Minutes of the Friday of the last part-session, I predicted that the British would let General Pinochet go free."
"Perhaps when you are sending your telegrams you can send one to the British saying they should send him to Spain where I believe there are many good prisons which would be happy to accommodate him."
"The Parliament has had an opportunity to debate this question and has made its views clear."
"Mr President, I want to refer to the change made to the agenda, with the introduction of Mr Skinner's report on the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a mechanism for the Commission to intervene and abolish certain obstacles to trade."
"My question is: why are we dealing with that subject now, when it was originally scheduled for the second November part-session, and what is the reason for an urgent procedure?"
"We ask that it be postponed, given that the text of the Council's agreement is not available in all the languages - at least, I could not find it in my own - and that because of this urgent procedure there is not even time to table amendments."
"Mr Theonas, the Skinner report was added because we have not received from the Council the common positions which we were expecting today. So, to make best use of the short time remaining before the end of the parliamentary term, the Skinner report has been included because it was ready."
"I give the floor to Mrs Pailler."
"Mr President, in March 1997 you sent a letter to the Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, about the death sentence passed on Mumia Abu-Jamal and his planned execution."
"I would now ask you to write another letter of protest to Mr Ridge who promised during his election campaign that the execution of Abu-Jamal would go ahead."
"Abu-Jamal has just lost his appeal and may be executed any day now, possibly even as we speak."
"Could you also please write to the US Ambassador to the European Union?"
"I believe that Parliament, which has passed many resolutions on the death penalty and specifically on Abu-Jamal, must continue to show its support and desire for the protection of human rights, in particular to ensure that proceedings are correctly instituted, which has not been the case with Abu-Jamal, and that the death penalty is finally abolished."
"Thank you, Mrs Pailler, I will write the letters as you request."
"Mr President, I have here today as my guest, and as the guest of many Members, the Dairy Trade Coalition from the United States of America."
"Despite the fact that I had passes for them to go into the visitors' gallery, they have been prevented from doing so."
"Along with your welcome to the new Northern Ireland Assembly Members, I wanted you to welcome them also."
"However, they have been prevented from entering the gallery which is scandalous considering that I made the necessary arrangements."
"I do not understand what has happened."
"Mr Killilea, our Parliament is so much appreciated that now the Official Gallery is full."
"It is simply a matter of lack of space."
"But I am sure we welcome them as we do any other visitors."
"Mr President, Last week the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy sent you an urgent letter asking if we could have a statement here today from Mr Santer on what grants are to be made under the budget lines for human rights."
"It was a unanimous and urgent request from the whole of the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"Can you tell me what has happened to that request?"
"Clearly it is not on today's agenda."
"Can you explain?"
"Mrs Aelvoet, that letter did indeed reach me yesterday, and it was immediately forwarded to the European Commission, because in the letter, the Committee on Foreign Affairs asked for the Commission to be invited to make a statement pursuant to Rule 37 of our Rules of Procedure. You know better than I do that it is for the Commission to decide to invoke Rule 37."
"We cannot require it to do so."
"The invitation was only extended yesterday and, so far, the Commission has not responded."
"If and when the Commission indicates that it is willing to make such a statement, we shall endeavour to add it to the agenda."
"In fact, that is not the worst thing."
"The worst thing is that it appears that the European Commission has not yet concluded its debate and resolution on enlargement, and we are expecting Commissioner van den Broek to arrive at any minute bearing the latest information."
"Clearly, if no decision has been taken he will have nothing to tell us."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I understood, and so did my colleagues from Northern Ireland, that we would have an opportunity to thank you for your welcome to the folks from Northern Ireland and especially the members of the new assembly."
"I am sure that people in this House have firm opinions on this matter."
"However, I would suggest to this House today that, as the people of Northern Ireland see some 200 convicted terrorists released on the streets, without any effort on the part of the terrorists to hand in their weapons, it as a democratic parliament would want to lend its voice in support of those who want to support the democratic way, and urge them to do it democratically, hand in their weapons and rid us of the plague of terrorism on both sides of the divide."
"Mr President, all I would like to say is to express my deep appreciation to you and to the Members of this House for the welcome they have given today to the members of the Northern Ireland Assembly."
"It is the first time in history that the entire membership of an assembly from any region in Europe has come here during our part-session and that underlines the strength of the feeling of appreciation in Northern Ireland for the support that our agreement and the peace process has received from the European Union and especially from this Parliament, and in particular the special Programme of Peace and Reconciliation."
"The attendance of our assembly here today is a clear expression of that appreciation and their wish to ensure that they are fully informed as to the workings of the European Union so that they can make the best advantage of it when they take up office."
"In relation to the matters raised by Mr Paisley: those are dealt with adequately in the agreement and the task of us all is to implement all aspects of that agreement and for all parties to do it together."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, very briefly I would like to add my welcome to the members of the Northern Ireland Assembly to our Parliament today, including my leader David Trimble."
"All of us here remember that on many occasions down the years we have stood in this House and condemned the violence."
"We have to hope that we never have to do that again."
"But the House should be aware that we have some way to go to achieve our ultimate aim of total peace and a normal society in Northern Ireland."
"We must look forward and not back."
"The members of this assembly bear the responsibility of bringing a new future to all the people of Northern Ireland."
"Mr President, I have a query about the Minutes which I believe we are still discussing, although I did ask to speak some time ago."
"I made a speech on Friday 23 October which was incorrectly reported on page 10 of the Minutes."
"I did not request a vote en bloc on the remaining amendments, but rather on the amendments whose aim was identical to that of the amendments which had just been adopted."
"My remarks are therefore not correctly reported in the Minutes and I would not like there to be any ambiguity."
"I am also astonished that this speech does not appear in the so-called 'verbatim' report, given that the verbatim report should be the complete version of events."
"The Minutes are clearly not a verbatim record, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, but if you think that your remarks have not been accurately reflected, I would ask you to let us have the precise text of what you said in writing and it will be corrected in the Minutes."
"Mr President, I wish to speak on the agenda but before doing so would like to add my voice to those who have welcomed the members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly here today and to tell them that we have always endorsed the new agreement in the North."
"None of us want to see any more death or grief in any region of the European Union, in particular there where the situation has been so tragic for so long."
"I rose to ask you to inform me further - as you have already done in writing - about an issue I raised some time back."
"It concerns the UK Charities Commissioner, in particular the Director of the Neurofibromatosis Association, and her information to this Parliament, for which she was later censured."
"I have not received an answer."
"We have been in correspondence but I am raising the matter because I do not feel that I or this Parliament have received a proper answer."
"It is a matter of the privilege of this House."
"Mrs Ahern, I will check that and write to you again"
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to remind you that, on behalf of my group, I tabled an oral question on the visit by the Veterinary Committee to Portugal because I should like to be told of the findings of that visit."
"We already know that an embargo has been introduced but I would like to remind the House of something with reference to the Rules of Procedure."
"An extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture was convened for the sole purpose of voting on Mr Görlach's report on rural development, although it was not on the agenda but was the result of a gentlemen's agreement - if indeed there are still any gentlemen in this Parliament."
"Yet the Commission took that opportunity to hear Dr Joachim Heine on the matter of BSE in Portugal, even though no Portuguese Member of Parliament was present."
"The underhand, clandestine and cowardly way in which the Commission often acts - even when it is right - is a disgrace."
"I am not saying that the Commission was not right to do this."
"But it is not enough to be right; you have to know how to be right and the Commission does not know. That is what I regret so deeply."
"I am calling on the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, who is indeed a gentlemen and behaved as one, to do whatever is necessary to recall Dr Heine so that we can hear what our German colleagues have said about Portugal, whether or not they are right."
"They should hold their tongues and show a little more common sense!"
"Thank you, Mr Rosado."
"We shall investigate what has happened in the Committee on Agriculture."
"Mr President, with the presence of the delegates from the Northern Ireland Assembly Parliament has again welcomed the agreement with a standing ovation of several minutes, and I wish to say that we too share in this celebration, as we did last time."
"I asked to speak, however, in order to say that we have drawn a conclusion which I think could be the European Parliament's conclusion too."
"What has been happening for decades in Northern Ireland is not exactly the same as what is happening in Kosovo, though there are important similarities."
"And, Mr President, in Ireland there was no need either for unilateral military intervention by America or by NATO."
"We reached a national..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Ephremidis, this is not a debate on Kosovo, and we are not going to debate Kosovo just because a number of guests from Ireland are present."
"I should like to express my appreciation to the President for his opening address and to all those who sent messages of condolence to my home town, Gothenburg, where 63 young people died recently in a fire."
"I am sure that the messages brought great comfort, and now our thoughts should be with the survivors, both the young people who still live near the scene of the fire and their parents."
"Mr President, I would like to return to the agenda and in particular to what Mr Theonas said."
"This is in connection with Mr Skinner's report."
"In Parliament we have the new technologies of e-mail and all the other communication systems available, but nevertheless, we did not get any advance information that Mr Skinner's report would be discussed."
"This really is a matter of principle."
"We should know in advance what matters are to be discussed, so that we can table any necessary amendments."
"I do not think it is right that we should find out on the same day that we come to the Chamber."
"The groups were already aware of this, Mrs Ojala, but their Secretaries-General initiated the change."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"The Commission representative is not yet present."
"I shall ask the Commission's officials when Commissioner van den Broek is expected."
"I am informed that the meeting has finished and that Commissioner van den Broek is on his way to Parliament by car."
"I shall therefore suspend the sitting for five minutes. We shall resume in five minutes' time with Mr van den Broek's statement and the debate."
"I am sorry that the Commission has acted in this way and put us in such a position."
"(The sitting was suspended for five minutes)"
"Mr President, as the Commissioner was late in arriving does that mean that our hour of questions begins from when he stands up?"
"We will have three quarters of an hour because it will be followed by a statement by President Santer."
"Enlargement"
"The next item is the Commission communication on progress reports on the countries which have applied for accession."
"I give the floor to Mr van den Broek."
"I trust that he will provide an explanation for the Commission's attitude and for this totally inexcusable delay."
"Out of respect for the House, I think he is duty bound to apologise and give us an explanation."
"Mr President, obviously I apologise for this delay and ask for your understanding."
"I rushed out of the Commission after we had concluded our discussion of the twelve regular reports we have to send to Parliament and the Council."
"This means that the results of this discussion in the Commission this morning are still being elaborated into the final text of the report which I do not have with me for that particular reason."
"You will also be aware that President Santer returned from his visit to China only this morning which is why the Commission started its meeting one hour later than normal."
"But I hope that after I have made my statement on the regular reports, there will be some understanding of the intensity and the scope we have tried to cover in these regular reports."
"It is almost 18 months after the opinions on the candidate countries and 9 months after the formal launch of the EU enlargement process in London that the Commission has today adopted its first regular reports on each of these 12 candidates' progress towards EU membership as well as a composite paper that accompanies these reports and summarises them."
"These reports will provide the basis for the discussions on enlargement at the Vienna European Council in mid-December."
"I hope they will reach you as soon as possible."
"Compiling these reports has been a huge task."
"Last year's opinions were recognized as high-quality work and I am convinced that in today's reports we have taken our analysis to an even higher plane."
"Commission officials have gained more experience."
"We have worked with the candidates more intensely."
"We know more and we understand better."
"As last year, the Commission would not have been able to produce this work without information and advice from the candidates themselves, Member States and international organizations."
"The European Parliament, and in particular its many rapporteurs, have also made a professional and valuable contribution to the EU's work on enlargement."
"Our assessment has been conducted on the basis of the same Copenhagen criteria as the opinions last year."
"The goalposts have not been shifted."
"The work of our officials was expert, objective, impartial and free of political prejudice."
"The reports look in detail at actual progress in the candidate countries, namely on the laws passed, on policy decisions implemented and on institutions created, rather than at intentions or promises."
"This was the only way to be fair, and to be seen to be fair, to all countries."
"We are well aware that all the candidates have much new legislation in the pipeline and once adopted and implemented they will be highlighted in forthcoming regular reports."
"The reports show that much has been achieved but that there is also still a huge task for the candidate countries in preparing themselves for EU membership."
"In the reports we do not gloss over the challenges they face."
"We would be doing nobody - and least of all the candidates themselves - a service if we did."
"Yet our assessment reveals that the inclusive enlargement process which involves all candidates remains broadly on track and that the momentum toward enlargement in the candidate countries is being maintained."
"Our assessment does not lead us to propose the extension of negotiations to any further candidates this year."
"In the case of Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia we conclude that the rate of progress has been sufficient to hold out the possibility of a positive recommendation regarding the opening of negotiations at the end of 1999 for Latvia."
"For Lithuania and Slovakia we also hope to be able to recommend the opening of negotiations within a reasonable period."
"This approach provides a clear political recognition of the progress that Latvia and to a somewhat lesser extent Lithuania have made to prepare for membership over the past 18 months."
"In the case of Slovakia it provides necessary encouragement to the newly-elected government, as it seeks to put in place the policies and laws that will bring it closer to the European Union."
"I shall discuss in more detail the reasons for highlighting these three countries in a moment."
"In addition to the conclusions concerning Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, we issue a stern reminder to the negotiating countries and in particular to the Czech Republic and Slovenia that they need to speed up their adoption and implementation of the acquis ."
"The slowdown we have observed since the opinions is a cause for concern."
"It needs to be very clear that delays in transposition or implementation of the acquis cannot simply be resolved by transitional periods."
"We also provide for the first time a comprehensive insight into each candidate's administrative capacity to apply the acquis ."
"This is an area where all the candidates will have to strengthen their reforms."
"Another recommendation of a somewhat different nature is that the Council of Ministers should reconfirm its commitment to the aims and format of the European Conference as set out in the Luxembourg European Council conclusions."
"This Conference was designed to provide the over-arching structure of the enlargement process, notably for second and third pillar issues."
"We feel it should not be weakened by opening it up at present to a wider membership."
"I should now like to provide a brief overview of the main findings of the regular reports."
"I shall refrain from providing a detailed description of each country's progress and each particular sector."
"That can be found in the individual country reports themselves which I hope will be available this afternoon."
"In the case of all ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe, I shall briefly set out our assessment on the political criterion, the economic criteria, both of which are conditions for starting negotiations and on the adoption of the acquis , as well as each candidate's administrative capacity."
"I will then make a few remarks on Cyprus, Turkey and Malta."
"I begin with the Copenhagen political criterion which focuses on the stability of institutions, guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities."
"In last year's opinions the Commission concluded that all the candidate countries, except Slovakia, broadly met the political criterion for membership."
"I will come back to Slovakia in a moment."
"In this year's regular reports the Commission has again looked beyond the letter of the law and analysed the way democracy functions in practice."
"Our overall conclusion is that the situation is encouraging as the candidates are continuing to consolidate their political stability."
"Six of the Central European candidates - Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia - have held free and fair parliamentary or presidential elections in the past 12 months."
"In Latvia the situation of non-citizens was given an important boost with the positive result in the referendum on the citizenship law."
"It will ease the way for the naturalisation of mostly Russian-speaking non-citizens and stateless children."
"In a number of specific instances shortcomings that the Commission highlighted in the opinions last year have not yet been adequately addressed."
"In most of the candidate countries, for example, the judiciary still needs to be strengthened significantly and in some cases its independence needs to be reinforced."
"Regarding respect for minority rights and other political criteria, the situation of the Roma in the candidate countries continues to be a cause of concern."
"Slovakia deserves a special mention."
"The Commission's assessment last year was that of all the candidates only Slovakia clearly failed to fulfil the Copenhagen political criterion."
"Today's regular report covers developments since mid-1997, a period in which little happened to make us revise that assessment."
"However, following last month's general election, a new government has been formed and a new impetus for political and economic reform is tangible."
"This new situation also allows for the prospect of opening negotiations on condition that the regular, stable and democratic functioning of institutions is confirmed."
"It will also be necessary before opening negotiations to verify that Slovakia has undertaken measures to correct the economic situation and has introduced greater transparency in its operation."
"Those elements received less attention last year because the political arguments against the opening of negotiations were so overriding, but the economic elements were also mentioned in the report."
"As far as the economic criteria of Copenhagen are concerned, these focus on two particular issues."
"Firstly, the existence of a functioning market economy; secondly, the capacity to withstand competitive pressure and market forces within the Union."
"For a candidate to pass the economic test, it needs to be a functioning market economy now and to be able to cope with competitive pressures in the medium term."
"Overall, the candidate countries continued to make considerable progress in implementing economic reforms."
"Elements such as privatisation, restructuring and liberalisation are clearly moving ahead in most cases and although the situation in all the candidate countries varies considerably, we believe that it is largely due to historical reasons."
"Our analysis reveals that, as in the opinions last year, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia can be regarded as functioning market economies and they should be able to fulfil the second, the competitiveness criterion, in the medium term."
"Hungary and Poland continue to be somewhat ahead of the others in this respect."
"Mr President, obviously I am prepared to return to Parliament to elaborate further."
"Allow me to say a few words on the economic criteria and the acquis."
"I shall try to do this as briefly as possible."
"Lithuania, for its part, has also made considerable progress."
"I mentioned Latvia and Slovakia earlier."
"However, additional measures are needed and some recent decisions need to be tested in practice before it can be considered to have met the Copenhagen criteria."
"That said, we would also like to see the perspective opened for a positive recommendation."
"As far as the adoption of the acquis is concerned, I repeat that there are a number of countries that are negotiating but which tend to neglect adoption of the acquis ."
"We have to make clear to these countries that negotiations as such cannot replace or be a substitute for adoption of the acquis ."
"On administrative capacity I will be brief."
"Clearly one has to strengthen the administrative capacity and the judiciary in order not only to adopt but also to implement the acquis ."
"On Cyprus I can be very brief."
"The negotiations are on track and continuing and we still hope that the situation will allow the Turkish Cypriots to participate in these negotiations."
"All the screening that has taken place now obviously only relates to the southern part of Cyprus."
"On Turkey we have also made a regular report and for the first time also included the measurement against the Copenhagen criteria."
"It will not be a big surprise that although there are a number of positive comments to be made on the economic side, on the political side a lot remains to be desired, notably the functioning of the political system, the role of the military, the question of the protection of human rights and other issues which are well known to the Parliament from the reports we have made earlier."
"On Malta we will come forward with our report probably by the middle of February, updating the conclusions of 1993, taking into account two years of interruption of the enlargement process for Malta because of the change of government."
"This has been a brief overview of some 600 pages of thorough analysis."
"They are summarized in the composite paper."
"Finally, I thank the European Parliament once again for its own contribution and I look forward to continuing our discussion on the regular reports in the coming months."
"Mr President, Commissioner van den Broek just said, with reference to the progress made by Lithuania, that this progress must not, however, take the place of negotiations."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can come back to this and explain exactly what he meant."
"When we talk about the six that are negotiating, it is rather striking that a number of them have considerably slowed down the process of adoption of the acquis ."
"The reasons behind this can only be guessed at but we thought that the report should also be used to signal clearly - and I mentioned the Czech Republic and Slovenia in particular - that negotiations cannot replace the work that has to be done to take over legislation etc."
"That was the main message here."
"One may not draw the conclusion that would be a reason to move other countries which are not yet negotiating, but that do meet the criteria, to the negotiating circle."
"We thought it was necessary that where we laud and commend improvement and progress, we also should be critical where some performances are lagging behind."
"Mr President, I was pleased to hear the Commissioner's glowing account of Latvia's swift and steady progress, and I assume that full membership within the agreed time can now be negotiated."
"I hope that Lithuania and Slovakia will now be subject to the same conditions."
"I should like to know why the Commission did not mention in the summary it is preparing that Estonia had abolished capital punishment?"
"Parliament has made it quite plain that countries which retain the death penalty cannot become members of the European Union."
"I wonder whether the Commission has been forceful enough in conveying this message to countries that are negotiating membership, but where this grotesque sanction is still in force?"
"It is obvious that we are not speaking yet about membership."
"We are talking about the preparation and process."
"We are talking about the distinction between the preparation on negotiations of five countries and the actual negotiating by six countries."
"It is obvious that at the present point in time none of the candidate countries entirely fulfil the criteria for membership."
"That is why the preparation in general has to continue."
"The measurement of that will be done year by year in the regular reports on the basis of the progress made by each and every individual candidate country."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"There is something wrong with the procedures in this House when, on this issue, which is the major political issue facing the European Union, the Commissioner was cut off when giving his report."
"I understand your need to keep to the agenda and your need to get through the business, but perhaps we could have asked Mr Santer to present his report at a later time and taken this item in full."
"We were all irritated that the Commissioner was not here but, by the same token, we all welcome the fact that he has come straight from the Commission meeting."
"It would serve this House and the seriousness with which we want to be taken much better if we had a proper debate on this and let the Commissioner finish his report."
"I am very sorry that we did not do so."
"Mr President, I think that Parliament and this debate would be better served if we had the full text of the Commissioner's report."
"So I echo Mrs Green in asking for the Commissioner's full report to be made available to us so that he can have a proper chance to debate his report with us."
"It was the Commission which said that it would present its report today."
"The Commission knows it has ten minutes."
"The Commissioner spoke, in fact, for 14 minutes."
"The longer he speaks, the less time he has to answer Members' questions."
"I cannot perform miracles but I can make a choice between letting him make a long speech or answering the many questions Members may have."
"I have to try to make the best choice."
"I understand your point of view very well but if we followed your line we could have 20-minute statements with no time to answer questions."
"And answering questions is important."
"Mr President, let me do Mrs Green and our President too something of a favour."
"Coming up shortly is the Commission programme which Mr Santer will present to us."
"I have to tell you that we have no documents about it at all."
"Would it not be a good idea to continue the debate on enlargement and say to Mr Santer: just give us the paper or the letters we need."
"You have to give us the texts."
"So I am grateful to Mrs Green - give us the texts and we will postpone the debate."
"I think that is a far better idea."
"I have no programme."
"It is not me who makes the agenda."
"You have just approved the agenda with these changes."
"If you want the House to remove Mr Santer's statement from the agenda to create more time, I will put it to the vote."
"(The House accepted the proposal to remove Mr Santer's statement from the agenda)"
"Mr President, I am glad that we now can have a full debate on this important subject."
"I noted very carefully the words of the Commissioner in relation to Slovakia - and I speak as the second vice-president of the joint parliamentary committee."
"He used the words 'within a reasonable period we would open negotiations'."
"In referring to Latvia, he said 'at the end of 1999'."
"Are we to interpret 'within a reasonable period' to be before the end of 1999 or after?"
"Can he not be more precise in the best interests of our relations with Slovakia?"
"With due respect, we will not make our recommendations for opening of negotiations in order to maintain good political relations because they were not the Copenhagen criteria."
"As I said, we will judge on the individual merits of each and every country regarding the political criteria, which was at stake with Slovakia, and the economic criteria - both the market economy requirement and the competitiveness requirement."
"Regarding the periods we have put in the conclusions of the composite paper, some elaboration may be required when you have had an opportunity to read the document."
"We are saying that with regard to a future extension of negotiations, the Commission wishes to highlight the particular progress made by Latvia."
"If the momentum of change is maintained it should be possible next year to confirm that Latvia meets the Copenhagen economic criteria and before the end of 1999 to propose the opening of negotiations."
"It must be well understood that this is not a blank cheque."
"Verification will take place during the course of next year as to whether the momentum of change in Latvia that we have broadly described in the report is being maintained."
"On Lithuania we are saying that considerable progress has also been made."
"However, additional measures are needed and some recent decisions by that country need to be tested in practice before it can be considered to have met the Copenhagen economic criteria which would allow the Commission to propose the opening of negotiations."
"So we are mentioning the negotiations, putting that into a clear perspective and have described in the individual report what further measures need to be taken to have this prospect realised."
"Finally, on Slovakia, the new situation created following the election also allows for the prospect of opening negotiations on condition that the regular stable and democratic functioning of its institutions are confirmed."
"This will need to be verified."
"It will also be necessary before opening negotiations to verify that Slovakia has undertaken measures to correct the economic situation and that it has introduced greater transparency in its operation."
"Why do we say that?"
"It is because under the previous government one could say that the legislative part of a market economic system was in place but that there was heavy state intervention and a lack of transparency, notably in the way the privatisation process was being carried out."
"This new government has already made known that it wants to change that but the effects must be verified before we are able, on the basis of the objective Copenhagen criteria, to recommend the opening of negotiations."
"We clearly put this into perspective and the political signal from this conclusion cannot be misunderstood."
"Mr President, I listened very carefully to what Mr van den Broek had to say."
"First of all, I am confused about the ranking he applied."
"I knew that there was a group of six countries applying for accession, with priority for the countries of central and eastern Europe and for Cyprus."
"Mr van den Broek presented us with a different ranking, and that is important: the five central and eastern European countries, certain other central and eastern European countries, and then a grey area which, in one and the same group, included the Republic of Cyprus which is in the first area, Turkey which was not considered eligible in Luxembourg, and Malta, which has declined to embark on the procedure for accession to the European Union."
"My question to Mr van den Broek is: how can we put Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus in the same group?"
"Has anything changed in relation to Turkey and its attitude towards Agenda 2000, towards enlargement, since the Luxembourg European Summit when specific conditions were laid down for Turkey?"
"We do not think in different categories."
"All these countries would be eligible for enlargement and all form part of an enlargement process."
"We clearly explained last year how the enlargement process was operating, and the accession process."
"That notably related to countries for which opinions were made last year."
"Cyprus which, as Mr Alavanos will remember, received an avis in 1993 and did not receive the same kind of opinion as such, has a different kind of preparation than the others because it was further advanced."
"It was already a market economy and it is therefore now in the negotiating process."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, we are complying exactly with the wishes of the European Council of Luxembourg and Cardiff."
"So we made a regular report based on Article 28 including conclusions from Cardiff, including our comments on progress in the European strategy for Turkey and so forth."
"Mr President, if I understood you rightly on Slovakia, you said that following the elections the new government has plans which, if implemented, will offer a chance to introduce democratic processes and the rule of law."
"This has not happened so far, and there has indeed been some criticism in this respect."
"I should be pleased if you could confirm this again."
"Is it the case that the President of the Commission will be receiving the Slovakian Prime Minister on Friday partly in order to mark the difference between this government and the previous one?"
"President Santer and I will be having talks with the new Prime Minister of Slovakia Mr Dzurinda."
"We will convey the following message: Obviously we welcome the new government in place."
"As far as the enlargement process is concerned and Slovakia's place therein, we would be delighted to see a situation develop in which the stability of the political institutions, its democratic nature, the respect for human rights and the rule of law, including respect for the rights of minorities, would be confirmed."
"Secondly, that the shortcomings we noted in the economic situation will be corrected by this government."
"I expect very much that the Prime Minister of Slovakia will make clear what his plans are in this respect."
"He will of course need a certain time for implementation."
"We will closely monitor those developments and when we feel the criteria for the opening of negotiations as such have been fulfilled - and here I am thinking especially of the political ones, but also a number of economic ones - we will recommend the opening of negotiations."
"That is the clear-cut message for the Prime Minister of Slovakia."
"Mr President, the Commission has changed its approach with regard to the arrangements for coordination of the pre-accession instruments."
"I should like to ask, firstly, for what reasons it has done so?"
"And secondly, does this not mean that all the efforts will be concentrated on the PHARE programme?"
"I am not sure I understand what the honourable Member means by 'changing the approach'."
"I am not aware of changing any approach."
"When we talk about the coordination of pre-accession instruments, that has to do with the changes that will take place from the year 2000 onwards when, subject to approval by the budgetary authority, we will have more financial means at our disposal."
"Mr Barón Crespo will be aware of this."
"We will have to coordinate all the various instruments that underpin the preparation for accession in the candidate countries."
"I know there is some discussion going on in the Council regarding the regulations we have proposed in this respect but I hope that conclusions can be drawn in the very near future."
"I do not think it has a political connotation."
"Mr President, Mr van den Broek, we welcome the fact that the Commission is showing a certain flexibility and is, after all, following this Parliament's idea of a starting-line."
"But in the light of its proposals in the protocol on enlargement annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, and of the fact that no progress has been made with the institutional reform of the European Union, does the Commission not perhaps see a risk to the negotiations and to early accession?"
"What is the Commission doing, as the motive force of integration, in order to bring about rapid progress on these questions and on institutional reform in the European Union, which is part of its own domestic responsibilities?"
"It is quite right that while we are talking now about what we wish the candidate countries to do in preparation for membership, that in no way discharges our Member States from making progress in the EU's own reform."
"This is embedded in everything that has to do with Agenda 2000, including proposals for policy change, institutional change and the whole of the financial framework."
"One thing we want to try to avoid is that where we urge the Member States to make progress with Agenda 2000 - and we have made the proposals for that - we should not threaten the candidate countries and undermine their confidence by saying we are taking into account some delays in the European Union not to move them forward towards negotiations or to make progress with the screening etc."
"You are quite right that things have to be balanced, that the EU Member States and the Commission have to take their own responsibilities and try to keep in step."
"Finally, you know full well that when Agenda 2000 was presented last year, it was the Commission referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which gave clear preference to having the whole of the institutional debate in an intergovernmental conference, completed before the first enlargement, before the first new member entered."
"Decisions have not been taken yet but it shows already that the Commission wants to accelerate as much as possible and, insofar as it has influence, the process of institutional reform of the EU itself."
"This sitting is proving to be rather chaotic."
"I hope that this is not a reflection of the enlargement process on which I have two brief questions."
"Firstly, we have been told that Latvia could be included in the first wave, but what about Estonia?"
"Estonia is already part of the first wave but has it made sufficient progress in the treatment of its Russian-speaking minority and is Latvia not now overtaking Estonia in this respect?"
"Secondly, the Commissioner was interrupted at this point, but what about Bulgaria and Romania?"
"Am I right in thinking that we are moving from a process of six plus five to a process of six plus possibly three, plus two, and that the two excluded are Bulgaria and Romania?"
"Are you not concerned that this approach may pose serious internal policy problems within these two countries which will find themselves completely sidelined, even though pre-accession instruments are being proposed?"
"I believe that we are running the risk of destabilising these countries politically."
"On the basis of the principles accepted last year in Agenda 2000, it remains possible that one country will overtake another in the preparations."
"I am not saying that is the case between Estonia and Latvia."
"Latvia is not at the negotiating stage yet although, as I said earlier, very significant progress has been made and there is a perspective."
"But where Latvia has made more progress than Estonia is in the matter of the Russian-speaking minority."
"I referred to the recent referendum in Latvia where this matter - notably of facilitating the naturalisation process and also improving the situation of stateless children - was approved."
"There is still legislation to be adopted in Estonia."
"As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, it was not my intention to put them behind any kind of curtain."
"It was in my speaking notes that I was not able to complete at an earlier stage to say that Bulgaria has made significant progress but comes from further back than a number of other candidate countries."
"So we are very much encouraged by what the Bulgarian Government is doing which is laudable in many respects."
"Unfortunately, I cannot be that enthusiastic about Romania, although I hasten to add that the present government, and especially the present Prime Minister, have concluded themselves that there is a delay in the reforms in Romania."
"We are working very closely together with the authorities there, including the international financial institutions, to try to get the engine running at full speed again."
"Commissioner van den Broek began his statement by saying that he was going to give a report on the 12 candidate countries."
"Can one conclude therefore that the Commission views Turkey as a candidate country, not a potential candidate country?"
"Has it interpreted the Cardiff Summit as meaning that Turkey is a candidate country?"
"Secondly, may I ask if this report has led the Commission to make any recommendations to change the format of pre-accession aid in order to strengthen the work in one area as opposed to another area?"
"Finally, to say that Latvia can begin negotiations at the end of 1999 is rather strange."
"If Latvia is ready, it is ready now; if it is not ready, it needs to wait until the next report next year."
"Is it not rather dangerous to say that we will open negotiations in 12 months' time?"
"It leaves a lot of hostages to fortune."
"Turkey is considered as eligible."
"I do not deny that there is a very interesting ideological debate about the question as to whether it should be called a candidate or not."
"As the Commissioner responsible for relations with Turkey I know exactly how to treat the dossier."
"That has been enumerated both by the Luxembourg and Cardiff conclusions and the European strategy for Turkey is perfectly clear with all that it implies for preparation of membership."
"Obviously with regard to Latvia you could say that it does or does not meet the criteria."
"There is of course a certain grey zone if you say: I am very impressed by the significant improvements which have been made but if I look at the interaction between the economic parameters of the market economy requirement on the one hand and competitiveness on the other, I want more track record to be sure that these requirements are really being met."
"That is the situation with Latvia, except for a number of concrete points that we have referred to in the report where we would like to see some further improvement."
"That has in particular to do with supervision of the financial system, to mention just one example."
"Mr President, it is a sign of a real parliament that it is prepared to eat its bread hot from the oven."
"This afternoon we have seen an example of some of the indigestion which that can cause."
"I suggest you and your colleagues on the Bureau might like to look at ways in which we can improve the flexibility of this plenary in response to both Commission and Council at moments like this."
"Commissioner, it is time someone in this debate sounded a note of congratulations."
"At least at first hearing what you appear to be proposing on Latvia, Slovakia and Lithuania seems an intelligent and pragmatic formulation and you should be congratulated on that."
"But you only mentioned very briefly the largest and most difficult of the dossiers, namely Poland."
"Would you now like to take the opportunity to say something about Poland?"
"Obviously Poland - the largest candidate country in terms of population - belongs to the countries with which we are negotiating."
"There is a very positive note to make, namely that since we had a little incident with that country regarding the preparation and notably regarding projects we felt were not being carried out according to the accession partnership, the Prime Minister and his staff have taken the coordination of the preparatory process firmly in hand."
"That can clearly be seen."
"What cannot be solved so immediately is that it is a country with a still very considerable agricultural sector and with quite significant environmental problems."
"But I would not single Poland out as the worst case although it is automatically the case that with a country as large as this, to a certain extent this dictates the dimensions of its problems."
"You will find this in the composite paper which I hope will reach you today."
"We have tried to summarise as much as possible - without leaving out any country- our general impressions of the whole process."
"I should like to take this opportunity to add an important point, namely the debates we were able to have with Parliament last year about the 'ins' and the 'pre-ins'."
"Firstly, the past year has clearly shown - and I give credit to Parliament for having urged us to follow those procedures - that the difference between those two groups has been greatly reduced."
"We are screening them all and with the pre-ins the screening is moving in the first trimester of next year from the multilateral to the bilateral system."
"This means that the bilateral screening of the pre-ins comes much closer to what we are doing with the negotiators."
"This further reduces the difference and also means that when the pre-ins become negotiators their disadvantage by comparison with the ins will be less than it was at the start."
"Mr President, once again the wind of history is blowing through the House, because it is a historic moment that the Commission has now decided to give the process of enlargement a new credibility and fresh impetus by recognising that Latvia should perhaps have been included in the first wave and could therefore be one of the first of the former dictatorships to become a member of the Union."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that Latvia - if its current development is maintained - could very well be included in the first group of countries to become fully fledged Member States at the beginning of the next millennium."
"So I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that Latvia now has the possibility of joining the very first group, and that Lithuania and Slovakia will of course be able to do so very shortly afterwards."
"I should be grateful if you would confirm that, Commissioner."
"It is always tempting to speak about very clear-cut dates but, especially with regard to membership, we know that many of negotiating countries at present are taking the working hypothesis that they will become full members in 2002 or, most of them, in 2003."
"I am talking about the Group of Six."
"My only answer is that I hope this is so."
"But it is the candidate countries which have to fulfil the conditions to make it possible.The same goes for the opening of negotiations on which I elaborated earlier."
"It is clear that there are the political criteria which are met by Latvia, the economic criteria where we say that we need some more track record but there is a clear perspective that you are approaching the stage where we can recommend this step."
"That is the text in the conclusions of the composite paper. Anything further than that is guesswork."
"I was hoping the Commissioner was late because he was putting the final touches to the evaluation of Malta."
"So I am doubly disappointed to hear you say, Commissioner, that it will be mid-February before you can come up with your new evaluation."
"After all, the Commission gave a favourable opinion in 1995 as did this Parliament, on Malta's accession."
"I would like you to give us the real reason for this delay and also to bear in mind that in Madrid in 1995 it was decided that negotiations would start with Malta six months after the end of the IGC."
"Given that, is there any real reason not to include Malta in the first wave?"
"I think you will agree with me but if you do not you should say it here that Malta is well qualified economically and otherwise ahead of other applicant countries."
"I would like a precise answer here today."
"If we want to do Malta justice under the circumstances which present themselves, namely after an interruption of two years of preparations for accession, it means that we should update our avis of 1993."
"That is exactly what the Council has asked us to do."
"So I have sent a letter to the Maltese authorities and the Foreign Minister will visit us tomorrow."
"He was sent a questionnaire to fill in all the relevant data, which we have also collected from others, so that we can do the work of presenting an update of that avis ."
"I even mentioned a time, namely the beginning or middle of February."
"So it is very close."
"To Mrs Malone I would say that we welcome the revitalisation of Malta's application but we serve that country best by updating the situation."
"I do not expect big suprises but verification should be made and on that basis we will see how Malta can best be incorporated in the further accession preparations."
"I would like to clarify the confusion that at least exists for me following the exchange between Mr Alavanos and the Commission on the subject of Cyprus."
"Let us assume for the purpose of our discussions here, that the problem of the Turkish minority not participating in the discussions did not exist."
"I cannot understand how a minority should impose its rule on a majority, a fact apparently accepted by the European Union but anyway, if this were not an issue, how close is Cyprus to fulfilling the requirements for joining the European Union?"
"In the report on Cyprus there is an economic analysis."
"The honourable Member will be aware that Cyprus has enjoyed quite a protected economy in the past so liberalization has to continue."
"We certainly have no reason to warn Cyprus of anything although there are certain things, for example the banking system and some judiciary matters which could be improved and which belong to the package which all candidate countries are working on."
"As far as the question of the North is concerned, I share the honourable Member's wish that the participation of the Turkish Cypriots would materialise for the simple reason that it is our common objective to see to it that membership of Cyprus eventually benefits both communities."
"This has been stated umpteen times in summit conclusions."
"But we cannot force anyone's hand - certainly not Mr Denktash's."
"It is his responsibility if he continues to refuse to participate in the negotiating delegation."
"In the meantime we shall continue our work with Cyprus."
"Mr President, Mr van den Broek mentioned in his speech, when referring to the situation of gypsies or Romanies, that when it comes to political criteria, and especially the status of minorities, there is cause for concern in many applicant countries."
"It is important that the Commissioner should have given attention to the status of minorities, which account for many millions of people, in applicant countries."
"We know, for example, that many Czech Romanies have sought asylum in the United Kingdom and Canada."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission has drawn any conclusions on what is now required of applicant countries to improve the status of the Romany population."
"Apart from the encouragement to governments to continue to work on these issues, a number of our financial cooperation programmes - PHARE for example - include programmes to improve the situation of this minority."
"As I said quite frankly, so far our conclusion is that it is not enough of a political priority in the policies of the countries concerned."
"That means that in our contacts with them - and you will also find the request to do something about it in the accession partnerships - we will continue to advocate an improvement of that situation and make our programmes available to come closer to that end."
"Mr President, thank you at any rate to the Commission for announcing this to Parliament first rather than the press, and also for telling us that some countries have made real progress and have thus moved up a step in terms of accession negotiations."
"In the case of Bulgaria, I am happy to see that serious progress has been made."
"I think one has to acknowledge that loud and clear."
"But I have one question concerning one very difficult issue in relations between the European Union and Bulgaria, and that is of course the nuclear question, the question of Kosloduch."
"And the Bulgarian Government's latest proposals talk of decommissioning dates which are quite different from what was originally promised and formalised in an agreement back in 1993."
"So I would ask the Commission to tell us as precisely as possible how important it thinks this nuclear question is and how it affects Bulgaria's accession prospects."
"I am being careful because I regularly tend to mix up the nuclear power plants in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia."
"But one thing is absolutely clear."
"Nuclear safety forms an extremely important part of our cooperation with the candidate countries."
"We have made it perfectly clear that as far as closing dates are concerned, we count on the closure of these plants on the basis of the nuclear safety agreements entered into earlier."
"Moreover, one can sometimes dispute what exactly constitutes the lifetime of a certain element in a nuclear power plant and we are listening to experts."
"Those are the experts who are connected to the EBRD nuclear safety account etc."
"Lack of concrete data today prevents me from being more specific but rest assured that the question of the close down of nuclear plants, which we are convinced can never reach the levels of safety required by international safety standards, remains a high priority in our cooperation."
"Mr President, I asked to be allowed a question as soon as the Commissioner began, and you are now telling me that the debate is nearly over."
"But I have not had a chance to speak."
"And yet, I observed that some Members have spoken - I am not complaining about that - who came in a long time after the Commissioner began."
"What is going on?"
"I repeatedly asked the gentleman who was sitting next to you, and he told me not to worry, because I was on the list."
"And now you tell me that the debate is nearly over."
"I asked to speak just after the Commissioner began."
"I protest!"
"Mr Ephremidis, I have to distribute speaking time fairly among the nationalities and political groups."
"Two people from your group have already spoken, and one of those, Mr Alavanos, is of the same nationality as you."
"Many Members have asked to speak and I have been unable to allow them all to do so."
"I do apologise."
"These decisions are always difficult."
"I give the floor to Mr Bonde."
"Institutional and financial questions regarding the candidate countries are - looking at earlier negotiations - as a matter of tradition reserved for the end of the negotiations."
"So the answer to the honourable Member is: No."
"As far as the negotiations with the Six themselves are concerned, we will have the first ministerial negotiations on 10 November."
"The common positions of the EU Council will be established on 9 November at the General Affairs Council."
"A number of transitional periods have been asked for by candidate countries, notably regarding the telecommunications sector."
"What exactly will be the reply?"
"We have advised the Council and the presidency to ask for more clarification because we are not quite certain that the exceptions being requested reflect a correct understanding of the telecommunications and audiovisual directives etc. That is the best answer I can give at the present time."
"Obviously this is an ongoing process."
"Thank you very much."
"I am grateful to Commissioner van den Broek for making himself available to allow this debate to be extended, and for the clear answers he has provided to all the questions raised."
"Partnership for Integration"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Partnership for Integration."
"I give the floor to Mr Bartenstein, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you the progress the Council has made since the Cardiff European Council in integrating the environment and sustainable development into other policy areas."
"Let me begin by giving you a practical example to explain the need for integration."
"The climate change caused by man and its adverse effects on the environment and mankind are the most serious global environmental problem facing us."
"That is why all the industrialised countries undertook to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. those caused by man, under the Kyoto protocol."
"The EU Member States jointly undertook to reduce emissions by 8 %, a target that can only be achieved by common and coordinated measures."
"Transport will be a decisive sector here."
"The aim of the voluntary agreement with the European umbrella organisation of car manufacturers on the introduction of the '6-litre' car by the year 2008 is to contribute about 15 % to that European Union target figure."
"Given that the volume of traffic is still rising, however, unless guideline measures are taken in transport policy it will not be possible to reduce CO2 emissions; instead, they will rise by about 30 %."
"So technical improvements must be backed up by European and national economic instruments."
"We must do more to internalise external costs."
"One way to check the growth of private car and heavy goods traffic while satisfying the needs of both man and the economy for mobility is to improve the rail infrastructure at national but also international level, for instance through the trans-European railway networks."
"This brief example of what is involved in climate protection shows that the only way to resolve the problems facing us is by taking an integrated approach which cuts across all policy areas."
"We should therefore regard Agenda 2000 and the post-Kyoto climate strategy as the key to integrating the environment and sustainability into other policy areas, as stated in the Commission's communication."
"The first steps towards integrating environmental and transport policy were taken jointly at informal and formal Environment and Transport Councils."
"So I welcome the motion for a resolution submitted by the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We see the involvement of the European Parliament in the partnership called for by the Commission as an important factor in the success of this common project."
"Sustainable integration can only be achieved if all the Community institutions, and of course also the Member States, take the appropriate initiatives."
"In the final analysis, and in the light of the subsidiarity principle, the Member State governments and parliaments must also make the integration of sustainable development a leitmotif of their national strategies in the field of transport, agriculture, energy, taxation and so on."
"The fifth environmental action programme had already put forward the idea of integrating the environment into other policy areas."
"Yet it took a long time for this idea, however persuasive in itself, to make any real headway."
"At the time, one of the factors was presumably the lack of awareness in other policy areas of the need to take account of environmental protection in all decisionmaking."
"But no doubt another obstacle was the fact that the action programme was not legally binding and that the various policy areas were not sufficiently interlinked."
"Meanwhile, a number of decisions taken in the European Union have led to greater recognition of the importance of integration and the concept of sustainability."
"One key factor is no doubt the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, which lays down at primary legal level that the requirements of environmental protection must be considered when Community policies and measures are defined and implemented, with special emphasis on promoting sustainable development."
"At the Luxembourg summit, the heads of state and government took this matter up again and undertook to make substantial progress."
"Of course, we environmental politicians remain the motive force of integration."
"That is our primary interest."
"With the call by the heads of state and government on all the appropriate Councils to draw up their own strategies for taking real account of the requirements of the environment and sustainable development in their particular policy area, responsibility for integrating environmental requirements has now been transferred to sectoral level."
"Subsequently, the European Council in its turn will examine these strategies."
"It is most welcome to find that these three particular sectors - transport, energy and agriculture - are fully responding to the demands of the Cardiff European Council and drawing up their reports for the Vienna summit."
"Moreover, one chapter of the planned General Affairs Council report on Agenda 2000 for the Vienna summit will be devoted to the integration of environmental aspects into regional and cohesion policy, i.e. the Structural Funds, in the framework of Agenda 2000."
"The Council's reports will be adopted in the form of conclusions and submitted directly to the European Council."
"The presidency and the Commission jointly submitted draft reports on agriculture and transport in the respective Council working groups."
"In the energy sector, there is a separate Commission communication, in addition to the Council report."
"The drafts of these three reports now before us show that efforts have clearly been made to comply with the requirements set out by the Commission in its communication and by the European Council in Cardiff."
"All the reports will indicate both the measures already taken and activities for the future."
"Over and above this, all the documents address the need to define sustainability indicators and to formulate a more comprehensive strategy for each sector."
"In future, the sectoral Councils must lay special emphasis on developing indicators and defining targets to be reviewed."
"At present, the determination of a practical deadline for the choice of indicators is still under discussion in all three areas."
"Account should be taken here of the ongoing work in the United Nations, the OECD, Eurostat and, last but not least, the European Environment Agency."
"To be realistic, however, there is not enough time to define comprehensive strategies and indicators between just two European Councils."
"Work must continue on determining sectoral strategies with timescales and practical measures, with a view to the forthcoming European Council in Cologne and also that in Helsinki in the year 1999."
"Let me make a few brief comments on the content of the three sectors."
"As regards energy, environmental protection without doubt represents one of the three principles of the European Union's energy policy, together with security of supplies and competitiveness."
"Having regard in particular to the Kyoto protocol commitments, the Energy Council is making environmental questions an integral part of its activities."
"Measures to integrate environmental protection into this Community sector have been defined for the single energy market in relation to energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and the framework programme on energy."
"Regarding transport, here too the Environment Council has already taken practical measures to reduce pollution, for instance with the Auto-Oil programme and the voluntary agreement with the car industry I referred to earlier on introducing the '6-litre' car."
"Here we must thank the Commission warmly for its activities."
"The continuous demand for transport services and mobility does, however, remain a challenge that we have not yet resolved."
"Regrettably, all the technical progress made in reducing pollution is still more than offset by the continuous growth in traffic."
"The Commission has drawn up and submitted a number of proposals to help resolve this problem, which the Council will be considering without delay."
"As for agriculture, integration measures have already been decided in the areas of landscape, biodiversity, water, soil and clean air."
"The forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy under Agenda 2000 will bring further, major progress towards integration, for example in relation to rural development."
"Whether we can achieve practical results of course depends largely on the programmes and measures at national and regional level."
"Although energy, transport and agriculture are without doubt particularly important sectors of integration, of course they are not the only relevant policy areas."
"In line with the Cardiff decisions, other Councils are also involved."
"In my view, we should pay special attention to the central, environment-related issues of coming years, such as climate protection and the Kyoto follow-up, together with EU enlargement, when we formulate sectoral strategies."
"Without questioning the fact that the individual Councils are responsible for their strategy, I do believe that in the longer term we need an all-embracing, blanket concept of sustainable development."
"At the informal Environment Council in Graz in July 1998, we agreed in this connection that we would try to identify best-practice models of integration in our Member States."
"On the basis of these models, we would be able to review the decision-making structures at Community level and in the Member States."
"In the long term, we must integrate the environment and sustainable development into both our strategies and our decisions."
"Let me point out again that it is most important to the further success of this process that the European Parliament plays an active and supportive role in the partnership for integration with the Council and the Commission."
"The motion for a resolution contains a large number of calls on the European Council and the Commission."
"Commissioner Bjerregaard will be describing to you in more detail what contribution the Commission will be making in future."
"I am sure you all agree with me that the process has only just begun, and that obviously this kind of project can only succeed in the long term."
"That is why we need close cooperation between the Member States, extending beyond the span of a single presidency, and cooperation between the institutions if we are to succeed."
"We need to have a comprehensive strategy for integration and sustainability before us by the year 2000, when the continuation of the fifth action programme comes on to the agenda."
"The Cardiff follow-up process should be linked to the preparation of another environmental action programme to ensure the continuity and coherence of future European environment policy."
"Here I am firmly convinced that only the concept of integrating sustainable development into all the policy areas concerned can help us to make real progress in resolving pan-European and global environmental problems in the long term and to improve our standard of living and maintain it for generations to come."
"I believe that if we wish to make further progress towards integrating the environment in other policy areas, it is essential for this process to be pursued at the top political level of heads of state and government."
"The success of Cardiff must be pursued in Vienna!"
"But successful integration also requires long-term planning."
"Germany and Finland, the next two presidencies, have already announced that they are prepared to continue with this work, so as to maintain the dynamic of this process even beyond the millennium."
"We need to have a vision of the future shape of European environmental policy."
"The concept of integrating the environment and sustainable development into all sectors can and must form a solid basis for creating this kind of vision for the next millennium."
"I am glad that the Council, the Commission and in particular Parliament all accept this challenge."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Parliament's Committee on the Environment for tabling this motion for a resolution on what is one of the most important issues in environment policy, namely the integration of environmental aspects into other Community policies."
"As we all know, and as has been discussed on many occasions both here in Parliament and in the Council, the source of many of our environmental problems lies in other policies."
"It may be transport, energy or the agricultural sector, as Mr Bartenstein has already mentioned."
"We need to make changes in these policies in order to improve the environment."
"It is exactly the same when it comes to implementing the Kyoto protocol."
"We can only fulfil our obligations if we involve other sectors and make changes in the policies there."
"As you know, the Amsterdam Treaty gave impetus to the process of integration."
"The requirement of sustainable development now occupies a central place in the Treaty, since it is included in one of the first articles."
"The integration of environmental aspects has thus become a key instrument for achieving our objectives, and there is no doubting the priority attached to these aspects."
"This is a significant victory and, I hope, a crucial turning-point in the development of Community measures on the environment."
"I shall repeat what the Commission stated in its communication to the Cardiff summit: integration has become a commitment."
"It is no longer simply a possibility."
"I would be among the first to admit that this goal will not be easy to achieve."
"We all know how difficult it is to persuade those responsible for the individual sectors - whether in the Commission, the Council or Parliament - to get to grips with environmental questions, in other words to tackle the environmental aspects, and - perhaps even more difficult - to coordinate their efforts."
"I have been very pleased with the efforts made by the European Parliament, because I know how difficult it can be to convince colleagues working in other sectors such as agriculture and transport that they should take account of the environment."
"The Commission's communication to the Cardiff summit and the clear and positive response it received have set a process in motion."
"The request that all sectors within the Council should review their own policies and formulate a future strategy for sustainable development provides an essentially new dimension, in particular because it is linked to a requirement for indicators to be identified which can be used in the monitoring process and in policy development."
"The Commission departments concerned are already working with the presidency on reports on the agriculture, energy and transport sectors for the Vienna summit, as Mr Bartenstein also pointed out."
"We are talking about the first step in the process and, in the light of this, we shall have to decide on the subsequent activities."
"Choosing indicators and reaching agreement on objectives are important factors in assessing the success of the strategies."
"During 1999, we need to reach agreement on the indicators for those sectors which have the highest priority."
"This task is not without difficulties, since it is with the help of indicators that we can obtain very precise information on the state of the environment, if we know the right indicators to use and use them correctly."
"At the same time, the indicators are also what one might call a kind of tell-tale as regards the results of previous policy choices."
"The Commission has also committed itself to carrying out environmental assessments of its major proposals, and you will see the first practical demonstration of this in the Commission's programme of work for 1999."
"We have been very active in bringing about the integration of the environmental aspect, as can be clearly seen in the Agenda 2000 proposals."
"I am quite sure that many of these proposals broke new ground in terms of integrating the environment into other policies, such as agriculture and the Structural Funds."
"Now the challenge is to have these confirmed through final decisions at Community level, both here in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers, and here we still need to make every effort to achieve success."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's support in the process, since the motion for a resolution broadly supports the initiatives we have taken hitherto."
"As far as I can see, there is just one small difference of opinion with regard to Parliament's wish to have a directive on this subject."
"I do not entirely understand how it is thought that this could operate in practice, and in fact I believe that our proposal for a directive on strategic environmental assessment already represents a remarkable step forward towards integrating the environmental dimension into Member States' plans and programmes."
"We are indeed therefore working very hard to ensure that this proposal is adopted."
"I would remind the House that the Commission's communication on Partnership for Integration was also addressed to Parliament, with a request that it should review its own procedures to see how it could increase its contribution to integration."
"I can see from the motion for a resolution that the House is carrying out such a review, and I look forward to working with Parliament on any measures which it decides to introduce in response to this request."
"Mr President, I must say the very existence of this debate today is an example of the cooperation between Parliament and the other institutions."
"It was very clear to us that we needed to have such a debate in public and this has proved possible with the cooperation of both Mrs Bjerregaard and Mr Bartenstein."
"I am very pleased with the comments they have made today."
"Articles 2 and 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty state unequivocally that environmental requirements are brought into the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities."
"The Commission communication on partnership for integration which reiterates this obligation is clearly a step in the right direction in our view."
"In the light of enlargement, current Agenda 2000 proposals, Community strategy for implementing the Kyoto protocol and the Commission communication on the European Community biodiversity strategy, it is very clear that integration is important if we are going to achieve sustainability."
"However, though I do not want to pour cold water on anything, I recall the words of Jacques Delors after the Rio Conference some years ago."
"After that experience President Delors said that Rio tended to be about heads of state turning up to Rio making speeches just like the great and the good going to church on Sunday, praying ostentatiously and publicly for the poor and then putting the minimum in the poor box as they left the church."
"It is not enough to say these things, welcome though the words are."
"We need to do them as well."
"It is not enough to say there is a need to do it."
"The European Union has a tremendously significant role in this."
"None of our individual Member States can tackle the problems of pollution and conservation."
"None of the problems of trans-frontier difficulty can be dealt with by individual Member States."
"Therefore we ought to deal with employment and industry, transport and agriculture etc. within the single market, the sustainability framework and the integration framework.The holistic approach is essential if we are to create real sustainability as outlined by the Fifth Environmental Action Plan which, after all, was developed in a straight line from Brundtland in 1987 to Rio in 1992 and Agenda 21."
"Environment policy clearly has to be integrated into all policy areas."
"It needs the maximum participation of the public, of industry and of NGOs."
"It needs to be a genuine partnership."
"That means we have to have a real look at current growth strategies and the reorganisation of current consumption patterns."
"This resolution goes in the right direction."
"It will provide further impetus towards the sustainable development goal we are all trying to achieve."
"Unfortunately, some Member States are high on rhetoric and low on action."
"Therefore, paragraph 10 and its instruction to the Council of Ministers to monitor Member States' action in implementing the communication and partnership for integration is important."
"It is good to hear Mr Bartenstein's views."
"It is a refreshing attempt to drive integration into the consciousness of Member States."
"However, it is necessary to have a structure to ensure that it is not merely good intentions on the part of the Member States with words replacing concrete agreements and concrete actions."
"We need these actions and we need timetables and I am very pleased to hear that the work on developing indicators is going ahead."
"We need that to go ahead and we need to be quite clear about when we expect it to finish."
"In conclusion, it is time to take these words and translate them into action."
"There is no question but that the Council and the Commission have the full support of Parliament if they are genuinely supporting integration as a strategy."
"Madam President, I think we are all entitled to congratulate ourselves on this joint debate between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"It is most important for our citizens to be aware of the true nature of the Community's legislative institutions."
"By means of a three-way dialogue, these three institutions jointly determine the final outcome."
"It is also important for us to consider the implementation of what is already contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which it is to be hoped will soon be ratified by all the Member States."
"Environmental policy has ceased to be a separate area. We have now adopted a holistic approach, and environmental policy is an integral part of all other policies."
"This is the message we have to convey to every sector, and in particular to all the administrations."
"Hence the importance of the agreement at the Cardiff European Council."
"I am very pleased that the Council has realised that it is responsible not only for making national administrations aware of these requirements, but also for coordinating regional and local policies."
"This is essential, otherwise we shall not be able to meet our objective."
"It would also be desirable, in my view, for the Council to change its working practices. The Commission has already changed its internal working practices, and the European Parliament is preparing to review its Rules of Procedure for the next parliamentary term."
"It is for the Council to decide, but joint meetings of ministers for the environment and other ministers are evidently not enough."
"I believe the internal system should be changed."
"As regards how best to convey specific instructions to other administrations at local, regional and national level, it seems to me that the system laid down in the directive on environmental auditing of firms could serve as an excellent model, and could also be applied to different levels of the administrations."
"With reference to specific policies, Parliament has been waiting for some years now for the objective of replacing wage costs - or part of these - by environmental levies to be achieved."
"Despite a number of efforts, we have still not received a satisfactory answer from the Commission and one which is acceptable to the Council, so the challenge still remains."
"Specific measures are also needed to promote consumer habits which are compatible with sustainable development."
"I do not think we have made a sufficient effort to promote alternative sources of energy, even though the Community institutions have dealt with the matter on several occasions."
"Finally, Madam President, I think we should be delighted that the Council is hoping to give some continuity to its work and its policies regardless of the rotation of the presidency every six months."
"I am sure too that we are all pleased with the work done by the Environment Commissioner, and glad that she has made a full recovery."
"Mr President, firstly may I welcome Mrs Bjerregaard back to the Chamber."
"I gather she is once more fully fit and ready to stand with us in doing battle for the environment."
"Welcome back, Commissioner!"
"What we do here at European Union level serves as an example to the Member States."
"We in the Union were the first - the Council, the Commission and Parliament - to incorporate the concept of sustainability into other areas of policy."
"And we need to do it well, because then the Member States will have a good example to follow."
"We have made people realise that including sustainability in other areas is not simply possible, but mandatory."
"So we need guidelines and indicators so that we can check that it is being done."
"Mrs Bjerregaard says it will be difficult to develop these, but we shall see what the Commission's programme for 1999 has to say on the subject."
"More important still is whether or not we can in fact put the idea of including sustainability in other areas into practice, because the Amsterdam Treaty, which my country has today decided to ratify, requires Member States to take account of environmental imperatives in all other forms of Community policy."
"So we shall have to see how that pans out."
"Agenda 2000, the Kyoto agreement, biodiversity - these are the things which will prove whether we in the European Union can indeed integrate sustainability into all areas of our policy."
"We have made a number of demands."
"Every six months at least, we want a joint Council meeting between the environment ministers and other ministers for agriculture, transport and so on. We also want ECOFIN and other Councils to consult the environment ministers when they take decisions on regional policy."
"Lastly, a question to the Council representative."
"At the Vienna summit shortly, you will be reviewing the progress achieved towards integration over the last six months."
"There will be a document coming out of that, and we would very much appreciate being given this Council document and a chance to express our views on it."
"Will you ensure that Parliament receives the document you will be debating or have debated in Vienna, so that we can express our views on it?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am glad you are with us again and are feeling better, and I am also very glad that this subject is now being tackled in a practical way under the Austrian Presidency."
"Sustainable, environmentally friendly development in the Union has been enshrined as our aim for many years now."
"We have not achieved this aim because there is often a wide gap between words and deeds, and because we have not had the necessary strategies and mechanisms for integrating environmental policy properly into the other policy areas and thereby achieving sustainable development."
"I therefore welcome the proposed partnership for integration, and I hope - perhaps the President-in-Office and the Commissioner do not quite agree, but I think others may well do so - that Parliament will not just be involved in this partnership as a junior partner, but will have the same rights as the other institutions and work together with them in a very open and visible way on integrating environmental questions more closely into the other areas."
"As an example, let me quote the Kyoto follow-up process."
"We have committed ourselves to a definite target: an 8 % reduction in emissions in the European Union."
"If we want to achieve this target, we must not only decide how to distribute the burden, but must also check whether the Member States really do reduce the emissions to the level to which they have committed themselves."
"We should also consider what to do if they do not reduce the emissions to that level."
"I do not agree that we do not need laws for this purpose, Commissioner."
"I believe that a legislative framework is particularly necessary to meet the Kyoto target, because it is not just a question of indicators and objectives, but also of the measures to achieve those objectives and indeed of the measures to be taken if they cannot be achieved."
"Madam President, it is easy to add one's voice to the general call by the Commission, the Council and Parliament for real action to integrate the environment into all policy areas."
"I do not believe it is enough to speak of sustainable development in a general way."
"We need to adopt an approach that aims to promote the improvement of the environment."
"Traffic is of course one of the biggest problems, and the prevention of gas emissions is a central feature of our policy to improve the environment. The best way of guiding consumer behaviour is by putting money in consumers' pockets, and the Auto-Oil programme is a good example of this."
"It contains a system of tax incentives and penalties, the stick and carrot method, to promote the use of better-quality fuels and make the use of poorer quality fuels more expensive."
"This scheme could be extended to many other areas."
"The forthcoming AGENDA 2000 programme now under discussion in Parliament and the Council is a concrete indication of where we really want to be heading."
"On regional and structural policy the Commission's proposals are good as far as words go, but not enough has been done in practice."
"The environment authorities really must be included in all programmes on an equal footing with the other parties that are actively involved."
"In agriculture it is not enough to say that it is the task of the Member States to see to it that the environmental objectives agreed on are met."
"There has to be action on a Union-wide basis."
"Aid must not be granted if insufficient attention is being paid to environmental matters."
"The work that precedes enlargement is important and it requires great efforts, because we cannot allow a situation where new states join before they have completed their environmental preparations and lengthy transitional periods are therefore needed."
"We know that if enlargement goes ahead like this it will only harm the state of the environment in the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this brief but most important debate, because apart from a few criticisms and a few suggestions it has also brought wide agreement on what has been achieved by way of integration in recent months, starting with the UK Presidency and now under the current Austrian Presidency, and what will no doubt also be achieved under the German and Finnish presidencies."
"It is quite clear that Mr Collins is more than justified in quoting Mr Delors: the days of speechifying must come to an end!"
"We have to take action, and to do so we need the right instruments."
"We need indicators, we need aims, and we also need the mechanisms for reviewing them."
"But at the same time we need a sense of common purpose."
"Here in particular - and people have spoken of a trialogue - the Council, Parliament and the Commission must work together to achieve their goal."
"For reasons of competition alone, individual Member States are rarely able to make progress here."
"Only Europe can set an example of sustainable development, because we know that since Rio we have had anything but sustainable development, especially outside our continent."
"But it is not enough for the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and the national governments too, to join forces; once again I agree with Mr Collins that of course we also need public support, cooperation with industry - in other words the private sector - and in particular with the non-governmental organisations."
"We would all consider it impossible to pursue environmental policy without them."
"Indeed, we can no longer regard environmental policy as a sectoral policy."
"We need partnership with our government colleagues, however difficult that may be on a day-to-day basis."
"New initiatives such as the joint Transport and Environment Councils may be important, but they are not the be-all and end-all."
"Even outside these joint meetings, we must still feel that the environment and sustainable development are live issues that go beyond Environment Councils."
"It is important and all to the good, and sets a good example for the European Union, that the first major measure to transpose the Kyoto protocol in Europe was taken at European, at Community level."
"Let me reiterate my thanks to the Commission for its very successful negotiations with the European car industry: 15 % along the road to the Kyoto target, one seventh of the way, is a good start."
"It must be followed by further European and also national measures."
"Of course, Vienna should be another milestone in this process and it will be important to know how our heads of state and government respond to the reports the three Councils - whose activities I consider positive in principle - have submitted and will be submitting."
"And of course I am prepared to inform the European Parliament immediately of the outcome of the Vienna summit in this regard."
"There is a wide gulf between words and deeds, Mrs Graenitz said, and she is quite right."
"But I believe that we do have some grounds for hoping that, with our integration policy, we now have the right strategy for capping words with deeds."
"We not only have the right strategy, I believe we have the only possible strategy."
"We know of no other, we know of no better."
"I believe the real test will be how far sustainable development is now incorporated into our post-Kyoto strategy, our climate protection activities, and of course into the three important areas of Agenda 2000 - by which I mean the Structural Funds, the future of agriculture and EU enlargement."
"We should be equal partners, and here it will be important to act at Community level."
"In a few days' time, we shall be meeting in Buenos Aires for the next climate protection conference."
"Even if it is not likely to produce the kind of results we saw in Kyoto, in the sense of defining major objectives, it will have to be a milestone towards laying down the rules of play, rules of play on which the European Union will have a real say, rules of play which make it clear that climate protection is one of the most important tasks on the way to achieving sustainable development, which is to say that it is also one of the great challenges."
"With that in mind, I thank you warmly for your attention."
"Madam President, I must first of all thank the House for its good wishes for my health."
"Happily, I think I can say that I am on the road to recovery."
"I agree with the many comments which have been made to the effect that we are heading in a direction where we must do something and that people are becoming rather tired of all the speeches and well-meaning words."
"I think it was Mr Collins who pointed straight to Rio, and so it is of course important that we have also involved the Council and the heads of state and government directly in this project."
"I agree with Parliament that it is a good thing that the presidency and the Commission are having this debate with Parliament today."
"I also share Mr Collins' view that the problem cannot be solved by the individual Member States alone."
"It is a Community project."
"On the other hand - as Mr Collins stressed - it is of course a precondition that the Member States should stand by their commitments if we are to succeed, and at any rate we have Mr Bartenstein's word today that the presidency will do all it can to bring this about."
"Likewise, I share Mr Valverde's view that the environment is no longer a sectoral policy, and I agree with the points which most speakers made as regards the results of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Clearly, financial resources play a major role in environment policy, but here in Parliament - and for that matter in the Council - it is known only too well what kind of difficulties we have encountered every single time we have tried to achieve any Community results in this sector."
"We may not have been able to demonstrate major successes in this area, but that should not prevent us from continuing to work on it."
"I can confirm to Mr Eisma that we are working on indicators and, as I said in my first speech, I am expecting us to be able to produce something much more concrete in this respect in 1999."
"I stand by what I said earlier, namely that it is a difficult task, but I entirely agree with Mr Eisma that it is one which must be resolved."
"Mrs Graenitz referred to the responsibilities of individual countries, and this ties in very well with the point which Mrs Myller made, namely that the local authorities play a very important role in environment policy."
"I would once again stress that I believe that in Agenda 2000 we have a number of measures concerning integration of the environment sector which it is very important to maintain, and this applies to the agricultural sector - which Mrs Myller mentioned in her comments - and indeed also to the process of enlargement, where in my opinion we are facing greater problems than we have ever seen in terms of implementing a sensible policy on the environment."
"I naturally hope that Parliament has noted the presidency's positive comments on the agreement with the car industry on CO2 emissions."
"This was one of the debates I had with Parliament not so long ago in which we were not entirely in agreement, but we believe that this is a crucial aspect of the climate negotiations and that we have made a contribution to solving the climate problems."
"That is why we worked very actively to achieve a result."
"Let me end by saying that there is no doubt that practising integration is difficult, but on the other hand it is also necessary if we are to find the solution to our environmental problems now and in the future."
"This requires all sectors to simply accept that they represent both part of the problem and part of the solution."
"Only if all the parties involved accept and understand the situation can we hope for better decisions to be taken."
"I believe that we have taken a step forward in the process, but we have only started, and I welcome the undertakings which Parliament and the presidency have given."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard, and I too would like to wish you a very speedy recovery."
"I have received a motion for a resolution (B4-0981/98) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Homeopathic medicinal products"
"The next item is the report (A4-0378/98) by Mr Chanterie, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Directives 92/73/EEC and 92/74/EEC on homeopathic medicinal products (COM(97)0362 - C4-0484/97)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since September 1992 we have had two further directives in the European Union concerning the approximation of legislative and administrative provisions applicable to medicinal products and laying down additional rules for homeopathic medicinal products for both human and veterinary use."
"In these, four considerations are paramount: firstly, the accessibility of homeopathic medicines; secondly, the quality and safety of those medicines; thirdly, information for users of homeopathic medicines; and fourthly, rules governing the manufacture and supervision of these medicines."
"On behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I should like to particularly highlight four of the points made in the report."
"Firstly, recognition."
"Article 6(1) says that each Member State must take due account of registrations and authorisations previously granted by another Member State."
"To us it is not clear what is meant by 'due account'."
"And who decides whether a Member State has taken 'due account' of the other Member State?"
"This is an unclear formulation and we would like it replaced."
"Secondly, the special, simplified registration procedure."
"This applies only to products taken by mouth or used externally."
"Other forms of administration such as injections, plasters, sprays, drops, suppositories and so on are excluded."
"On the one hand there are no scientific arguments to justify this exclusion and, on the other hand, some Member States do use this specially simplified registration procedure for certain forms of administration."
"Article 7(1) also restricts the special, simplified registration procedure to preparations where the degree of dilution does not exceed one part per 10 000 of the mother tincture or a maximum of 1/100th of the smallest dose used in allopathy for active principles in medicinal products requiring a doctor's prescription."
"Again, there are no scientific reasons for imposing those limits and, once again, some Member States allow preparations which do not meet these criteria."
"Another point concerning Article 7(1) is veterinary use."
"This is restricted to pet animals or exotic animals and not animals used for human consumption."
"There is nothing to warrant this, not environmental protection, not public health and not the consumer interest."
"We therefore propose that this restriction to exotic species or pet animals should be dropped."
"My third point concerns labelling."
"Article 7(2) contains a requirement that the label or package insert should mention only the scientific name of the homeopathic stock material and not use fantasy names."
"But patients need recognisable product indications and clear product descriptions."
"We think that fantasy names should be allowed, especially for combined preparations, provided no therapeutic effect is implied or introduced."
"Article 7(2) also requires the express indication that this is 'a homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indication'."
"The Commission notes that the Member States vary quite considerably in their compliance with this requirement."
"Manufacturers claim that an indication of this kind discriminates against their products in favour of other medicines, and is pointless given that therapeutic indication is not part of the registration procedure."
"It is suggested that the European Commission should replace this wording with an alternative text."
"Our committee is proposing 'application in accordance with clinical homeopathic pharmacology'."
"Personally, I would have preferred to see 'registered homeopathic medicinal product', but I understand we can expect further indications from the Commission on that."
"Then there is the mandatory warning about consulting a doctor."
"I think I speak for the great majority of the committee in saying that we think a doctor should be consulted when any form of medication is taken, and that we are in favour of keeping this mandatory warning."
"I think this mandatory warning might be worded better and that our report represents an advance here."
"My final point concerns the special provisions."
"Article 9(2) says that homeopathic medicinal products not eligible for a special simplified registration procedure are to be evaluated and either approved or not on the basis of four other directives."
"Under that article, however, Member States are allowed - but not obliged - to introduce or apply special rules for pharmacological, toxicological and clinical testing in accordance with the principles and special characteristics of homeopathic medicine as practised in the Member State concerned."
"Some Member States have done this, but most have not or have not done so yet, with distortions of competition as a result."
"So it would seem that Member States need to be compelled to introduce these special provisions so that we can achieve freedom of movement for homeopathic medicines, since we are talking here about half of all the homeopathic medicines used."
"That is all I have to say, Madam President."
"Those are our committee's suggestions for amending the existing directive."
"We shall be very interested to hear the European Commission's response."
"Madam President, I would like to explain something about homeopathic medicines which perhaps in other cultures in Europe is not entirely understood."
"Homeopathic medicines and the way in which people use them varies very widely in the way in which they are perceived."
"In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, for example, homeopathic medicine is seen to be the preserve of the rather eccentric fringes of medicine rather than being a core area of medicine."
"That is one of the reasons why it is quite wrong for us to go for binding agreements and binding regulations on all Member States."
"Member States are moving at a different rate."
"This is highlighted by the concerns of the Agriculture Committee about some of the ingredients of homeopathic medicine."
"Here we have tinctures such as arsenic which we are being asked to put onto animals in the food chain."
"There seems to be no scientific evidence that they actually work and little scientific evidence that they are harmless."
"One thing we want to stress is that all mother tinctures should be subject to rigorous scientific tests to establish dilution levels consistent with safety in the food chain."
"We are also concerned about the use of fantasy names."
"They must not make therapeutic claims that cannot be sustained by rigorous testing."
"We would also assume that all homeopathic remedies are used only on the basis that they are handled by qualified practitioners."
"And finally - and it is important that we get this point over - it is not just that this testing and monitoring should be done by people from the homeopathic community on their own."
"It must be capable of withstanding rigorous scientific testing from other parts of the scientific community."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Chanterie, for his very broad coverage of this issue and for having taken account of the views of the committees."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has examined the subject from the angle of implementation of the single market."
"The Member States have not actually applied the 1992 Directives, which harmonised requirements for homeopathic medical products to be brought onto the market, so a problem has been caused by the fact that these products have not been able to circulate freely."
"The committee has also observed that the manufacturers of homeopathic medicinal products are usually small and medium-sized companies, and they are greatly hampered in their work by the diversity that exists in legislation and approval procedures among the different countries."
"The committee feels that a system of reciprocal recognition regarding these products should be adopted so that safety criteria for the recognition scheme can be defined at EU level, and the first Member State in which a product is registered should assess and document to what extent these jointly determined criteria are met."
"The principles of 'good manufacturing practice' and 'good laboratory practice' could be adopted."
"In this way we can ensure that there will be no safety risk of any kind."
"The Committee also supports the idea that fantasy names for homeopathic medicines could be approved."
"Convention certainly differs from country to country."
"But those countries where homeopathy is better known have been able to confirm that these medicines do not cause side-effects."
"They are cheap, and, although the effect mechanisms cannot always be clearly ascertained using traditional methods, they work."
"Madam President, the question of homeopathic medicinal products does, of course, come within the remit of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, and many of the aspects that concern us have already been addressed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Firstly, I too wish to express warm thanks to Mr Chanterie, who has endorsed many of our committee's requests, indeed all of them."
"Like the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we too have called for a system of mutual recognition;"
"Mrs Hautala has already told you this."
"I believe it is also most important, so that we really can support homeopathic medicinal products, to have good manufacturing and laboratory practice and to make it possible to choose fantasy names."
"As a research committee, we are of course particularly keen for the Commission also to report on the studies and research which have been carried out to check the effectiveness of homeopathic and other alternative therapies under the Community's biomedical research and development programme."
"Under this fifth framework research programme, and on the basis of the requests made in the report, support should be given to research activities in the field of alternative medicine, with special reference to individual and general procedures, and to the preventive roles and special features of alternative medical disciplines."
"These, of course, include programmes for basic research into homeopathy, to be carried out by bio-medical institutions, designed in particular to explain the process of homeopathic potentisation and prove the efficacy of homeopathic high-level potencies, together with programmes to promote international pooling of the experience of experts in homeopathy."
"This was of quite particular concern to us, since we should also remember that in recent years the demand for homeopathic medicines has risen in most European countries, and that according to the Commission it now accounts for a share of over 1 %, in some countries even over 5 % of the gross sales of the European pharmaceutical industry; I believe we must take that into account in research as well."
"Hence the concern of the Committee on Research, which we are grateful to Mr Chanterie for addressing, with stepping up research in this area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, many of you - and probably many of the people listening to us in the public gallery - will not be users of homeopathic or anthroposophic medicinal products."
"A lot of people are sceptical about their effectiveness and do not believe there is any scientific basis to anthroposophic medicine."
"But 29 % of European citizens have used homeopathic medicines at least once. Many Europeans have faith in therapies described as alternative, complementary or nontraditional."
"Homeopathic product sales are rising, and now account on average for 1 % of sales of medicinal products, with much higher percentages in some countries."
"So it seems only right and proper that we should look at this issue again on the basis of the report the Commission has presented to Parliament on the application of the 1992 Directives."
"With the approval of those directives - as Mr Chanterie reminded us - the European Union guaranteed all citizens access to the medicinal products of their choice. It is intended to prevent discrimination between European citizens depending on the country where they live - some very open, some quite tolerant, some completely anti - and to ensure that safe, high quality medicines are available which provide users with clear and helpful information and instructions."
"These two objectives - access to free choice of medicines for all European citizens together with the necessary guarantees for product safety and correct use - have guided the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which I represent, in the debate and vote on Mr Chanterie's excellent report for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"There were not many problems, but they were serious ones."
"How could registration of a pharmaceutical already registered in another country be made cheaper and less bureaucratic?"
"Should the simplified legislation modify the dilution threshold indicated in the current directive and the recommended methods of taking the medicine?"
"Should it be left to the instructions for use to remind users to consult a doctor while using the product?"
"Or should it be specified, instead, that a doctor need only be consulted if symptoms persist after several days of treatment?"
"Or that people should actually see a doctor before starting the treatment?"
"Should the label state 'homeopathic medicine' without approved therapeutic indications?"
"Or would 'approved homeopathic medicine' be sufficient?"
"The resolution passed in committee is a balanced response to these questions."
"The matter will be considered further if and when the Commission presents a proposal for a directive specifically responding to the questions raised by analysis of the application of the current directive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this report the European Parliament welcomes the Commission's report on the application of Directives 92/73 and 92/74."
"On the legal basis of this directive, homeopathic remedies were recognised for the first time as medicinal products, but this legal act has not been implemented effectively."
"In this opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights calls on the Commission to make use of its right of initiative and to apply its competence in the field of homeopathy."
"There are five points which the Commission should bear in mind if it is to improve the application of the two directives."
"Firstly, it would be desirable to achieve general recognition of homeopathic remedies which are already authorised in another state."
"To that end, the directive must be reworded in a clear and binding manner."
"This alone can prevent countries from exercising arbitrary power as regards the recognition of homeopathic remedies."
"Secondly, special rules for tests and trials should be introduced to ensure free circulation on the market, while at the same time taking account of the need to protect the consumer."
"Thirdly, simplified registration procedures need to be worked out in order to speed up the procedure for recognising homeopathic medicines."
"Here too, account must be taken of consumer protection."
"Fourthly, the simplified registration procedure should be extended to veterinary homeopathic remedies for food-producing animals."
"In taking account of consumer interests, there is no reason to exclude food-producing animals from the possible therapeutic benefits of homeopathic remedies."
"Fifth, we must treat homeopathic and allopathic medicinal products in the same way as regards the use of fantasy names on labels and package inserts."
"Provided it accepts these points, the Commission will in our view be submitting a proposal that deserves consideration."
"Mr President, it is symbolic that, in the space of one year, two European Parliament reports have tackled the subject of unconventional medicines and that now, with the Chanterie report on homeopathic medicinal products, five parliamentary committees have been called upon to give their opinion on the subject."
"This confirms that the European institutions are aware of the importance of their role in improving the quality of public health and intend to do so in response to public practice, given that an increasing number of people are turning to these complementary forms of medicine."
"The European Union can no longer bury its head in the sand, thanks to pressure both from the European Parliament and from members of the public and their organisations."
"The European Parliament has often been a pioneer in tackling controversial or politically sensitive subjects as well as by introducing culture and education into the European Union's remit or debating issues such as genetic engineering, equality or sexual orientation."
"Once again, the European Parliament is leading the way in the process of granting unconventional medicinal products a recognised status."
"It is vital that a social practice affecting about one quarter of the European Union's population, as is the case with the use of homeopathic medicinal products, should find a response in the European institutions. In that way the sector can develop without risk for its users, in fair conditions both for professionals and industrialists."
"It is important not only that the European Union should be willing to do something but also that the Member States should respond. They should proceed with the swiftness that common sense demands and ensure that a common procedure (with mutual recognition) is introduced for registering these medicines and that studies are carried out into homeopathic practice."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"This is a sector which attracts considerable public attention."
"Most people have a view on the subject, and many passionate discussions have taken place on it."
"It might be said that fortunately this passion has so far only been expressed in words."
"These attitudes are also reflected in the ways in which the different countries have tackled the problems and which we must naturally take into account when we are looking at what more we need to do at EU level."
"I shall not go into all the points which the rapporteur has made, but simply present the overall view of the Liberal Group as a guideline for the future work of the Commission and the Council, since that is ultimately what is at issue."
"Firstly, it would be desirable to have greater mutual recognition in practice, but it would then be necessary - and an absolute precondition for such greater mutual recognition - for us to have a knowledge of the method of registration in the individual countries."
"It must be said that we do not have this at the moment."
"So there must be well-documented registration, on a basis which is as scientific as possible."
"And secondly, as I said, this therefore means that we must have a requirement for individual countries to publish their lists of homeopathic medicines and also to explain how they are approved, for example whether they have been approved under Articles 7 and 8, because in that case we have already come a good deal of the way."
"In our opinion, a simplified registration procedure should not be used either for medicines for human use or those for veterinary use, which can enter the food chain."
"Instead, I think that we should consider a positive list of harmless substances and diluents."
"Lastly, fantasy names are fine as far as we are concerned, and there should not be a requirement to consult a doctor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate concerns the Chanterie report on homeopathic medicinal products."
"As a doctor, I would say that, in order for homeopathic medicines to be regarded as useful and effective, they must meet certain conditions regarding their manufacture, approval and use."
"Otherwise, homeopathy will simply be regarded as an unorthodox enterprise practised by charlatans. This would be very harmful to a discipline which is supported by some pharmacists and doctors."
"These conditions are as follows: firstly, a totally clear distinction must be made between homeopathy and anthroposophy."
"However, whether or not Mr Chanterie likes it, anthroposophy is just an example of unorthodox practices trying to jump on the homeopathic bandwagon. This strange mixture has been insidiously introduced by the rapporteur and must be firmly excluded."
"Secondly, the approval of a product must not mean that all the Member States have to accept a medicine which might have been accepted by only one of them, whose laxness could be dangerous and could put patients at risk."
"On the contrary, an assessment must be carried out in each Member State, in accordance with criteria providing full guarantees of quality and harmlessness - all of which, I must stress, is for the protection of patients."
"Fourthly, it is also dangerous to entrust the approval of these medicines to a Community body of 'experts' whose scientific qualifications are not guaranteed by the proposed text."
"Fifthly, the names must be precise."
"We do not agree to fantasy names being used and, in our opinion, the approved therapeutic indication is perfectly adequate."
"Finally, it is essential that homeopathic medicinal products are not prescribed by any supposedly qualified person - and by whom would they be qualified? - but by a doctor, given that many doctors are also homeopaths."
"This is the aim of my amendment which, contrary to the proposed text, advises the user to consult a doctor only if symptoms persist."
"I believe that patients must consult a doctor about using such medicines, in order to prevent an illness such as cancer, for example, going undetected by a medically unqualified prescriber, with a doctor being consulted only after this cancer has spread."
"Patients' lives must not be put in danger."
"Society has spent millions on training professionals: we must therefore be wary of dangerous amateurs."
"Would you trust a pilot who had been trained by any old qualification body, or who had taught himself?"
"To conclude, if these conditions are not clearly expressed in the report, our group will vote against the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, there is still no free market in homeopathic medicinal products in the Union, despite the fact that the directives are already in place and a legal framework was created in 1992."
"So Mr Chanterie's report quite properly advocates a revision of these directives based on a thorough evaluation of the status quo ."
"Implementation of the directive varies from one Member State to another, and the Commission has even seen fit to refer the question to the Court of Justice because the directives were only partially being carried out in Belgium, France, Portugal and the UK."
"And it is easy to see why."
"In some countries, Belgium among them, the value of homeopathic medicines and whether or not they should be recognised remains a matter of heated debate."
"Moreover, the wording of the directives is so vague, de jure , that differing interpretations are inevitable, and in effect they are not stringent enough to prevent distortions of competition."
"Thus the report quite rightly argues in favour of a new text which precludes any difficulties of interpretation and is binding in nature."
"This will be helpful not only to manufacturers, but to doctors and consumers too."
"Discriminatory statements on the label must be avoided and, on the other hand, the instruction to consult a doctor if symptoms persist must be given not only for homoeopathic medicines, but for conventional medicines as well."
"We wholeheartedly endorse the objectives of the report and also the specific recommendations it makes on registration procedures and a definitive system of coordination and harmonisation."
"We do have reservations though, Mr Chanterie, about paragraph 7 of the recommendations, namely the obligation on Member States to recognise registrations carried out, or authorisations granted, prior to the devising of a system of coordination."
"We agree that work is needed to determine the conditions under which national approval should be recognised by other Member States."
"But pending harmonisation and coordination, it does not seem to us to make too much sense to force mutual recognition on Member States, because that really would make for abuses and laxity."
"It may of course be seen as a means of exerting pressure, but it may lead to abuse, and that really does not serve the consumer interest."
"Mr President, the Commission report points to the need for a decision to amend the directives in question."
"Some Member States treat existing authorisations or registrations not as they should, but as they see fit."
"Treating them as they see fit often means in practice ignoring them."
"A considerable amount of time and money is wasted as a result."
"Each Member State has different procedures for assessing the effects and harmful effects of homoeopathic medicines."
"It is thus desirable that the relevant directives should be amended."
"I understand the reluctance to treat homeopathic medicinal products in the same way as allopathic ones."
"They should not be treated in the same way, because they are based on different understandings of human health, disease and healing."
"Homeopathy takes a holistic view of human health, and I think that is inherently a sound approach."
"Now that the action of certain substances in homeopathic medicinal products has been scientifically demonstrated, the charge that the effects of homeopathic medicines are all in the mind has lost much of its validity."
"I am therefore in favour of a more equal status for homeopathy and allopathy."
"A first step we need to take is more widespread use of the simplified registration procedure."
"It is important that Member States should be free to decide for themselves when a homeopathic medicine qualifies for this procedure."
"We cannot allow the free availability of homeopathic medicines to be curtailed by all manner of unrealistic fears and powerful opposition lobbies."
"I also think it would be a good idea to see if we can agree on a system of mutual recognition."
"I am most interested here in the money this would save."
"We should of course need clear criteria as a basis for that recognition."
"It would make it easier to interpret the relevant directives."
"I compliment Mr Chanterie on his report."
"Mr President, I have to admit that I have found it very difficult to take a firm position in an argument which is still very obscure and difficult to assess."
"It is also true that when we are discussing health we ought to avoid Khomeini-like positions, because research has often overturned received wisdom."
"Yet we cannot disregard one fundamental concept that has been stated for many years in pharmacology and medical text books in the European Community and throughout the rest of the world, which is that the patient should be treated with the maximum dose for the minimum possible time."
"This concept is overturned and denied by homeopathy, which maintains a very low - infinitesimal - dose for a prolonged period."
"It is true that these concepts are, like all science, not fixed in stone, but it is equally clear that science needs to find an answer not only for the authorities, but above all for consumers, and that answer must reconcile those two facts."
"In particular, science needs to clarify the immunity problem arising from a possible choice between conventional and homeopathic during treatment."
"Some maintain that prolonged low doses divert the immune system so that it is unable to deal with anything else, which is a serious threat to health."
"Other scientists challenge that assertion, claiming that an infinitesimal dose does not stimulate the immune response."
"Obviously we are not scientific researchers in a position to clarify these concepts, so we need, and we should be able to expect, clear answers from research. There are also some questions from Professor Cabrol to be answered if homeopathy is to be dignified as a medical science proper."
"I do have some comments on Mr Chanterie's excellent report, in which, like Professor Cabrol, some passages left me very perplexed."
"My first point is that standards for the authorisation and registration of pharmaceuticals differ from one Member State to another."
"Of course we think harmonisation is essential but it must not mean any reduction in the present levels of safety and protection of health."
"Secondly, Chapters IV and V of Directive 92/75 on principles and guidelines for good production and laboratory practices must also be applied in full to all homeopathic medicinal products."
"Thirdly, the Member States must draw up the lists of homeopathic medicines or themselves take responsibility for banning them."
"Fourthly, until it is scientifically proven that homeopathic medicinal products for veterinary use do not involve risks to human health, we think the simplified registration procedure is inapplicable. Tinctures in particular must be subject to rigorous scientific tests to establish what degrees of dilution guarantee the safety of the food chain and protection from contaminated preparations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my job as a pharmacist means that I often come in contact with the question of homeopathy."
"As you know, patients - in other words the consumers - are reacting more and more positively to these medicinal products in Europe."
"It is up to us in this House to accompany and support this trend by preparing adequate legislation."
"Mr Chanterie has indicated the most important aspects in his report, for which I am very grateful."
"In my view, mutual recognition of registrations and authorisations in the Member States of the European Union is important, as is extending the forms of use to parenteral administration, while adhering to the stringent conditions governing quality and safety tests for the consumer which are already in force now."
"We have scientific studies and decades of experience of the harmlessness of these products."
"This brings me to the next important point, which also played a central part in the opinion drawn up by our Committee on Research, namely research."
"Surely we cannot keep bringing up the argument we have just heard about the lack of a scientific basis while at the same time excluding homeopathy de facto from EU-supported projects."
"We already have a considerable number of scientific reports on the subject, and we should further develop and support these initiatives."
"We must ensure that homeopathy is given an equal place in future in the fifth framework research programme."
"Let me say in conclusion that I have learned from numerous conversations with colleagues in the veterinary field that it is essential to organic farming that we no longer exclude homeopathic medicinal products for food-producing animals from the simplified registration procedure."
"Mr President, homeopathic medicine has been officially recognised in certain Member States for many years but has been barely tolerated in others."
"Thus, the Commission, by means of Directives 92/73 and 92/74, created a legal framework allowing patients access to the products of their choice while providing precautions to ensure the quality and safety of the products."
"However, there have been problems with the implementation of this in certain Member States and thus the Commission's current approach is welcome."
"I also welcome this report by Mr Chanterie."
"It is really important that we deal with this issue because of the increasing popularity of homeopathic products in particular and of natural and alternative medicine in general."
"Citizens throughout Europe have a right to have these products circulating freely in the Member States under single market rules as much as any other product, provided that all considerations of safety and efficacy are properly applied."
"In this regard, it would be very useful if we followed up questions of research under the Fifth Framework Programme and the Green Group has introduced amendments to that effect under the Fifth Framework Programme and in the budget."
"So I hope the Commission takes note that the instruments are there by which we could carry out testing and make sure that the harmonisation of homeopathic medicinal products with therapeutic indications is properly tested."
"In other words, given the particular problems surrounding the proving of homeopathy as against allopathic medicine, the pecular requirements of homeopathy should be taken into consideration in this testing and the expert knowledge of homeopaths applied."
"We have the instruments available."
"I have tabled certain amendments."
"In the UK and Ireland these registered practitioners are not only doctors and it is incumbent on us to make clear in the report that where a physician or a doctor has to be referred to on the labelling requirements, this refers to a homeopathic doctor or a registered medical homeopathic practitioner."
"That is the law in my Member State and in the UK and we wish to continue that practice."
"That is why I commend my amendment to you."
"Mr President, the Commission is grateful for the keen interest shown in our report, and especially for the rapporteur's efforts."
"Our intention in choosing this rather unusual procedure, namely drafting a report in order to spark off a broad debate instead of proposing to amend the two directives which are in force, was to clarify the positions of Parliament and the Council."
"Parliament has clarified its position today with its report and this debate."
"We thank it for doing so, and will no doubt be hearing the corresponding views of the Council in the near future."
"Let me begin my reply with a general consideration."
"We did not intend to embark on a discussion of principle during this debate, in other words should homeopathic medicinal products be regarded as medicinal products and, if so, under what conditions?"
"Or should we only recognise allopathic medicinal products?"
"The widespread use of homeopathic medicinal products gives us good reason to concern ourselves with them."
"We cannot simply assume that they are a sideline or something rather esoteric only used by certain sects; in fact, patients use them generally as one kind of medicinal product among others."
"We cannot ignore that."
"It is a fact of life!"
"But the Commission also believes that the concept of science, which has been used by some speakers in this debate too, is somewhat apodictic, because traditional medical science, which researches, produces and evaluates non-homeopathic medicinal products, sets its own conditions."
"The concept of science implies that for anything to be scientifically recognised it must first be clarified by being defined."
"On the basis of the methods and procedures that are applied, we can judge whether something is scientific or not."
"But that is a very narrow definition."
"Mrs Heinisch is quite right to say that the concept of science can of course be defined much more broadly, so that other phenomena which do not fit into this traditional, orthodox definition of science come within its scope."
"In our view, the main problem in this discussion of principle is that there happen to be doctors, scientists and chemists who want to apply this narrow definition of science and therefore say that because this is the case and because homeopathic medicinal products do not fall within this definition, we believe that we should not concern ourselves with them."
"We think that is wrong, as we have made clear from the outset, because when you take the three characteristics of medicinal products - safety, efficacy and quality - you will find that we have not made efficacy a condition for homeopathic medicinal products."
"That, however, does not mean - and it would be wrong to draw this as a logical conclusion - that a homeopathic medicinal product is not effective; it only means that efficacy is not a condition for its recognition as a medicinal product."
"We all know that it is effective and that many people can expect and even achieve good results, not so much from any direct and verifiable chemical effects, but more from the psychological - although that is too narrow a definition too - let us say from the overall effects of this product."
"That covers many things."
"I think listening to agreeable debates with pleasant Members of the European Parliament is an example of the homeopathic doses which Commissioners would sometimes find most welcome."
"We also know that the current state of affairs is not satisfactory."
"As we heard during the debate, a number of Member States have done nothing at all, so we must do more."
"So this exchange of ideas is very helpful."
"Overall, the report takes the same line we did."
"So we have no problem with it; on the contrary, we feel supported, and in the follow-up I am sure we will move in the direction that Mr Chanterie and other speakers indicated."
"That is to say, we should define the conditions for mutual recognition of registered homeopathic products more carefully and then make mutual recognition a binding principle."
"It is quite clear that mutual recognition is possible only if we lay down the minimum conditions under which this recognition is binding."
"That is why the obligation of mutual recognition must go hand in hand with a more carefully defined simplified registration procedure."
"It could be very helpful in this regard to draw up harmonised lists of degrees of dilution, for example, and to clarify the field of application of the simplified authorisation procedure."
"I also agree that there is no reason to maintain the ban on registering veterinary homeopathic medicinal products for foodproducing animals."
"Some of the provisions on labelling could also be reworded and made more consumer-friendly."
"Obviously that includes dosages, but also provisions on names."
"This can and must be improved, because totally misleading fantasy names are just as harmful as meaningless descriptions that nobody can understand."
"We are also in favour of making the provisions of Article 9(2) binding, i.e. introducing special provisions on tests and trials."
"We do not agree with the following points of the report."
"In their present form, the directives cover all homeopathic products and preparation processes."
"We have not listed the various schools of homeopathy that exist in this area separately, and for a good reason."
"In my view, to enter into that kind of doctrinal dispute would be more likely to be damaging for homeopathic medicinal products."
"That is why we do not understand why only one of these schools, anthroposophic homeopathy, should be mentioned separately in the text of the directives."
"This does not mean we are against anthroposophy, it simply means that we do not wish to become involved in this doctrinal dispute."
"In our view, that would be going a little too far."
"As Mr Chanterie can imagine, the Commission is certainly sympathetic to the idea of a Community body which would be responsible for authorisation and assessment, including the question of labelling."
"After all, we have had extremely good experiences with the London agency for the authorisation of medicinal products."
"We shall consider whether a similar body could be set up."
"Of course, that would require the cooperation of the Member States."
"So we are saying quite clearly, as your report does, that the directives need to be supplemented and improved and we thank Parliament for its proposals."
"We now await the Council's opinion."
"As soon as we have it, we shall set to work."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Liability for defective products"
"The next item is the report (A4-0326/98) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (COM(97)0478 - C4-0503/97-97/0244(COD))."
"Mr President, I never seem to quite get away from this unending BSE business."
"Although the subject is an entirely different one today, we are still feeling the painful aftermath of the BSE scandal in the European Union."
"In the report by its committee of inquiry, the European Parliament called on the Commission to include primary agricultural products in the European Union's product liability directive, which has been in force since 1985."
"Parliament did this to ensure that if a case comparable to the BSE scandal came up again, the citizens of Europe would have product liability."
"The Commission has complied with this obligation by indeed including primary agricultural products."
"But the Commission did not follow this line through to the end."
"It usually does so, Mr Monti, I am convinced of that, but this time it did not do so."
"Because just including agricultural products in the associated question of product liability is not enough to deal with the BSE crisis; this must be supplemented by a number of follow-up amendments to the product liability directive."
"The Commission has not done this."
"I have done it as rapporteur."
"I have altered the liability ceiling, because the level we had in the past was not high enough to deal with a scandal such as BSE and the harm done to humans."
"I have also amended the limitation period, the deadline by which claims can be lodged, because the ten-year period which has hitherto applied does not even take account of the incubation period of the new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"Moreover, I have not reversed the burden of proof, as some perhaps less legally informed people might have imagined; instead, I have linked the burden of proof to the product."
"I have introduced the concept of prima-facie evidence, since there is no alternative in the case of a product which might have been consumed a number of years ago and can therefore no longer be produced as solid evidence."
"I have also added a few words on the development risk, which had in fact been proposed in the Commission's original directive in 1985, but was not accepted by the Council at the time and is therefore made optional in the directive."
"The Member States can incorporate it if they wish."
"Now there are some people in this Parliament and in European industry who believe that what I am doing is not legally necessary and is not correct."
"They are wrong on both counts!"
"If we want to cope with the BSE scandal and any similar situation, we have to make further amendments, in addition to including primary products."
"Anyone who disputes that is in effect unwilling to admit that we must do more if a case like BSE comes up again."
"The Commission is doing one thing: it is pursing its lips, but you are not whistling, Mr Monti."
"However, I would like to hear you whistle."
"Perhaps you could do so here tonight."
"May I also say that what I propose is already quite normal in many Member States."
"There is no ceiling on liability in any of the Member States apart from three."
"Indeed two Member States - Finland and Luxembourg - have even gone so far as to exclude the argument of development risk."
"In all the other countries, except for my own and Spain and Portugal, there is no ceiling on liability."
"Moreover, in Spain for example, it is not possible to argue on the basis of the development risk in respect of foodstuffs."
"Interestingly enough, that is just what we are talking about here."
"And in any case, all the Member States have special rules on the development risk of medicinal products."
"So I cannot quite see how the European industry lobby - which has my full support, because I too want to see a fully functioning industry - was clearly able to 'persuade' some Members of this Parliament, and others too, firmly enough to make them really believe that the Commission's amendment can accomplish what Parliament has called for."
"It cannot."
"I am convinced that the question of the ceiling on liability, the question of the deadline for lodging claims and the question of the development risk can perhaps be treated differently."
"I and a colleague from another group have tabled some compromise amendments for the plenary in order to offer Members of both Parliament and the Commission an alternative."
"But we cannot in my view do any less."
"This European Parliament cannot afford that, not after what we have achieved, both vis-à-vis and versus the Commission, in relation to BSE."
"Anyone who does less here today or tomorrow will not be living up to what we have achieved in recent years, and will find it difficult to justify this before the European public next year."
"I am convinced that at this first reading, we must at least accept in codecision procedure the text that will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow."
"Mr Monti, I would like to hear you say that you regard this as a good startingpoint and will support these proposals."
"Mr President, in view of its positive impact on consumer protection, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights welcomes the proposal for a directive, which, by widening the scope of producers' liability for defective products to cover all movables, extends the 1985 Directive to include agricultural products."
"But the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has expressed reservations, and continues to do so, about the admissibility of the amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection for the following reasons. First, in the light of Rules 124(2) and 125(1)(a) of the Rules of Procedure taken in conjunction with Article 138(2) of the Treaty, the committee believes the European Parliament cannot covertly deprive the Commission of the exclusive right to initiate legislation through amendments to the legislative proposal."
"If Parliament considers that a legislative act should be amended, it is entitled to ask the Commission to submit the requisite proposals."
"Secondly, the proposal for a directive gives full effect to Parliament's recommendation set out in the report of 7 February 1997 by the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"Thirdly, the 1985 Directive has radically altered, if only in terms of producers' liability, certain key points of private law laid down in the Member States, namely civil liability, the burden of proof, compensation for damages, and time-barring of rights."
"The approaches proposed in the directive to deal with these points are still valid, since they take proper account of all the interests at stake, striking a rational balance between the different views of the parties concerned."
"So the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights believes the amendments from the Committee on the Environment are inadmissible because they exceed Parliament's right to amend a proposal from the Commission."
"Besides, in our opinion, these amendments are unacceptable in substance."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights considers that no substantial amendment of Directive 85/374 should be put forward until the Commission has held detailed discussions with the other Community institutions, the Member States and the relevant private individuals."
"This proposal could be made after examination of the Commission's forthcoming report on the implementation of Directive 85/374, due to be published in the year 2000."
"In conclusion, we are in favour of the directive but, for strictly legal reasons, we cannot agree to the amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House wanted this legislative proposal and with just cause."
"The BSE scandal forced us to ask the European Commission to present a proposal, as quickly as possible, extending the scope of the basic directive to primary products, i.e. products of the soil, stock-farming or fisheries, and game."
"We cannot now refuse this extension, particularly in view of the extreme consumer distrust of food products and the increasing industrialisation of agricultural production methods."
"In any case, zero risk does not exist and as producers know that, when placing products on the market, they are running a risk and may be making the consumer run a risk, the latter must have a right of redress in the event of injury."
"It is true that it would be unfair for agricultural products to escape this general rule."
"Consumers must enjoy the same protection, whatever the nature of the defective product."
"It should be recalled that, in the case of liability without fault, what counts is the act of placing a product on the market; it is not a question of determining who is guilty but who is liable."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is well aware of this, particularly as society needs to come to terms with its agricultural sector and as, in any case, the very existence of such a system will surely act as an incentive to the placing of safe, healthy and high-quality products on the market."
"This proposal is therefore acceptable to the Agriculture Committee. However, the specific nature of agricultural products must not be forgotten and we have therefore proposed certain amendments, some of which, we are pleased to say, have been adopted."
"However, we regret that other amendments have not been adopted: firstly, because of the heavy dependence of primary agricultural production on external factors, we proposed including a clause dealing with this specific characteristic and suspending the directive's application to agricultural products in the case of damage resulting from natural disasters or other cases of force majeure ."
"We also thought that such a system should not be used in any way as an instrument of unfair trade by the customers (and sometimes the exclusive customers) of agricultural producers."
"During the assessment that will have to be made of the directive, specifically with regard to the agricultural and rural sectors, I hope that proposals will be made in this respect, as the specific characteristics of agriculture will then be clearly apparent to everyone."
"In general, regarding the directive as a whole, our group - I am speaking on behalf of the ARE Group here - cannot support Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposal which we unfortunately see as a reversal of the burden of proof."
"There is no doubt that it is the victim who must provide proof of the harm caused by a clearly identified product."
"On the other hand, our group agrees with the rapporteur that the period of liability should be longer than the ten years provided for by the Commission."
"Finally, our group also supports Mrs Roth-Behrendt in questioning the exemption from liability on the basis of development risks. This exemption, in our opinion, is not justified in the context of the strict principle of liability without fault, linked to the act of placing a product on the market."
"Mr President, I do not want to follow the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights in their discussion of whether this report is in order or not."
"My colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt is probably as good a lawyer as anyone on the Legal Affairs Committee and it is right that she has tried to make substantial amendments to the proposal from the Commission."
"That does not mean, however, that all of us on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection follow her entirely down that road."
"The reason is quite simple."
"There are advantages and disadvantages to the position in which Mrs Roth-Behrendt and those of us, like the last speaker, who were previously on the Temporary Committee investigating BSE, find ourselves."
"Because of Mr Medina's report we had the opportunity in a crisis situation to bring forward one simple reform."
"That was to add primary products to the products which would be subject to this directive."
"Given what we learned in the BSE scandal and given what we now know about the dangers that may linger for many years in primary products, it is surely right that the Commission bring forward this proposal and that we seek to improve it as best we can."
"Where I need to express a slightly divergent view is in whether our efforts to improve and extend it have been over-expansive."
"I would agree with the rapporteur in her view that the ten-year limit is not enough and also that the initial limits set on the amount of damages were inadequate considering the context in which this report came forward, namely the horrors of the BSE scandal."
"So I am in favour of that section of the amendments."
"I commend Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the attempt she made at a late hour to bring in compromises."
"My difficulties - and she knows this - are with the burden of proof as set out in these amendments and also on the question of development risk."
"As far as burden of proof is concerned, looking now at Amendment No 12, if you say that a causal relationship can be proved if it is shown to be sufficiently likely, I am not sure where between the causal and the casual that leaves you."
"The problem is that however difficult it may be to prove damages, you have to be able to show that a given product supplied by a given producer brought about this effect."
"You may need more time to do it but you cannot just say that it is down to inference."
"That is one of the problems with Amendment No 12 as it stands."
"My last point is that on development risk we suffer from the fact that this is an emergency measure that we have brought in with great speed."
"The problem is that we need to look very carefully at the Member States and at their liability laws is to see where development risk leads us if it is included or excluded."
"That is more appropriately done in the review in the year 2000."
"Having said all that, representing I suspect a minority view on the Environment Committee, I greatly admire the work that the rapporteur has done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have to discuss the extension to agricultural products of the scope of Directive 85/374/EEC on liability for defective products."
"The Commission's proposal is welcome because it responds to a request from Parliament following the BSE crisis and also because it avoids the problem of having to define processed products and agricultural products which was encountered in the implementation of this directive."
"The problem is Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report."
"Under the pretext of generosity and using the emotions raised by the BSE crisis, she has completely altered the basis of the 1985 directive by reversing the burden of proof, deleting the scientific development clause, removing or extending the deadline for action by victims, etc."
"The rapporteur's proposals alter the balance between consumer protection and legal certainty for economic operators."
"Mrs RothBehrendt has certainly encountered many problems - the debate on this report has itself been postponed several times - and she has tried to water down her proposals."
"She is now proposing supposedly compromise amendments, but where is the compromise?"
"There has been no compromise with other political groups and some amendments are only supported by 29 Members."
"This is just a case of currying favour in the run-up to an election campaign. However, consumers are responsible people, many being producers themselves, and they know that the balance of the 1985 directive must not be altered."
"There is also a risk that the courts will be flooded with cases and will have difficulty in legally interpreting the majority of the amendments which are, to say the least, contradictory and vague."
"Also, has anyone calculated the financial implications of Mrs Roth-Behrendt's amendments?"
"These implications are out of all proportion and we cannot imagine the consequences, not only for growth industries such as medicines and research, but also for all our SMEs and SMIs, and our farmers who have been the subject of much discussion in this House today."
"For goodness' sake let us wait for the Commission to produce its Green Paper on the application of the directive."
"We know that the Commission must bring this Green Paper before us after wide consultations with the partners involved, and we also know that this Green Paper must be brought before us by 1 January 2000 at the latest."
"I would ask the Commission to inform us whether it intends to meet this deadline, although I realise, of course, that 1 January 2000 is not far off."
"It seems that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has completely neglected to consult the partners in this respect."
"Therefore, for all these reasons which I believe are particularly serious, the Group of the European People's Party would prefer that we should not act in haste and that we should decide not to rush into changing the substance of such a sensitive directive."
"This is why the PPE Group will vote against all Mrs Roth-Behrendt's amendments."
"Mr President, Parliament's proposal to extend the scope of the directive to include primary agricultural products is a welcome move."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, like the ambitious politician that she is, has used the occasion to include some other issues in her report."
"I think we can take the liberty of doing the same, since it is a way for us to influence policy."
"I should therefore like to make the following comments."
"We support the proposal to raise the total amount of liability from ECU 70 million to ECU 140 million, as stated in the final amendment."
"We also support, in principle, the extension of the deadline for claiming compensation on account of the length of the incubation period."
"The proposal on the burden of proof which, while not actually reversing the present position, provides for a different arrangement, is perfectly acceptable."
"We need to support the man in the street against the big companies."
"On the other hand, we do not really know how such a change will affect the industry."
"The same thing applies in the case of risk-development."
"The industry, as well as producers, needs to know how to proceed when it develops new products."
"It should be possible to take certain risks, otherwise there would never be any progress."
"Neither of these proposals has been adequately explored in the Roth-Behrendt report."
"I would therefore like to refer to Amendment No 9, where we specify that every five years the Commission is to present a report to Parliament and the Council."
"This should be done no later than the end of the year 2000, with a view to carrying out a general revision of the directive."
"I hope that the Commission will take note of this discussion and the proposal - even if it is not approved - and that its implications are looked into."
"We shall then be able to discuss it again in the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a European Commission proposal which aims to extend the Community provisions on no-fault liability for defective products to primary agricultural products and game."
"Firstly, I must say that the rapporteur has exceeded her brief because she has completely taken over a legislative initiative."
"She would actually like to rewrite all the provisions on defective products, and not just agricultural products, which does not seem to me to be very fair, particularly as the European Commission is preparing a review of this directive on defective products for next year and particularly as certain Member States, such as France, have only just transposed the general directive into their own laws."
"The rapporteur also wants to take over and alter certain conditions already laid down in the previous directive."
"I will highlight just two of these: firstly, the rapporteur wants to remove the concept of objective liability, which would mean that the person injured by the defective product would no longer have to prove the causal relationship between the defect in the product and the damage in order for the producer's liability to be incurred."
"Secondly, she wants to challenge the clause excluding the so-called 'development risk', which means that a producer would be regarded as liable even if the state of scientific and technical knowledge, at the moment when the product was put into circulation, did not in any way allow him to detect this defect."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, if you gave a product to your children and you realised later that it was defective, even though you had no proof, would you still change all that?"
"This exclusion clause has been adopted by some Member States in order to develop their pharmaceutical research potential."
"The removal of this exclusion clause by the European Parliament would cause European research and innovation to be relocated to competing countries which have not accepted such a provision or which still offer incentives."
"This would lead to a delay in certain medicines becoming available for use by citizens of the European Union and a potential refusal by insurance companies to cover this risk."
"Furthermore, this exclusion clause was enshrined in law by the Court of Justice in a decision of 29 May 1998."
"Not to include this clause seemed unrealistic and unreasonable to the Court at the time."
"The maintenance of the clause is also justified as it does not leave the injured person without any redress, since the latter will be able to rely on rights recognised under the contractual, extracontractual or social liability systems, i.e. Article 13 of the Directive of 25 July 1985."
"Because of these two amendments and many others which I will not mention, all of which, we should remember, fall outside the scope of the brief entrusted to Mrs Roth-Behrendt - given that the rapporteur has taken over the European Commission's right of legislative initiative - amendments which would no longer protect consumers but which would seriously threaten producers and could have serious repercussions on some countries' precarious economies and on employment, our group will not vote for Mrs Roth-Behrendt's amendments."
"Mr President, our group was pleased with the Commission's proposal but even more so with Mrs RothBehrendt's extremely high-quality and courageous report, because it is likely to be the only one to draw the logical conclusions from the BSE scandal."
"This makes it all the more regrettable that the majority of Members of the European Parliament will not endorse the rapporteur's views and that they, and especially the large political groups, are allowing themselves to be misled by the industry."
"I simply cannot understand the arguments which have just been put forward about the financial risk to undertakings."
"If agriculture says it wants to be regarded as a form of undertaking, it must behave accordingly!"
"Surely the point here with regard to liability is to create an instrument to ensure that industry and agriculture finally live up to their own responsibilities."
"After all, we must not create indirect subsidies here by exempting these undertakings from the obligation."
"Surely the principle of a constitutional state is that the potential victims - who are the consumers - are better protected than the potential offenders, who are after all the industry!"
"When we talk about strict liability, that should have meant no longer allowing any excuses."
"It should have meant protection for the consumer."
"What is being planned now waters down the report."
"However, it is still better than the current practice, which is why we shall endorse it with a heavy heart, but it is not an improvement for the consumer."
"On the contrary, it means that in future lawyers will be able to line their pockets nicely, which is why I think it is such a pity that we cannot manage finally to carry forward what we keep calling for, namely consumer protection and the preventive principle, together with the acceptance of responsibility on the part of the industry which is also constantly being called for."
"Let me once again warmly congratulate the rapporteur, who has made a truly great effort, but I find the compromise amendments very watered down."
"It is a pity that we as the European Parliament will not succeed here in really putting consumer protection first."
"I think that would have been the least that we in Parliament could have tried to do."
"Mrs Grossetête and Mr Olsson, we cannot just keep representing the interests of the industry."
"We should have tried - and I hope you will realise this by tomorrow's vote - really to put consumer protection and the potential victims first."
"Mr President, the latest reports tell us of new cases of BSE."
"Consumers are thus increasingly concerned about the quality of meat."
"In view of that, it is a good thing that we are addressing the subject today."
"After all, it was the BSE crisis which prompted the proposal to amend Directive 85/374."
"The Commission proposal seeks to resolve the problem of the continuing lack of liability for primary products in agriculture, and I welcome it."
"Farm producers are liable for the quality of their products, just like their fellow producers in other industries."
"Product liability for primary products encourages farmers to act responsibly."
"The proposed changes also remove the lack of clarity about when a product has undergone first processing or transformation."
"The rapporteur calls for liability to be extended to primary agricultural products, but also for a number of weaknesses in the existing directive to be addressed."
"Since we are looking to amend this directive now, I think we should deal with these defects straight away whilst we are about it."
"It will avoid duplication."
"I compliment the rapporteur on her attention to detail here."
"The amendments proposed provide better protection for the consumer, and they are less spectacular than many producer reactions would have us believe."
"In some Member States, the changes in question were made a long time ago."
"I am in favour of those changes, because I think the position of consumers and producers should be the same."
"That makes the single market work better."
"Finally, I should like to explore one of the changes in greater detail using an illustration."
"Under the current directive, it is possible for a consumer to buy a washing machine which floods out his entire kitchen."
"The consumer can claim that the machine is defective and that he has sustained a loss, and he can point to a causal link between the loss and the defect."
"But he cannot obtain compensation, because the manufacturer has already reached his total liability ceiling for compensation."
"The consumer is just unlucky in being not the first, but the umpteenth claimant."
"This kind of thing has to be made impossible."
"I therefore believe that the total liability ceiling should be abolished."
"Mr President, I entirely agree with the rapporteur that the consumer is entitled to total protection which covers the entire food chain and is not effective only after a certain processing stage."
"In other words, I welcome the amendment to the product liability directive proposed by the Commission following the BSE crisis, which is designed to extend its scope to primary agricultural products."
"On the other hand, I do not agree with the proposals and amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, because they overstep the mark."
"I cannot judge how far the committee was aware of the adverse and unpredictable effects which they would have on the economy, especially on small and medium-sized enterprises and on agriculture, or of the fact that this would represent an intervention in national civil law which has no basis in fact and is in some ways contrary to the system."
"Here I would have preferred to see a different approach."
"I am thinking of the problems of the burden of proof, a question that has been addressed by a number of speakers, of the development risk and also of abolishing the limit on liability."
"I also believe that the rapporteur's approach underlines the legitimacy of the proposals made by the Austrian Minister of Justice, Mr Michalik, at the informal Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs last week, whereby the Justice and Home Affairs Council should also consider judicial matters discussed in other Councils so that it can tackle this kind of legal problem."
"We cannot endorse the rapporteur's proposals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt's brief was extremely difficult."
"She had to meet the expectations of Parliament and public opinion with regard to the unhappy events of the BSE crisis. It was clear that simply updating the 1985 directive by including primary agricultural products would not be enough to meet those expectations."
"It is to be regretted that the Commission did not take the initiative in listing the points which needed to be updated quickly, in order to take this unhappy experience into account."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt did list these points. At the start of the discussions in committee, some proposals which we did not feel were sufficiently balanced were thrown out."
"These related to concerns which affect us all: maintaining consumer protection, which is the main priority, and also ensuring that producers do not fall victim to random events and an unfair and systematic anti-producer attitude."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt has tried to achieve reconciliation and compromise."
"She was keen to try and make progress which would not challenge the original balance of the 1985 directive."
"In the main, I consider that her proposals are good but I do have two reservations."
"We will not vote for Amendment No 12 on the burden of proof as it is ambiguous."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt does stress in her explanation that it does not involve a reversal of the burden of proof, but we feel that the phrases which aim to facilitate the protection of consumers and injured people are too vague in legal terms."
"I am particularly thinking of the phrase: 'it shall suffice for the injured person to prove that the damage occurred and for the causal relationship to be sufficiently probable'."
"Under French law, the concept of 'probable' does not exist and is difficult to define in my opinion."
"I must also just say that the deadline problem cannot be avoided and that, even though the wording of Amendment No 13 on the definition of the hidden defect or the hidden fault needs to be improved, the idea of allowing the deadline to be extended, although only in certain very specific cases, seems to me to be necessary. At first reading, therefore, Parliament must stress its desire for dialogue in order to achieve a situation which is satisfactory to everyone."
"Mr President, to begin with I must compliment Mrs Roth-Behrendt for having shown great creativity and inventiveness, as befits a true parliamentarian, in probing every last aspect of the proposal which the European Commission has put to us."
"That means of course that unexpected problems may arise."
"I do not really agree with those members of the Legal Affairs Committee who say that some amendments are inadmissible."
"Why do I disagree?"
"Because I think that the European Parliament, by virtue of having always probed every last aspect of a situation, has also managed to resolve a good many of those situations."
"That is one point."
"Turning to the substance, as I said just now, some things may be a case of a bridge too far."
"I fully endorse the Commission's proposal that primary agricultural products should also be covered by the directive, and I think Mrs Roth-Behrendt can be pleased that the findings of her BSE committee will thus have been implemented accordingly."
"What we have here is a product liability directive which in 1985 - and I have taken a look back at the negotiations - left very little room for manoeuvre."
"It is these limits which the rapporteur, and Parliament too, I think, is now coming up against."
"Naturally there are a few problems."
"The points which the rapporteur made about shifting the burden of proof, who bears the full development risk and extending the period of liability, for example, are all problems which need to be resolved."
"This does not mean we can do that now, because I think our various group discussions of the proposal have shown that a number of amendments in their current form are not yet quite as they need to be."
"It means that we shall need to look at this proposal again. I would ask the rapporteur to incorporate into the proposal of the Legal Affairs Committee a deadline, a point in time for assessing whether further progress can be made through due debate, and whether further changes are necessary and desirable."
"Mr President, I have two basic quarrels with the draft report which has been presented and the amendments which have been put down."
"The first is a formal objection."
"I refer to the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee which says that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur concerning the substance are inadmissible."
"Not because we as the European Parliament must curtail our own powers, but because the institutional balance between the European institutions has to be preserved."
"We have to know our limitations in life."
"My second objection concerns the substance."
"We welcome the extension of product liability to primary agricultural products, but the rest of the proposed changes to the draft directive go very deep, and I wonder if thought has been given to their consequences."
"I wonder if proper prior consideration has been given to the concrete repercussions of the proposed amendments, for example as regards the burden of proof, the time limit for proceedings, the absence of any financial threshold or a ceiling on total liability for compensation."
"I fear that stricter measures may have quite the opposite effect to what is desired."
"Tighter rules on liability will discourage producers from bringing goods on to the market unless there is total certainty that they are entirely safe."
"As a result, it will be the consumer who suffers, because business innovation and therefore progress too are likely to be substantially inhibited."
"After all, what firm is going to invest in research and development without insurance against the development risk?"
"Our firms will become a little less competitive in world markets as a result, and this again may cost jobs."
"For all these reasons, I hesitate to endorse the findings of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"On the substance too, we have to know our limitations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while considering the extension of the directive on liability for defective products to primary agricultural products and game, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection thought it advisable to adopt certain amendments, taking over provisions which were fiercely discussed during preparatory work on the original directive, but were ultimately rejected."
"I am thinking in particular of the reversal of the burden of proof and the deletion of the clause excluding the development risk."
"We have two main objections here, one on legal grounds and the other on the substance and also for economic reasons."
"Firstly, there is legitimate doubt about the validity of the manoeuvre to alter the 1985 directive instead of confining ourselves to the proposal for a directive submitted to us by the Commission."
"Of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, those numbered 2 to 9 relate to this original directive, and not to the directive proposed by Parliament and the Council which has been submitted to us."
"By adopting these amendments, Parliament would actually be taking the legislative initiative which, until proven to the contrary, is an area over which the Commission has a monopoly."
"With regard to the substance, it is clear that the amendments tabled would create an unreasonable imbalance in contractual relations and would burden enterprises with charges, particularly insurance charges for SMEs, which some could not support."
"As for the compromise amendments, these are scarcely any more acceptable."
"On the one hand they introduce a concept which is legally very dubious, i.e. the probable causal relationship concept which could be a source of many disputes, and, on the other hand, they significantly increase the charges on enterprises by doubling the duration of the period of limitation and the amount of the liability threshold."
"Finally, we could ask why there is such a rush. Is there no time even to wait for the Commission's Green Paper on the application of the 1985 directive?"
"All these reasons mean that we will not be voting for Mrs Roth-Behrendt's amendments."
"Mr President, I should first like to express my support for what my colleague Mrs Grossetête has said, and then to indicate that I totally support the European Commission's proposal for the scope of this directive to be extended to include products derived from agriculture and stock breeding, in the hope of providing better consumer protection."
"On the other hand, however, we cannot support the proposals contained in the rapporteur's report. As many of my colleagues have already explained, we do not think there is sufficient legal justification for them, nor do we feel they are appropriate from a political point of view."
"Nevertheless, we must all learn some lessons from this report."
"In the first place, we should not forget that when the directive on product liability was discussed, we allowed ourselves to be swayed and agricultural products were not covered by the directive."
"We now have to admit our mistake and remedy the situation."
"Secondly, I should like to draw your attention to how the legal advisers of a number of pressure groups have recently been flooding the media with statements which might well generate confusion as regards the nature of the Community institutions and our work. It has been stated, for instance, that Parliament is not entitled to put forward certain amendments."
"It must be made very clear to the public that Parliament's power to put forward amendments is limited only by the Treaty itself. And even the Treaty is an open one, since it includes an open-ended article - Article 235 - which allows the Council to extend its powers should that prove necessary, when requested by the Commission and supported by Parliament."
"Furthermore, Community legislation - or so it has been said repeatedly of late - should be applied in parallel with national legislation."
"This is an outrageous statement, which has been denied day after day by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"As has already been established, Community legislation takes precedence."
"We also have to congratulate the President of Parliament for taking the wise decision not to declare the rapporteur's amendments inadmissible. We do not like them, and he may have had to act against the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs itself, but to do otherwise would have been an error of political and legal judgement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are totally in favour of this extension of no-fault liability as proposed by the Commission."
"But, like my fellow Liberals who have spoken previously, I cannot agree either with the tightening of liability which the rapporteur proposes and which goes too far."
"I am against shifting the burden of proof, against liability in respect of 'development risks' and against abolishing the time limit on proceedings."
"We have to remember that, unlike the USA, we in Europe have opted for wide-ranging product legislation."
"In this way, officialdom gives the consumer a kind of guarantee that products available on the market meet all the right standards and are thus safe and healthy."
"If we back the rapporteur's proposals, we shall be opting for a combination of both tough product legislation and tough rules on liability."
"In this European context, more stringent liability is not feasible for manufacturers."
"Not only would it seriously inhibit the process of innovation for businesses, it would also mean huge insurance premiums for manufacturers which would send the cost of new products rocketing."
"For the pharmaceuticals industry, for example, which is constantly looking to develop new drugs, it is just not on."
"Consequently, we shall be voting against all those amendments which seek to impose excessively stringent liability."
"Mr President, the product liability directive which was a star feature of the first phase of consumer policy was a revolutionary milestone in liability law."
"But just because it predates the Single European Act and Maastricht, that does not automatically mean it is outdated."
"Anyone suffering loss or damage as a result of a product defect has, since the directive, been entitled to compensation from the manufacturer without having to prove negligence, omission or fault on the manufacturer's part."
"Whilst no one has to be proved to be at fault, the fact of risk still remains."
"Since the directive, the risk has been borne by the manufacturer of the defective product causing the loss or damage."
"This radical change to traditional jurisprudence meant and still means that, out of concern for a degree of balance, there have to be limits on this liability: limits in time, a limited period in which proceedings may be brought, and rules to cover 'development risks'."
"There is no reason at all to change these aspects of the directive, certainly not until all parties involved have been consulted in depth."
"And this also holds good for the burden of proof."
"Not that this House ever wanted changes here."
"What we asked for, we have got."
"Our contention in the BSE Committee of Inquiry was that it was no longer socially accepted or acceptable for primary agricultural products to be excluded."
"Between 1985 and the present day, agriculture itself has radically changed and technology has made great strides in this sector."
"But between 1985 and the present day, we also had the crisis over BSE."
"That shook people's faith in food safety."
"For that reason too, broadening of the product liability directive is justified."
"It means, let us not forget it, an additional safeguard for the consumer."
"It will be an incentive for farmers to win back the consumer's trust in agriculture and farm products."
"To that extent, it is a good thing not only for Europe's consumers but also for agriculture itself."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will readily admit that I am not one of the fans of this report but, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, you are an intelligent woman!"
"I am just trying to imagine what would happen if we included game."
"Everyone knows that you can become very ill from eating certain meals."
"You can become ill from eating game."
"That sets off a train of thought: where was the pheasant bought?"
"Who shot it?"
"In what area did it live, or did it in fact fly through various different areas?"
"Or maybe it flew across border areas?"
"I live in a hunting family near the Dutch border."
"I wonder whether this pheasant might have eaten defective seeds, or perhaps even genetically modified maize?"
"In what field?"
"On which farmer's land?"
"Or perhaps the animal feed was defective?"
"I am just posing one or two questions of this kind, Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"The issue is a very serious one, but I believe we must at least try to explain the feasibility of what we are setting in motion here."
"I also have a few questions about the period for lodging claims."
"This is a very serious matter, but when you say that ten years is not enough, I as a layman simply have to ask the lawyers: will that mean in future that the person who inherits a farm will somehow or other also have to take over the product liability of the person who left it to him, such as his father, or what does it mean?"
"I just think that the Commission has presented us with a proposal which is not completely thought through and still needs a good deal more work."
"I have learned by now that we cannot restrict the Commission's right to propose, but what we can do is to call for a revised and better Commission proposal than the one we have before us here today."
"I think that when we reach that point, it is most important to us, in terms of agriculture, that we also include more of the earlier stages, the seed distributors, the genetically modified products and so forth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of agriculture, let me point out how important it is to have sensible rules for farmers on defective products."
"It is in the interest of both consumers and agriculture to require sound and high-quality products."
"As regards the farmers' liability for defective products, however, we must ensure at all costs that the producers of agricultural inputs - for example seeds, plant-protection and fertilising agents, as well as animal feed pursuant to Directive 85/374/EEC - can be held liable."
"Farmers, as the producers of primary products, must under no circumstances be held responsible for defects in inputs, since they have no influence on them."
"That is why it is most important to establish specifically that the term 'producer' means not only the manufacturer of the finished product, but also the producer of a raw material or component part of a product."
"Here it must always be remembered that seeds, including the genetic material used to produce the seed, are the raw materials of agricultural and forestry products."
"Furthermore, fertilising and plant-protection agents and animal feed used in the production of agricultural and forestry products must also count as raw materials."
"From the point of view of agriculture, these are essential conditions for liability rules which affect farmers, and they are in the interests of both farmers and consumers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights I fully endorse Mr Casini's views and would point out that this position was decided almost unanimously, regardless of group."
"Moreover, I would point out that Parliament has often and on the most diverse occasions called for better legislation and stipulated as a basic requirement that in the context of legislation we urgently need to hear the economic circles involved and then also to evaluate the impact on costs."
"It is not acceptable for Parliament simply to ignore these requirements."
"I do not want to go into the substance of Mrs RothBehrendt's amendments."
"It may well be that it is useful to change the ceilings on liability, for some areas at least."
"It may well be that it is useful to change the deadlines for lodging claims, or even to alter the burden of proof."
"I do not wish to go into any of that today; what I consider both urgent and essential is that we at least observe the requirements which we impose on the Commission, which has the right of initiative, when we put forward our own amendments."
"I think we would be disqualifying ourselves as Members if we disregarded those requirements."
"The argument that keeps being put forward, namely that the kind of rules Mrs Roth-Behrendt has in mind would offer the consumer more protection, is not good enough."
"If we want more protection for the consumer, then to be quite safe, we should immediately say that we must not eat any more meat or produce any more meat."
"But that would certainly be a disproportionate reaction."
"I think we really must argue rather more pragmatically and less emotionally here, which would serve our purpose better."
"We shall have an opportunity to discuss the matter more pragmatically when the Commission has, as announced, revised its proposal for a directive, so that all these arguments can be reviewed."
"That will be the right time to do so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not assuming that I can change people's opinions this evening."
"It would be naive of anyone to believe that they could still persuade others during this kind of debate."
"But let me address some of the objections which have been raised, starting with those of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights - sadly Mr Casini is no longer here, but Mr De Clercq and Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn are."
"I find it interesting that these objections come from a committee which is not very often faced with legislation - unlike my committee - but when it is, does exactly what you reproach me with, namely takes it further."
"Let me ask you to consider what you did with the patents directive."
"You legislated on something that was not in the Commission proposal, and I would ask you to consider what you did on designer protection, for instance, on the question of harmonising Community law on designed or protected products."
"You invented entirely new rules on compensation."
"That was not in the Commission proposal!"
"So what about the Commission's right of initiative?"
"There seems to be a slight confusion here between dreams and reality."
"You bring it up when it is politically opportune."
"I have nothing against you arguing that the content of my amendments is wrong."
"We can discuss that."
"But admissibility is not really a level at which we should be holding a discussion."
"Let me say something about their content."
"Those of you who say that I am overstepping the mark in my proposals are forgetting one thing. You cannot logically say, both here and outside in front of your voters, yes, we want to draw conclusions from the BSE crisis, and then accept some of what the Commission is doing but for the rest say: that is going too far for me!"
"Anyone who knows me is aware that the last thing I am afraid of is difficulties."
"The speaker who suggested that a moment ago should know me better."
"She knows quite well that difficulties are more likely to spur me on."
"I have no problem with being outvoted, nor has my group."
"We shall vote in favour, and then we can explain why."
"Of course I can understand why some Members have said that we are being precipitate."
"From their point of view it is of course precipitate, because if a Member State transposes legislation ten years too late, in 1998 instead of 1988, it will not necessarily want it to be amended again just a few months later."
"That is not the level at which we should be arguing either."
"I can understand you saying that we need a detailed discussion."
"We will be having it."
"We are still at first reading."
"The Commission will now have to sit down with the Council when, as I hope, Parliament has adopted some if not all of the amendments tomorrow."
"Then we will be presented with a common position, and you may be sure that the Commission will then involve all the circles concerned, industry and others, which have of course long since begun to use their influence and have also spoken with me."
"And I think it is entirely legitimate to try to achieve the widest possible agreement, but agreement for all concerned, not just for the industry but also for the consumers."
"I have not turned the burden of proof on its head."
"Anyone who says that has not understood."
"I have merely changed the burden of proof for products that no longer exist."
"A person who has suffered damage still has to prove it."
"Tomorrow we shall have a chance to show that we were serious about dealing with the BSE scandal, and tomorrow you will be able to demonstrate through your vote, in a roll-call vote, whether you were being serious or not."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive being debated today is a response to the European Parliament's recommendation following the BSE crisis."
"This called for a proposal no later than September 1997 to extend the no-fault civil liability system provided for by Directive 85/374/EEC to primary agricultural products and game."
"I emphasise the date of September 1997, which was actually set by the European Parliament to encourage us to act more swiftly."
"So the Commission considered it appropriate to put forward a proposal within the suggested deadline, and did so on 1 October 1997."
"The 1985 Directive gave consumers the right to compensation for injury resulting from a defective product without having to prove that the producer was at fault."
"By extending this right to the agricultural sector, the Commission - and this is a point I want to emphasise - has actually taken up an idea which was already present in its initial proposal from 1976."
"All the parliamentary committees which have examined the text, and in particular the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, support this principle."
"However, the committee responsible in Parliament wants the proposal approved subject to the inclusion of a number of amendments, which can be broadly divided into two groups."
"Here I want to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur, along with Mr Lehne and the other Members, for tabling compromise amendments which we have examined very carefully."
"The amendments in the first group are broadly intended to revise the basic 1985 Directive well beyond the Commission's objective, which is limited to extending the directive to primary agricultural products: these are Amendments Nos 3 to 9 and 11 to 15, on the burden of proof, risks in new developments, psychological injury, immunity, time-barring of rights, maximum liability and revision of the directive in 2000."
"The second group of amendments seek to specify certain points exclusively concerning agricultural inputs: these are Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on liability for intermediate products and means of production, and Amendment No 10 on the obligation to submit a report on the implementation of the directive in 2002."
"As regards the first group of amendments, the Commission understands the concerns which led Mrs Roth-Behrendt to propose substantial changes to the basic directive, wider than the current proposal and the European Parliament's initial recommendation."
"But the issues raised by Amendments Nos 3 to 9 and 11 to 15 call for more detailed examination than is carried out in the committee's report."
"That examination should take place in a wider context than the BSE crisis."
"The Commission takes the view that the next report on the implementation of the directive, which the Commission is to present to Parliament and the Council in 2000, may provide the best and most appropriate occasion for it."
"The report will be preceded by a Green Paper and full consultation open to all interested sectors."
"So I can confirm - for Mr Grossetête in particular - that we will issue the Green Paper before 1 January 2000."
"Two horizontal aspects - development risks unknown at the time when the product is marketed, and financial ceilings - will need to be looked at particularly carefully."
"Other points to be covered in this general examination will be statutory limitation periods, traceability, burden of proof, types of injury covered, etcetera. The socio-economic importance of the directive - several speakers made this point - means we cannot make do with hasty solutions."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can say that we fully support the aims of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 10 - the second group."
"But in our opinion these amendments are superfluous because a correct interpretation of Articles 2 and 3 of the 1985 Directive, which make all participants in the production process liable, including producers of means of production and intermediate products, and of Article 21, which requires the Commission to present a report on the implementation of the directive every five years, does, we feel, make it possible to meet the stated objectives in full."
"So the Commission cannot adopt those amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope what I have said can reassure those defending the legitimate interests of farmers by means of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 10."
"I also hope the European Parliament can support this approach when the time comes to vote tomorrow, and thus allow the Council to examine the proposal in turn, with a view to adopting a common position."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Culture 2000"
"The next item is the report (A4-0370/98) by Mrs Mouskouri, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation (Culture 2000 programme) (COM(98)0266 - C4-0335/98-98/0169(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and at the same time a responsibility for me to present the report on the Commission proposal concerning the 'Culture 2000-2004' framework programme here today."
"The beginning of that programme coincides with the beginning of the new millennium and signals a new era for the European Community and for Europe's citizens."
"Perhaps more than anyone else, the programme concerns young Europeans, those who will build our future on the basis of the diversity of European culture."
"With this new programme, culture is for the first time being dealt with as a whole within the framework of a single programme which replaces the three existing ones."
"The Commission's proposal was indeed ambitious, but it lacked transparency and detail."
"For that reason, the new programme would have been difficult to implement and would not be accessible to Europe's citizens."
"The report I am presenting to you today attempts to correct certain flaws."
"I think we all agree that culture is not something abstract, but has a specific content."
"Today indeed, more than ever, it is a many-sided industry which creates new jobs."
"Besides, the field of culture is directly related to the sectors of education and training."
"European culture with all its diversity has direct need of our support if it is to survive and develop."
"The first important change relates to the programme's title: the term 'cultural cooperation' covers neither the content, nor the structure, nor the aims of the new programme."
"We therefore propose the term 'cultural policy', thus laying the foundations for a genuine Community policy in the area of culture."
"For the structure of the programme, we propose to approach culture sector by sector, with vertical activities."
"This will make the actions more appropriate in each case, taking into account the special needs of each cultural sector, but also allowing horizontal synergies to enhance cooperation with other programmes."
"As regards the implementation of the programme, we believe that the Member States and the Commission will have to cooperate closely."
"We therefore propose an advisory committee comprising a representative from each Member State."
"Alongside it will work a subcommittee comprising experts proposed by the Member States."
"In that way, the states will become actively involved in the programme's implementation."
"Appraisal of the programme is essential to ensure transparency and projection, and we therefore propose that the Commission should periodically assess its results in collaboration with the Member States."
"I would also like to mention the development of European cultural resources."
"With those, we want on the one hand to ensure the propagation of the programme at national and regional level so that it will be accessible to local agencies as well."
"On the other hand, we want cooperation and coordination between the Commission and the Member States, as is necessary if the programme is to succeed."
"Before finishing, I should like to stress two more points."
"The first concerns cultural cooperation agreements."
"We have repeatedly asked the Commission to show us a sample of those agreements, because we still do not know what exactly they contain."
"The second point I want to mention is the budget."
"The budget proposed by the Commission is very low."
"With ECU 167 million the programme will be condemned to fail, and we therefore propose ECU 250 million, because we believe that is the absolute minimum for the realisation of so important a programme."
"Let us not forget that the new programme concerns Europe's cultural future for which we bear full responsibility on behalf of young people in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the past the European Parliament has often expressed the importance it attaches to culture and to Europe's cultural future."
"By adopting the report we are putting before you, we will be giving culture the position it deserves."
"In parallel, we will be confirming our political will to support cultural activity in the European Union and to create a single European cultural area within which the cultural individualities and values of our countries can flourish and develop."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri on all her hard work and the report she has produced."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an ambitious programme based in principle on Article 128 of the Treaty, and which I feel will develop into something much more important than it seems at present."
"For exactly that reason the presentation of this action in the form of a multiannual framework programme aims precisely to ensure cohesion and greater effectiveness, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity."
"And of course, that is not a feature of large programmes alone."
"Programmes which begin in a more modest way can also develop along those lines."
"Of course, a degree of flexibility is needed."
"It is a programme which will develop as time goes by."
"We do not know what form it will eventually take, because the actions undertaken are new and pioneering and the European Parliament has a very important role to play because many proposals will have to be monitored so that the funds allocated can be properly absorbed."
"That is precisely why the amount of funding, which in Mrs Mouskouri's proposal is increased from ECU 167 to 250 million, is - let me remind you - not a spending target and is subject to the rules of proper financial management and budgetary control."
"We also ought to remember that the general financial framework has not yet been approved."
"That sum, then, if used correctly and with the flexibility we have tried to incorporate in our proposals, can be a factor which develops the programme very substantially."
"Later on, if it turns out that more capital is required, the necessary adaptations can be made."
"Besides, according to the statement of 6 March 1995, that sum is a preferential reference for the Budget Authority in the context of the annual budget procedure."
"Consequently, the amount proposed should not create conflict between the Council and Parliament or polarisation within the Council itself."
"Let me explain that in the Committee on Budgets we did not increase the sum proposed by the Commission, but in the spirit of the statement of 6 March 1995 we proposed that it should be possible to review the sum within the annual budget procedure, up to a level of 20 %."
"If the possibility of co-finance is also taken into account, the sum becomes even bigger."
"Finally, Mr President, it must be said that this programme, which has of course taken some considerable time to be worked out by the Commission, has eventually taken shape and generated proposals, and Mrs Mouskouri's excellent report ratifies and improves them."
"But it is a very important programme, especially for Kaleidoscope and Ariane, because it ensures that the continuity of those programmes is not interrupted."
"Activities bound up with them will continue while we wait for final approval of the general financial perspectives, on the basis of which matters will develop in what I hope will be the best way."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal to establish the European Union's first framework programme for culture comes in response to wishes expressed by both the Council and the European Parliament."
"Although it respects and shares the objectives of the Commission's proposal, the Committee on Culture has nevertheless approved substantial amendments which essentially concern the structure of the programme."
"It would like it to be established, from the beginning, exactly how much importance will be given to the various cultural sectors - heritage, music, literature and so on - throughout the programme. According to the proposal put forward by the Commission, the Commission itself would establish priorities and make unilateral decisions on the relative importance of each of these sectors during the lifetime of the programme, in other words over the next five years."
"Nevertheless, we accept a number of innovations which the Commission has incorporated into its text, for instance the creation of a field for horizontal actions, integrating activities from a range of cultural sectors into a single project."
"On the other hand, we differ from the Commission in that we feel that the essential features of the current programmes must be preserved, because the results have been satisfactory, even though the expectations aroused far exceed what the budget for the programmes has allowed. In defending its proposal, however, the Commission is very critical of the results of current programmes."
"It is for this reason, therefore, that the Socialist Group joins the Committee on Culture - unanimously - in supporting the amendment aimed at setting a budget of ECU 250 million for five years, against the ECU 167 million proposed by the Commission."
"Expenditure on essential programmes in the field of Community cultural action has been curtailed in recent years, as was the case with the Raphael programme, for instance."
"The European Commission's own expectations of this programme as stated in its 1995 proposal have therefore fallen well short of being realised."
"In the financial statement for that proposal, the Commission anticipated expenditure of ECU 15 million for 1999."
"Parliament had hoped to increase it by some 40 %."
"In the event, opposition from a few Member States resulted, after conciliation, in a much reduced budget amounting to ECU 8.8 million for 1999. This was far less than the 15 million proposed by the Commission and indeed less than the expenditure on cultural heritage in the years prior to 1996, in other words when we were implementing pilot actions."
"That was in fact the very programme which the Culture Commissioner had hoped would be the flagship for the European Union's cultural action."
"Perhaps we all lacked the determination to push that proposal forward."
"We Socialists believe that the time has at last come for culture and European citizens to play a decisive role in the building of Europe."
"It is therefore very important for this programme to be supported - it is not a particularly ambitious one - and so the Socialist Group will support the amendments and Mrs Mouskouri's report as a whole. I congratulate her on her work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri for the excellent work she has done. To make this framework programme on culture for 2000-2004 effective, she has proposed a sectoral approach which takes account of the different needs of each cultural sector."
"I agree with that and I think the financing must be raised to at least ECU 250 million to make the activities possible."
"It is essential that we regard our cultural heritage as a primary resource for the European Union, which is approaching the threshold of 2000 with great challenges to face, such as enlargement, globalisation, the growth of the information society, employment and social cohesion."
"The framework programme for culture will encourage creativity, knowledge and the dissemination of the culture of the peoples of Europe, through a sectoral approach which has the flexibility to promote synergy between various sectors of the arts and new forms of expression."
"The programme aims to encourage cooperation at regional level between cultural organisations, operators and institutions in the Member States, promoting the affirmation of cultural creativity by ensuring the vitality of artistic projects, and supporting measures whose European profile will throw European culture into bold relief."
"The cultural heritage measures will certainly have the most impact - not least because of the expenditure involved - so I am a little surprised that they are placed fourth."
"In the field of cultural heritage it is right to distinguish between movable and fixed heritage."
"The latter necessarily requires more funding than the former, as shown in the budgets of the individual national ministries."
"Movable heritage involves a wide range of skills, not always specialised, for restoration activities."
"In conclusion, through cooperation between the Member States, the Culture 2000 programme must aim to encourage the conservation of movable and fixed heritage, by identifying the common European origins from which the diversity of national cultures has sprung."
"Mr President, my first task must be to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri on her excellent work - a Greek singer was surely the ideal person to carry out this work in our committee."
"' Culture 2000' represents the European Union's cultural approach for the next few years and into the 21st century."
"I completely support the idea of new guidelines for a programme which embodies cooperation between Member States in this area."
"What has the Commission proposed?"
"To gather within one programme the Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes which have allowed 1 400 cultural projects to benefit from financial support from the Union."
"Various countries of the Union, in partnership, have therefore been able, through cultural and artistic events, to develop the richness of our heritage, the diversity of our culture and the value of its complementarity."
"Unfortunately, it must be pointed out that although 1 400 projects were helped, 9 000 were proposed."
"I will leave it to you to work out the number of rejections."
"How can we improve on this when there is widespread criticism about both the distribution of resources and the problems of access for everyone?"
"The complementarity between the work proposed by the Commission and that carried out by Mrs Mouskouri, unanimously supported by the entire Committee on Culture, should give the citizens of Europe a balanced programme allowing small, medium and large projects to go ahead each at their own level, and I am very pleased about this."
"I believe that this is the best way to ensure greater participation and improved access to culture for everyone in each of the sectors concerned."
"In a Europe which seems to be increasingly controlled by bankers and stock markets, we need to recognise the true value of the benefits of cultural expression."
"Culture is a source of new jobs and I must take this opportunity to say how much I regret that the European Parliament has not had the chance to discuss the Commission's working document on 'Cultural industry and employment' which underlined the immense source of jobs to be exploited without delay."
"Specifically, the audiovisual and tourism sectors have also been identified as the most hopeful in this area."
"To conclude, I must mention the globalisation of trade and the cultural challenges linked to this, and I should therefore like to express my support for a policy which ensures respect for and the promotion of cultural diversity, both in the countries of central and eastern Europe and in the developing countries whose cultural sectors Europe, through agreements, is supporting as a full component of economic development."
"Have not those pleading the case of culture also won another victory against the OECD, which had decided to deal with investment questions without distinction between products, but was forced to give way?"
"In order not to fail in my parliamentary duty, I must point out that the resources allocated for this policy are too limited."
"I hope that the ECU 250 million voted by the Committee on Culture will be adopted by the Council of Ministers."
"The scope of this programme clearly deserves this amount."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the Commission and the DG concerned, because they took the first steps and understood the need to draw together and unify cultural measures which have hitherto been fragmented and were not guided by a common rationale and a single policy in the field of culture."
"Of course, I would like to offer particular congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Mouskouri, who has I think upgraded, improved, developed and, if you will, broadened the horizons of the Commission's proposals."
"I believe that with proper cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission, we can achieve results in the area of culture, which is unfortunately one of the European Union's major failings."
"All too often we restrict our attentions to the democratic or social deficit, but unfortunately we also face a cultural deficit because if, indeed, the construction of a united Europe with a multicultural dimension, with peoples and intellectual and artistic potentials that derive from different sources, different histories, different languages and ways of life, if the effort to build that is a historic one, it must be accompanied by a major cultural efflorescence and explosion."
"We cannot say that there is a cultural desert in Europe, but unfortunately cultural processes, particularly where young people are concerned, move along parallel lines and for that reason do not converge with the European Union."
"From that standpoint substantial initiatives are needed on the part of the European Union if we are to make contact with cultural forces which, just as much as the European Parliament's resolutions and legislation, just as much as the economic rules we establish, and in their own intangible way, will largely influence the building, character and personality of this original enterprise of global importance and historic depth which we are undertaking."
"From that perspective I agree with Mrs Mouskouri's basic observations."
"I think it is very important that the sum set aside to support this programme should be increased to ECU 250 million."
"It is also important to keep records and ensure transparency in relation to the activities that take place and of course, with my experience as a Greek MEP and with the widespread disappointment I note in many who have proposed various projects for programmes which subsequently fail because of inadequate funding, I too would like to say that it is very important to support more of these operators and, especially, to do what we can to relieve them of the burden of strict bureaucratic control by the European Union, though this does not mean that there will be a lack of transparency and financial monitoring."
"Mr President, firstly I congratulate Nana Mouskouri on a very good report."
"She has a great name in music already and she will now have a great name in cultural policy in Europe."
"As President of Friends of Music I have been very supportive and worked with Nana Mouskouri in the committee on this."
"In particular, I want to pay tribute to her for the section on music policy."
"Music is very important in the European Union."
"Some 350, 000 people are employed in the music industry and there is a turnover over ECU 15 billion per year."
"This report will help to strengthen that in terms of training, education - which is very important - and supporting musical projects on which this Parliament has taken the lead, such as the European Youth Orchestra."
"Recently I went to the European Youth Opera in Baden Baden to see that launched and it is a great success."
"For the first time we are going to fund a European jazz orchestra, the European Youth Jazz Swinging Europe which I also welcome."
"Clearly there needs to be more money as Nana Mouskouri says in her report."
"We need to fund the big projects in Europe and the small ones."
"With an expanded budget we can do that."
"We should take account of the very good advice from the European Federation for the Arts and Heritage which has just produced a conference report."
"I hope Commissioner Oreja has read that and will respond to the very good suggestions that EFAH gives us as well."
"Mr President, as a European citizen I am obviously delighted by the establishment of a new financing instrument for cultural cooperation in Europe."
"The Commission has finally realised the vital fact that Europe is more than just a vast free trade area."
"However, there is a large shadow hanging over this instrument."
"The forecast budget of ECU 167 million for five years is derisory."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur in her request for more funds - ECU 250 million - to be spent on encouraging the development of our European heritage, greater participation and improved access for citizens to cultural activities. I also agree with Mrs Mouskouri's view that culture is a way of affirming our identity to other people."
"Thanks to Mrs Mouskouri, we, the children of Athena, are no longer orphans."
"I will therefore be voting unreservedly and enthusiastically for her report."
"This vote, together with those on the creation of the euro and the enlargement of the European Union to the countries of eastern Europe, is the most important, in my opinion, since I was first elected to this Parliament."
"Mr President, like everyone else, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur for her hard work."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for making real this proposal for a single framework for culture, reflecting the political will expressed in Article 128."
"As everyone has said, it is high time for us to have a common approach and coherence and some common goals in European Union cultural policy that add value to the actions that nation states take."
"It is time we give a clear voice for our common cultural endeavour and in this sense I would wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Alavanos has said."
"We should have had a longer debate."
"One conference was not really enough."
"We could not just sweep aside Ariane, Raphael and Kaleidoscope and we had to reconcile apparently contradictory aims."
"This Parliament, on the one hand, rightly said that we need to support many small projects and operators because we see those on the ground."
"On the other hand, we must have far greater visibility and cultural policy should be visible across all Community action."
"This is very hard when only 17 % of cultural action will in any sense come from this programme."
"As we know, the big cultural money is coming particularly from the structural funds."
"So what Nana Mouskouri attempted to achieve, and why she won support in our committee, was to build on Ariane, Raphael and Kaleidoscope and the best of that, but also to reflect the views of the Commission in creating a horizontal perspective which takes into account the same proposal the Commission has made to achieve the creation of networks, inter-disciplinary projects and big symbolic projects."
"In my own constituency there is something called the Summer University of East London."
"It is one of the most magnificent cultural educational events in the whole of London but has always fallen between two stools and not managed to get funding."
"It is that kind of endeavour that should and can be supported under the kind of proposals we are putting forward."
"So we are suggesting a compromise of the best from the past but also that you must put a spotlight on European cultural action by large projects."
"I am confident we can find agreement between the institutions."
"This has to be part of the cornerstone of the People's Europe."
"That is absolutely vital and I always say that the European Union cannot live by commercialism alone."
"Mr President, a framework programme for culture is a step forward towards asserting the fact that culture should be playing the role of vehicle and lynchpin in the process of European construction."
"Europe needs to define itself through a horizontal cultural policy cutting across all policies."
"That should be its trademark for the next century."
"The Commission's Culture 2000 Programme had many positive aspects: it is a multiannual programme, integrating different sectors."
"The Mouskouri report has managed to reduce those gaps, thanks to a good deal of work and a constructive approach, which I recognise and salute. Nonetheless certain aspects that I would have liked to have seen included have been left to one side, and I would like to mention two in particular: the budget and cultural diversity."
"The European institutions' recent discovery that culture promotes social development, internal cohesion and citizenship, and makes Europe more outwardly visible, has inexplicably and ludicrously not been reflected in the budget."
"It is a mistake to think that shaving a little off the culture budget results in only slightly fewer projects."
"The question is: either we spend enough to create the critical mass for culture to bear fruit, by encouraging quality, individually or socially, or we decide to give culture peanuts."
"A European Union worthy of its own history and aware of the challenges facing it, such as enlargement and worldwide competition, must radically change the approach it has taken to grow to its present size."
"It is now and not later that the European Union must become both an economic and cultural union."
"It must assert that political will by indexing the culture budget at a realistic percentage of the Community budget as a whole."
"To begin with, at least ECU 250 million."
"That would be a signal people could understand."
"As for cultural diversity, culture cannot be dealt with like some statistic, defined once and for all."
"Culture is in perpetual motion and knows no boundaries."
"The European programme for culture, if it is to play a useful role, must be broadly based and flexible so that it can ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I should particularly like to thank Nana Mouskouri for all her hard work on this Culture 2000 report, and I support her central demand for more funding."
"If - and this appeal is addressed to the Commission - we really mean what this programme says, that culture is to be at the heart of European integration, a touchstone of Europe's values and a driving force in society, then it is really only right and proper that the funding should be increased to ECU 250 million, as our committee recommends."
"It is a disgrace that it currently only receives 0.003 % of the budget, and many people involved in cultural projects are disappointed when their applications for funding have to be rejected."
"I should particularly like to stress the commitment shown by our chairman, Peter Pex, who will be speaking shortly, by the whole of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and by the President-in-Office of the Council, Dr Peter Wittmann, who tried to convince his colleagues of the need to increase the budget at the informal Culture Ministers Council meeting in Linz."
"I only hope that the meeting of the Culture Ministers Council scheduled for 17 November will also approve the increase in funding, so that a first common position can be drawn up."
"I also support Mrs Mouskouri's proposed amendments to divide the programme into different cultural fields, as previous programmes have been, and to promote cultural networks, small and innovative projects, long-term promotional measures and the broad involvement of culturally underprivileged groups of the population."
"Mr President, if I could begin again, I would start with culture."
"This statement by the great European political figure Jean Monnet clearly illustrates the importance of culture in the European integration process."
"The European Union is not just an economic community, but a community of values incorporating a wide range of languages and cultures."
"Europe must be made into something that people can experience and understand, which is why I welcome the proposals in this excellent report for getting people involved in cultural activities."
"Due recognition is also given to the employment aspects of culture at European level."
"The requirement is that three Member States must be involved if cultural events or projects to be carried out by partnerships or networks are to receive funding."
"However, it must be ensured here that the Commission provides the necessary infrastructure so that finding partners does not become an insuperable barrier."
"Applicants would find things a good deal easier if more help was provided on the Internet or through data banks, and if there was greater transparency and more information on the programmes."
"The Commission's proposal of ECU 167 million per year will certainly not be enough to put these proposals into practice, but if we look at the amounts being spent on other programmes, the European Parliament's demands for ECU 250 million per year will probably also be too little."
"The report rightly calls for consultation with cultural operators about the implementation of the programme, and we should encourage the establishment of European cultural centres in the Member States to ensure constant contact with the various aid institutes."
"This would be another important step in the development of a comprehensive European cultural policy."
"Mr President, of course I too must compliment Mrs Mouskouri on the outcome of all her hard work and dedication to the future of cultural policy, because that is what we are talking about today."
"I congratulate the members of the Committee on Culture too for the fact that their dedication and cooperation have brought us to the point of debating this important proposal in record time."
"And lastly, I must pay tribute to Commissioner Oreja and his officials for their creative effort in preparing this proposal for a decision."
"But actually the work is only just beginning."
"What we need is good interinstitutional cooperation to implement the policy plans we shall be agreeing today."
"I have some grave misgivings about these, because in reality we have three proposals here - a Commission proposal, a Parliament proposal and this weekend I saw a Council proposal too which is markedly different from what you have heard here this evening."
"I worry too about the Council's intentions with regard to the budget."
"What are our good intentions going to come to?"
"I see cultural policy as pivotal to European policies as a whole."
"I would venture to say that, without a good cultural policy, the deepening and widening of the European Union is in jeopardy."
"So we need to work together with Europe's cultural institutions too, because they have the know-how and the vigour to implement the plans prompted by policy."
"I hope the Commissioner will reassure us presently that he will back us in impressing upon the Council shortly that we want to see a good outcome to the conciliation process, not the frustration of having to change our policy and end up choosing between half a loaf and no bread."
"I hope we can agree and get a satisfactory result, ideally before Christmas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri and the Committee on Culture on this report."
"It is a thorough and detailed study, providing clear evidence of Parliament's commitment to the cultural sector and demonstrating its determination to establish a European model of society in which culture plays the important part it should."
"In this context, it is entirely appropriate to develop a framework programme in support of this sensitive and important sector and to ensure also that our citizens become more involved in building the new Europe."
"In keeping with the letter and the spirit of Article 128 of the Treaty, the aim of the framework programme is to promote a common cultural area as a means of fostering creativity, cooperation and exchanges. It should also facilitate the preservation and dissemination of the common cultural heritage of European interest and the history of the peoples of Europe, and raise awareness of the cultures of Member States."
"The framework programme is based on a transparent global vision. Its objectives and structure are more general and, we believe, more complete than those of the first generation of cultural programmes."
"Moving on to the amendments, the Commission can accept the majority of the 31 amendments put forward by Parliament."
"It accepts Amendments Nos 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13 and 21, in the sense that they improve the text of the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission accepts the spirit of Amendments Nos 12, 23, 28, 29 and 31, and in part the spirit of Amendments Nos 10, 15 and 19."
"Finally, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 4 and 14 in part, as they are in line with the Commission's proposals."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 1, 3, and 11, the Commission cannot accept the references to cultural policy and a single market for culture in certain recitals. This is because the Treaty only provides for action to support cooperation between Member States and cultural operators and thus only allows for the creation of a common cultural area for all Europeans."
"Concerning Amendment No 8, the Commission wishes to retain the entire phrase in the recital, as it is an integral part of the text of Agenda 2000."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 4 and 14, the Commission cannot accept the reference to 'affirmation of identity vis-à-vis third parties', and prefers to retain the notion of dialogue with cultures in the outside world."
"As for Amendments Nos 17 and 20 on the implementation of the programme, it is the Commission's view that cooperation with Member States should be taken for granted, and should not appear in the heading of Article 4."
"In any case, the Commission uses its executive powers to ensure constant consultation with professionals. It does not therefore wish a specific reference to this to be included in Article 4."
"In connection with the follow-up to the programme, no requirement exists for the Economic and Social Committee to be consulted on matters of culture."
"The Commission therefore does not accept this reference, nor that concerning the follow-up to the programme, since a long, complex and costly process would result."
"The other amendments accepted or rejected in part by the Commission relate to four main issues: the types of cultural actions, the budget, comitology and measures for implementation."
"As regards the types of actions referred to in Amendments Nos 15 and 23, the spirit of which is acceptable in part, and in Amendment No 22 which is rejected, the Commission understands Parliament's desire to ensure that every cultural and artistic discipline is covered by the programme, and it agrees to the inclusion of the notions of vertical and horizontal measures in Article 2 and also, for reference, in the annex."
"However, it is the Commission's view that allocating a percentage of the financial package to each cultural sector may be detrimental to the quality of the projects seeking support. It could also mean that the organisation of the programme would be too rigid, and that in practice it would prove difficult to administer."
"Concerning the budget - Amendment No 16 - the Commission is grateful to Parliament for demonstrating once again its interest in and support for the Community's cultural action."
"It is bound to point out, however, that the proposed budget of ECU 167 million was arrived at on the basis of the budget programming authorised by our institutions and may only be revised by the two arms of the budgetary authority, Parliament and the Council."
"As regards comitology - Amendment No 18 - the Commission would like to remind the House that this issue is being dealt with in horizontal negotiation within the framework of an interinstitutional agreement."
"In addition, the Commission feels that a joint committee is the appropriate means of guaranteeing the implementation of the framework programme, and it cannot accept the inclusion of a subcommittee, since this is not in line with any of the types of committee approved by the three institutions."
"On the measures for implementation - Amendments Nos 24, 25, 26, and 27 - such measures are generally published by the Commission in the Official Journal, where information on decisions taken by our institutions is provided for the benefit of practising professionals."
"Parliament has included very specific details on implementation in its text, going so far as to fix the percentages to be allocated to each cultural area. In so doing, Parliament has introduced terms which could hamper the implementation of the programme and its efficiency."
"With regard to the reduction of the minimum contribution to specific actions from ECU 50 000 to ECU 40 000, the Commission believes that although this amendment is intended to facilitate access for relatively small cultural projects, there is a risk of encouraging more projects in this category to apply than can be provided for, given the budgetary restrictions. The dispersal of funds would therefore be replicated and not prevented as had been intended."
"In the long run, this would generate discontent rather than satisfaction amongst the cultural operators."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is the Commission's position."
"I should like to thank Parliament once again for its report. It is a thorough and detailed document, produced in record time, thus demonstrating Parliament's efficiency."
"I trust that all these contributions will enable us to consolidate a Community programme which is entirely visible to our people, to our creative spirits and to all European cultural operators."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.27 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Removing obstacles to trade"
"The next item is the report (A4-0385/98) by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation creating a mechanism whereby the Commission can intervene in order to remove certain obstacles to trade (COM(97)0619 - C4-0011/98-9348/98 - C4-0441/98-97/0330(CNS))."
"Mr President, this has been quite a controversial report from start to finish, and it is not over yet."
"Indeed, you will not find it surprising that I take the view that we should be consistent as a parliament."
"We should not be engaged in facile, political posturing but we should be involved very directly and very earnestly in trying to engineer something which benefits the citizens and the companies of the European Union in effectively building up the trade and wealth of the Union so that we can create jobs and on that basis alleviate poverty and all the other worst aspects of our society."
"I am sure Members will agree with me in this respect."
"However, I have to say that as somebody from the south-east region in the United Kingdom I have had to recognise that there are good things and bad things which come out of the EU."
"One of the worst aspects has been the effects of port blockades which cause delays."
"(Interruptions from Mr Kerr) I understand, Mr President, that Mr Kerr will have an opportunity to speak in a moment."
"In Kent, in the south-east of England, we have had to deal with some pretty severe problems."
"In particular, there were lorries parked all along the M20 which for many people in the south-east, the most populous region in the United Kingdom, is not good."
"This behaviour on the part of the EU does not lead to a sophisticated debate in terms of the EU and leaves people in the UK, as elsewhere in the EU, second-guessing what can be done to assist the process of free movement of trade."
"(Interruption from Mr Kerr: What about the workers, we say!)"
"The previous document, introduced by the Commission after the Council had asked it to intervene, introduced an specific instrument to allow the Commission to act very quickly in such occurrences."
"The single European market implies no barriers to trade and therefore the Treaty has a legal framework whereby we permit the free movement of trade."
"In practice, as I have said already, the obligation does not allow that free movement of trade."
"At worst it is ignored and at best it is conveniently forgotten."
"Whether it be British hill farmers or French lorry drivers does not matter."
"It should not happen."
"The Commission document dealt with this and attracted much attention at the time."
"Of course it did not receive popular consent and support in Parliament, primarily because it erred in two particular directions: in the area of subsidiarity where national governments would be held by their own courts to be responsible on the basis of interpreting Community law and also because of the expression of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to industrial action and strike."
"So it was rejected in the European Parliament, referred back to the Council and the Council came back with a reworked document."
"This modified text corrected both these particular problems and so we have before us in this plenary a report which Parliament, Commission and Council have jointly agreed is a progressive text."
"It is one that allows us to speed up the legislative procedure, allows companies and citizens to have their rights respected within the European Union but does not damage the social fabric on which industrial relations is based across the Community."
"These are important considerations when we come to inspect any legislation in the area and movement of trade."
"We should remember that this particular instrument comes under Article 7(a). It does not deal in any respect with the social agenda."
"What we should call for is for the social agenda to be equally respected and I call upon the Commission ..."
"(Interruption from Mr Kerr) I hope you will add on time, Mr President, for the interruptions I am getting from my colleague."
"I call in my report upon the Commission and the Council to make special provision for an equal balance to be given within the EU to ensure equal treatment for workers as well as capital."
"With regard to the amendments, these from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights which clarify the issues and to put any attempt by governments to change the situation immediately onto the Commission website rather than into the Official Journal would be of benefit."
"I note with interest that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs supports my own views about the equal treatment of capital and workers."
"However, that is best placed as a political statement rather than changing the text itself."
"This would allow us to breathe much more easily and allow this text through."
"I think this report will be seen as a quite ground-breaking."
"It will really help the companies of the European Union."
"(Interruption from Mr Kerr: What about the assembly of workers?)"
"And I believe that most of the European Union will thank us for making this sensible and progressive move forward instead of what we have had to live with over recent decades."
"Mr President, let me begin by commenting on the extraordinary qualities of the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, who has displayed common sense and legal responsibility alongside political instinct and the ability to listen throughout the lengthy parliamentary progress of this report."
"I should also like to mention Mr Wijsenbeek, whose earlier suggestions reflect a strong determination to achieve European integration and a shared concern to protect the interests of our citizens."
"The regulation we are considering should be seen in the context of the Commission's document presented in November 1997, as the speaker rightly said."
"That text raised many legal problems. For instance, it threatened to affect the balance between the institutions laid down in the Treaty."
"For this reason, Parliament welcomed the new text from the Council, submitted last July, which has led to the report now before us."
"The main difference is the elimination of the Commission's decision-making instrument, which was presenting the most difficulties."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs gave priority to considering two aspects: the proposal's legal base and its added value."
"Article 235 of the Treaty is proposed as a legal base. According to the case-law, it is applicable under the following conditions: when the aim is to fulfil one of the Community's objectives regarding the operation of the market; when the Treaty does not make specific provision for the case at issue; and when the action sought is necessary."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs queried whether the second condition pertained in this case."
"However, it eventually decided that the revised text did not involve harmonisation procedures, which are covered by Article 100a. As a result, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights agrees entirely that Article 235 provides an appropriate legal base."
"However, it is aware that integrating them successfully into the framework of primary legislation will not be without its problems. It should be remembered that, according to Article 191, it is only compulsory to publish regulations and directives of a general nature."
"Nevertheless, following the presentation of the issue by Mr Skinner, the rapporteur, I do feel that a compatible interpretation can be arrived at in the case of Amendment No 11, particularly if we bear in mind that the Treaty of Amsterdam lays great stress on transparency. Furthermore, the use of these new technologies is an excellent way of achieving transparency and of making this most important regulation known to all those affected by procedures opened under it."
"Concerning Amendment No 13, it is true that the formalities in Article 169 of the Treaty are essential, and that there is no scope for modifying them in a secondary legislation document such as this."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs decided that the form of words proposed is compatible with this requirement if it is not interpreted too strictly, whilst still naturally complying with the principles on which our Community is founded."
"The remaining amendments are aimed at broadening the scope of the regulation to include serious obstacles to freedom of movement for workers."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs shares this concern, but feels that it is not appropriate to include such measures in this mechanism for three reasons."
"Firstly, it should be remembered that this regulation was produced in response to a mandate from the Amsterdam European Council in July 1997. This mandate was restricted to the free movement of goods."
"Secondly, the particular nature of the obstacles to free movement of goods which this regulation is designed to eliminate should be borne in mind."
"They involve underhand deals, faits accomplis and physical obstacles. Obstacles to freedom of movement for workers are of a different nature."
"In terms of visual images, as the rapporteur remarked, the sight of a lorry held up on a highway is unfortunately all too common. So far as I am aware, however, the problem for workers has never been that they have been physically prevented from crossing a border or reaching their place of work, which would have been the equivalent situation."
"An attempt to provide for such disparate situations with a single legal instrument would detract from its internal coherence. It would also be to the detriment of the quality of the legislation, that is of its legal security."
"We should be doing our citizens no favours if we presented them with a hotchpotch."
"Thirdly, this is neither necessary not appropriate, because we do have another channel available, the appropriate instrument through which to deal with these concerns."
"I refer to Regulation No 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers, and Directive 68/360."
"I have before me documents COM(98)0229, (98)0230 and (98)0231 which propose the reform of the regulation and this directive, following the plan of action for the freedom of movement for workers presented by the Commission."
"That is the channel to be used, Mr President."
"That is where the amendments should be included."
"Mr President, I have just a few comments on what the previous speaker said."
"It is not enough for the Council to instruct the Commission to 'improve the free movement of goods', because we need to bear in mind the whole concept of the single market and look a little further if we want to improve that."
"This is why we must also look at the political aspects of these issues."
"But let me tell you first what I like in all of this."
"I like the fact that the free movement of goods is to be improved in principle by creating regulatory mechanisms which ban illegal action, guarantee the free movement of goods, and are currently presented in a form we can vote for."
"Before I go any further, I should like to say that I do not envy Mr Skinner this very complex task that he has taken on, but I think he has done a good job, even if we do not admittedly agree on every point."
"My basic idea is that it is important to improve the free movement of goods and to ban the protectionist measures that still exist in certain Member States, and this is why I welcome this report."
"There is one difficult area in this complex issue that needs to be looked at, and that is the fact that it is difficult to determine when action is illegal and when it is legal."
"This has led to problems, in that various countries have actually approved illegal measures, which is why we need this particular regulation now, because some countries have misunderstood the concept of the single market."
"The risk with this was that fundamental rights such as the right or freedom to strike, freedom of assembly or the right to demonstrate might also have been banned, and that is why I particularly welcome the fact that it was made clear in consultations between the Council, Parliament and the Commission that basic rights such as the right or freedom to strike should not be affected."
"This is a fundamental condition for agreeing to this regulation, and I think that with our cooperation the matter was handled successfully."
"What I do not like is the fact that we are improving only one of the four freedoms and leaving other issues aside."
"We are creating an intervention mechanism for the free movement of goods which takes effect very quickly, within five days."
"This is as it should be."
"It means that we are creating a special system of legal protection for the movement of goods."
"But when we compare the free movement of goods with the free movement of workers, we can see that there is a huge imbalance."
"There have been proceedings brought on behalf of workers in the European Union that have taken more than six years - six years for workers to win justice on a sound legal basis and with the help of the Court of Justice."
"So this five-day intervention mechanism stands in stark contrast to the unfortunate situation of workers, who should of course be able to move freely within the European Union."
"Workers face an uphill struggle to win justice for themselves."
"All of this may mean that their pensions are affected, it may mean that they have to wait years for additional pensions, and more besides. This is the point the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is making."
"We say that we should not create imbalances between the four freedoms, we should also enforce freedom of movement for workers and thus improve the entire concept of the single market."
"The whole thing would then make sense, and our proposed amendments should be seen in this light."
"This is really an appeal to the Commissioner to do more in this direction and to avoid one-sided developments designed only to help the economy."
"Mr President, I shall endeavour to follow on from what other speakers have said, because it does not make much sense to produce distinctive speeches at this time of night."
"The various speakers have stressed that this regulation has had a rough passage."
"Nevertheless, all the institutions and all the political groups agreed that something had to be done to guarantee the free movement of goods throughout the Union. There was also a consensus that the increasingly frequent acts of vandalism which were being committed in certain countries against goods originating from other Member States had to be stopped."
"The Court of Justice dealt with the issue, but an instrument to turn the freedom of movement enshrined in the Treaty into a reality was lacking."
"Although there was general agreement on the need to do something, it was difficult to establish exactly what and to specify appropriate measures."
"Some of the contentious issues have been laid before you this evening, ladies and gentlemen."
"I agree with Mr Ettl that, as a result of the discussion, the programme now before us falls short of our ambitions."
"However, I do welcome it, because despite its shortcomings it is a first step and we can build on it in the future."
"Nevertheless, I have been perturbed by some of what has been said here this evening, particularly by some remarks the last few speakers have made, and I should like to elaborate a little."
"Mr Ettl is delighted that this regulation takes account of certain fundamental rights - the right to strike and the right of association."
"Yet this should never have been in question."
"No Union measure may ever infringe those rights."
"I cannot conceive of measures which would be compatible with those rights but incompatible with the free movement of goods."
"In my view, there are no circumstances in which exercising the right to strike can involve overturning lorries from another Member State."
"The right to strike is subject to certain limitations as to its scope and effects."
"I cannot conceive either how one could ever envisage a conflict between the right of association or the right of assembly and the free movement of goods."
"In no way, surely, can exercising the right of assembly justify acts of vandalism such as overturning lorries from another Member State."
"Although I differ from Mr Ettl in this respect, I agree with him on other points. I do indeed believe that the two principles in question must be brought closer together."
"The free movement of goods has to become a reality. At the same time, provision must be made for freedom of movement for workers."
"I therefore proposed in my committee that my political group, the PPE Group, should vote in favour of the amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. However, I emphasised that in so doing, we were departing from the terms of reference of this regulation."
"The rapporteur is not present at the moment, but I have written to him to suggest a way of bringing together the issues of respect for both freedoms - freedom of movement of goods and freedom of movement for workers, whilst observing the terms of reference of the regulation. In my view, an oral amendment should be put forward, calling on the Commission to draw up a regulation securing freedom of movement for workers."
"However, if the Commissioner stated that freedom of movement for workers would be provided for in another text, we would modify the text of our amendments by the Committee on Economic Affairs, returning to the original text and referring solely to the free movement of goods. We would nevertheless be making a clear political statement of our desire to promote freedom of movement for workers."
"Mr President, a report such as this one, on the proposal for a Council Regulation creating a mechanism whereby the Commission can intervene in order to remove certain obstacles to trade, deserves another debate, not the one on the agenda at this time."
"To put it another way: this subject and this report really deserve a debate, whereas instead it seems that everything has been done to prevent one."
"Before I go on to discuss the issue in question, on which Parliament's opinion has been sought, three or four facts need to be highlighted. They are so significant that very little needs to be said about them."
"The Skinner report was approved last weekend by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"After the first stage and given the fact that the Council had reworded some of the text, the rapporteur tabled no amendments but, when it came to the vote, a number of amendments were tabled on the basis of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"The report was due to be included in the agenda of the November II or December part-sessions but seemed to have been left off both the draft and final agendas for this part-session."
"At possibly the last minute, as a result of a decision taken last night by the Conference of Presidents or a body deputising for it, the report was added to the agenda, with a deadline for tabling amendments at noon today."
"This is not a normal procedure: it suggests an urgency that nobody suspected, and it meant that we had no opportunity to raise the question of its doubtful legitimacy in terms of the Rules of Procedure, given that it was not available in certain languages and in view of the deadline set for amendments."
"We have to say that we are both surprised and alarmed at the excessive speed with which Parliament is giving its opinion on a subject such as this one."
"What it involves is an examination of the means and mechanisms for effectively guaranteeing the free circulation of goods, including the possibility of imposing sanctions on Member States, on the basis of a Commission proposal, in accordance with the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Is this an unimportant issue?"
"Of course not."
"Is this a delicate issue?"
"Of course it is, because it is a matter of compatibility between different laws and different levels of regulation, and it also deals - almost brutally I would say - with the relationship between national competences and sovereignties and the setting up of Community mechanisms and relevant regulations."
"In his explanatory statement, the rapporteur rightly tackles certain points which reveal the complexity of the intervention mechanisms to be set up."
"He rightly says that this regulation was not intended to define what civil or industrial rights or freedoms are, nor to solve the possible contradictions between different and equally legitimate rights, freedoms or interests, since those issues are the responsibility of national legal systems, if necessary in the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Therefore, the definition of obstacles to trade cannot infringe on the Member States' right and obligation not to go beyond 'necessary and proportionate measures' which do not adversely affect 'the exercise of fundamental rights'."
"Although Mr Skinner seems satisfied that the second version, in his opinion, has dispelled 'any ambiguity in this matter', he draws attention, albeit only in the explanatory statement, to the fact that industrial conflicts standing in the way of trade, the reason behind this Council and Commission initiative, do not occur at random and may be closely linked to the content or absence of other legislation on occupational issues, an equally urgent matter."
"Furthermore, the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rightly raises the problem of striking a balance between the four freedoms of movement defining the internal market, pointing out that once again emphasis has shifted to the economic sector and that the proposal for a regulation serves solely to boost the free movement of goods, thus reinforcing that trend. This is a complicated and delicate issue that is now going to be rushed through the plenary without even the minimum of required preparation."
"For our part, although we have tried to keep up with this fast pace - which is dubious not to say suspicious - we feel that this has made the debate an undesirable one; more than that, the debate is unjustified and unacceptable and we cannot therefore lend our agreement to the report put forward for our approval."
"Mr President, I think there is a fundamental problem here."
"I know Mr Skinner and Mr Ettl to be very clever and astute men, but I do not think they have thought this process through."
"The right to industrial dispute is an attempt to put such disputes on a legal footing, and it only works where there are guaranteed rights for both sides - not just individual freedoms or rights of ownership, but also rights against arbitrary lockouts and against the criminal prosecution of strikers."
"None of this has been taken into account here at all."
"Mr Skinner has very subtly drawn the teeth of the original Commission proposal, I have to admit, and Mr Ettl has added a few points which make it clear that this is the wrong direction to take, but nevertheless the original idea is still completely wide of the mark."
"A civilised European right to industrial dispute will not be achieved in this indirect manner; instead we need to sit down and talk about what the guarantees and limits of a European right to strike might be."
"This is the only way to tackle the problem, and we are therefore still not happy with the result."
"It may be that there is no alternative, but it is still the wrong approach, and Mr Skinner can do nothing to change that."
"Mr President, in our opinion it is important that the original Commission proposal giving the Member States excessive powers to intervene was not accepted."
"The Council regulation before us is a fairly acceptable compromise."
"Industrial disputes which result in the sort of obstacles we are discussing do not occur for no reason and sometimes have a good deal to do with shortcomings in the European legal system."
"As far as possible, we must leave it to the individual states to ensure the operation of the single market."
"The right to strike as such must not be jeopardised, and it is undoubtedly right that in the balance between the four freedoms, greater emphasis should be laid on economic issues."
"However, I do not think it is appropriate to mix the movement of goods with socio-political considerations, which is what some of the proposed amendments do."
"Mr President, there have been many examples of disruption of the free movement of goods in the EU in recent years, whether for reasons of industrial action, for example the French lorry drivers' blockade which caused so much damage to trans-European trade, or the more recent blockades of Welsh ports by angry farmers protesting about the ban on British beef exports due to BSE or because of falling sheep prices."
"In any event, they prevented meat trucks and other trucks from Ireland accessing routes through the UK to the continent."
"It is essential that we find a means of ensuring the reality of free movement of goods throughout the EU without prejudice to those who earn their living from inter-Community trade."
"I agree with the rapporteur that much of the problem is linked to the gap between free market conditions we now enjoy and the lack of harmonisation of rules on working conditions."
"Whatever measures we take to ensure the free movement of goods must not undermine the right to industrial action or peaceful protest by the EU workforce."
"It is, however, essential that we have a rapid system of intervention in order to reduce impediments to free movement and, wherever necessary, to provide compensation for losses for those adversely affected by such actions."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to pay tribute to Mr Skinner who is a perfect messenger of New Labour."
"I can see now why they made him number one in the south-east on the list for re-election next year."
"He defends British truck owners - some of the nastiest, most reactionary right-wing people you could meet - and attacks French lorry drivers who are fighting for fewer hours and better social conditions."
"You would have thought Labour Party members should support this."
"But of course he is a New Labour Member."
"Earlier tonight Mr John Prescott, Deputy Prime Minister, was speaking in this building to the British Labour members."
"Thirty years ago he was leading the seamen's strike."
"Under Mr Skinner's laws, Mr Prescott would be thrown in prison."
"Of course, Mr Prescott was then a member of the International Socialists."
"Today he is Deputy Prime Minister for New Labour."
"The truth is that this Council Regulation is all about keeping Mr Blair happy who went to the Amsterdam Summit and complained about the French lorry drivers."
"We in this Parliament should protect the right of workers to take action, to take solidarity action and to enjoy freedom of assembly and I would like to see a little more concern from Mr Skinner for the rights of workers and the free movement of workers, rather than the free movement of goods."
"Mr President, Mrs Palacio summed up very well in my view the legal necessity for us to accept that this instrument is to deal with the dysfunction of the market and that is what it was set out to do."
"Clearly there is no objection to that because the Treaty spelled it out."
"Mr Ettl made his view that the political balance was essential and I am pleased to agree."
"That is right and overall it should be our long-term goal."
"But I do not think this instrument is necessarily going to achieve that overnight."
"Nevertheless, politically we should make that statement."
"Mr García-Margallo y Marfil also knows that from both sides of the argument it is essential to bring those freedoms together and he, like me would join in asking for an independent instrument to do something about that sometime in the future."
"That is something which the Commission and the Council should look at."
"I have to disagree with Mr Ribeiro about the length it has taken for us to get here."
"It has been quick getting to this plenary but eight months in discussion."
"Much of the discussion took place with Mr Ribeiro there I am pleased to say."
"I am not in control of Parliament's procedures for putting this on their agenda."
"I would say to Mr Wolf that the the legal basis to guarantee strike is not subtle but very fundamental."
"This should be a freedom to which everyone in the European Union, as a citizen, trade unionist or not, should aspire to."
"I am very pleased that this is accepted for the first time in many Member States."
"I am glad Mr Wolf recognised that not too subtly but very obviously."
"The UK, for example, in this regulation now has the first mention of legally free strikes."
"I thank Mr Lukas for his comments though I do not necessarily share them all."
"Mr Gillis spoke about the French lorry blockade, UK hill farmers and the problems in Ireland."
"I agree with him an in particular his underlining of the social rights."
"But, Mr Kerr!"
"I am so sorry."
"I know he is always very good for a laugh and even at this time of the evening he is stretching our humour."
"However, I cannot agree with anything he says."
"Mr President, I want to thank Parliament sincerely for examining this proposal for a regulation with great skill and thoroughness."
"I particularly want to thank Messrs Skinner, Wijsenbeek and Ettl and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi. Like their respective committees, they have worked together with deep commitment."
"It is certainly thanks to them that we are so close to the result which I trust we will soon achieve."
"As Mr Skinner mentions in his report, the Amsterdam European Council asked the Commission to bring forward proposals designed to strengthen, in terms of speed and effectiveness, the application of the principle of free movement of goods."
"In speaking earlier to various parliamentary committees dealing with this issue, I emphasised that the important thing was to identify remedies designed to deal with restrictions on the import of goods involving the destruction and/or boycotting of the goods themselves and calling for rapid counter-measures from the Member State concerned."
"As we know, the non-fulfilment procedure set out in Article 169 is liable to be a very slow and ineffective mechanism in this kind of situation."
"The proposal for a regulation put forward by the Commission, as defined in the informal understanding reached at the Internal Market Council on 18 May 1998, provides a specific solution based on the requirement for Member States to take action to eliminate the obstacles concerned."
"It includes a special immediate alarm system and entitles the Commission to send a formal reminder to the Member States to take action."
"Some of the amendments being debated today seek to extend the scope of the regulation to obstacles to the free movement of workers, which is covered by Article 48 of the Treaty."
"That is certainly an interesting idea; and the recognition of the rights of individuals, their freedom of movement and their right to operate in the single market - I know Parliament is aware of this - is one of the Commission's major concerns."
"But at the moment the Commission has to respond rapidly to a specific mandate from the European Council which is expressly limited to the free movement of goods."
"Extending the scope of the regulation, to the free movement of workers in particular, therefore exceeds the remit from the Council."
"However, in its report on the proposal for a regulation, the Commission has not excluded the possibility of extending its scope to the other freedoms as well."
"On behalf of the Commission, I recognise that a number of Members are thinking along these lines and I do think we should consider a possible extension in the future."
"I hope it is of some comfort to those who tabled amendments to that effect that we already have certain mechanisms specifically intended to apply to obstacles to the free movement of workers - Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi in particular mentioned this - under Council Regulation No 1612/68 on the application of Article 48 of the Treaty."
"These mechanisms should be operating more effectively today as a result of the undertakings given by the Member States and the Commission in the context of the 1997 action plan for free movement of workers."
"So I think the proposal to extend the scope of the regulation to workers at this stage not only does not correspond to the wishes of the Amsterdam Council, but would duplicate remedies already provided by Regulation No 1612/68, thus adding nothing of importance."
"The Commission therefore cannot support those amendments at this stage in the evolution of Community law."
"The other amendments propose changes to the procedure provided for in Article 5 of the regulation, on the notification the Commission is empowered to send to the Member States."
"Amendment No 11 requires the Commission to publish the notification in the Official Journal in order to increase transparency and publicity about the action taken."
"Despite its aim, which I can broadly support, I do not find this amendment acceptable because it would undermine the Commission's discretion as regards infringements."
"Nor do I think that the changes it makes are essential, if I may say so."
"I would like Members to know that I will of course make use of those discretionary powers to ensure that the notification is published as often as possible."
"As regards posting the notification on the Commission's Internet website, that is an internal matter for the Commission, so frankly I think it is rather redundant and superfluous to mention it directly in a Council Regulation."
"On Amendment No 13, I want to make it clear that, even though it pursues the laudable aim of speeding up the procedure for dealing with internal market infringements under the scope of the regulation, it is not possible to accept the amendment because it threatens to introduce confusion between instruments based on two different legal bases."
"This is a regulation based on Article 235, and as such it cannot interfere with the scope of Article 169 and the freedom of action that article confers on the Commission."
"I entirely understand the reasoning behind the amendment, and I want you to know I shall be suggesting that the Commission should systematically send the Member State concerned a letter of notice under the terms of Article 169, in addition to the notification provided for in the proposal for a regulation we are now considering."
"That will mean an immediate start to the infringement procedure period under Article 169, so that the case can be brought to court expeditiously where necessary."
"Amendment No 14, on the other hand, clarifies the wording of Article 5(6) and appears well-founded."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the Commission considers that the compromise proposal, which found a unanimous consensus in the Internal Market Council of 18 May 1998, will be capable of adding the value the European Council asked for."
"I need not repeat my strong conviction that the progress made so far, thanks to the political will of the Council and Parliament, needs to take concrete form as soon as possible through the adoption of the proposal for a regulation."
"I trust that will happen and I am strongly committed to this issue politically, because this is one of the most crucial functions of the single market, though not of course the only one."
"Mr President, I notice that the Commissioner did not talk about Amendments Nos 15 and 16, the splendid amendments submitted on behalf of the Green Group in my name, calling for freedom of assembly."
"Is this a concern that the Commission does not share any more or is it, like Mr Skinner, more interested in the freedom of goods than the freedom of people?"
"- Mr President, the rights Mr Kerr refers to are of the greatest importance."
"It is, however, our view that the whole of the proposed regulation as well as its specific language do not make it necessary to add the specifications proposed in the amendments you mentioned."
"Mr President, the Commissioner referred to Regulation No 1612/68 but failed to mention that Parliament is considering the proposal to amend this regulation - document COM(98)229 - and the proposal for a directive to which I referred - document COM(98)230."
"I agree entirely with what the Commissioner said."
"The appropriate instrument already exists for dealing with amendments concerning freedom of movement for workers, an issue which is of such concern to us all."
"There is therefore no need to ask the Commission to create a new instrument or launch a new initiative."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"SMEs and craft sector"
"The next item is the report (A4-0359/98) by Mrs Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the coordination of activities to assist small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the craft sector (1997) (COM(97)0610 - C4-0019/98)."
"Mr President, it was disappointing to find that Mrs Thyssen's report did not really take up the important proposals from Members responsible for drafting opinions, like myself."
"The report seems timid and is limited to an overview of small and medium-sized companies without putting forward proposals which would introduce a breath of fresh air."
"With globalisation the role of SMEs has increasingly taken on international proportions and significance."
"It is now widely recognised that SMEs constitute the key sector for economic growth and the consequent creation of jobs."
"Furthermore, the present VAT system places an excessive burden on businesses and discourages cross-border trade."
"On reducing the indirect labour costs arising from national law, the Commission has pointed out that SMEs are hit hardest by relatively high tax burdens and contributions."
"The need to lighten the fiscal load on labour is now clearly recognised by all the main political players."
"There are three ways of improving the competitiveness of the industrial fabric of SMEs throughout Europe: reducing tax burdens that penalise employment, simplifying red tape for SMEs, and opportunities for experimental reductions in VAT."
"SMEs are increasingly entering the global market by belonging to networks of companies for the purchase and exchange of production factors."
"Cooperation between companies creates wealth and sources of innovation and new jobs, making it an instrument in the development of endogenous local potential."
"Finally, an optimal partnership is needed between European institutions, Member States, regional and local authorities, professional organisations and the SMEs themselves."
"That can help reduce administrative segmentation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report clearly describes the aims which a sensible SME policy must pursue in the new millennium."
"The SME dimension must become a much more definite aspect of Community policy than hitherto."
"There are still many areas at both national and EU levels where obstacles have yet to be removed and life needs to be made easier for small businesses."
"I am therefore also grateful for the detailed report by the BEST task force, which has made a considerable contribution towards creating a better European entrepreneurial environment."
"I also support the idea of obtaining appropriate information on small and medium-sized firms and making it available at all political levels."
"We are quite happy with the data provided by the European statistical system both on small and medium-sized firms and on the Observatory, but we should not forget that the provision of data creates problems for many businesses."
"The administrative burden, particularly for firms with few employees, must not be allowed to grow any heavier, and from now on we must try to ensure that statistical reporting requirements are efficiently deregulated."
"The second approach recommended in the report is also a step in the right direction."
"Small and medium-sized firms must be more involved in the Community programmes, and I would mention here the third multiannual programme, which will next year be open to some of the applicant countries."
"Another important and influential decision is to be taken next week, when the Conciliation Committee meets on Tuesday to discuss the fifth framework programme of research."
"I feel sure that everything will be done to ensure that this programme goes ahead next year, because it is of such particular relevance to small and medium-sized firms which Parliament has proposed should be given special assistance."
"Mr President, I sense a certain amount of scepticism from our rapporteur about the usefulness of this repetitive and routine exercise which the Commission's biannual report on the coordination of activities in favour of SMEs and the craft sector has become."
"We all know, however, what an essential role SMEs play in terms of innovation, job creation and regional development, particularly in rural areas."
"In France, for example, 37 % of employees work in enterprises with less than 20 workers, and two-thirds in enterprises with less than 100 workers."
"The craft sector represents 13 % of the working population and employment is increasingly shifting towards the SMEs."
"Why then does our rapporteur stress that 'there is no point in constantly reiterating the same views and drawing up unreadable reports and resolutions'?"
"This is because, in this area of national competence, there are serious doubts about the usefulness of the role played by the Commission in terms of coordination and structural aid."
"On this last point, the Commission states that large amounts of public money are available to SMEs, particularly in the context of regional funds and certain Community initiative programmes."
"But to what extent are these funds used?"
"How are they used and by whom?"
"Is this aid really useful and effective?"
"Would other systems not be more economical and better suited to the real needs of enterprises?"
"We have no answers to any of these basic questions and no assessment of these issues."
"Such uncertainty and absence of monitoring are totally unacceptable."
"It is not satisfactory, as the rapporteur stresses, that the Commission is content to assert, 'often on the basis of purely theoretical data, that SMEs are receiving the necessary attention'."
"These are just cliches, and we are not likely to be reassured by the remarks of the Court of Auditors, which tell us that the occasional data provided by the Commission are not reliable and that large enterprises have captured aid intended for SMEs."
"We are therefore in a real mess and we must ask ourselves about the relevance of such Community aid schemes."
"It is curious that the Commission does not question the proliferation of regulations which it is itself responsible for imposing on SMEs, nor the need to provide better protection for SMEs against unfair competition, counterfeiting, moonlighting, social and environmental dumping and the risks of relocation."
"Mr President, the basic message in this report is entirely welcome."
"The Structural Funds are now going to have to focus on SMEs much more in future."
"However, I would point out that both the Commission's coordination report and the present report clearly show once again just how far the obsession with subsidies dominates our economic thinking."
"It is now high time that the emphasis was shifted onto entrepreneurial independence, and we MEPs could play a highly constructive role here."
"For example, we should keep mentioning the EEIG, the European Economic Interest Grouping, in our talks with SMEs."
"This extremely useful opportunity for entirely unbureaucratic and flexible cross-border cooperation has not yet been exploited as it should be."
"Yet the form of cooperation involved not only brings business advantages, but is also very much in keeping with the spirit of the single market."
"In conclusion, I agree with the rapporteur's request to the Austrian Presidency to organise a seminar for the social partners and SMEs on improving social dialogue in Europe."
"Mr President, I see that my honourable friend Professor Secchi is not here."
"Would you be good enough to allow me 30 seconds of his time so that I can just address a few words to the draftsmen?"
"Mr President, for the benefit of the draftsmen of opinions on my report, I should mention the fair comment by Mr Cellai that there is little trace in my report of the specific proposals contained in the opinions."
"That is indeed the case, but I would ask them not to see that as a lack of respect for the work done in the other committees."
"We shall certainly be taking due account of it in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs when we debate policy on SMEs."
"But the difficulty we had was as follows."
"We are limited in the space we can give to an opinion."
"We realised that we just could not write meaningfully and formulate meaningful, detailed proposals about every last aspect of policy on SMEs."
"We explicitly put that fact to our colleagues and decided in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we would confine ourselves to the methodology of the Commission's policy on SMEs and not comment on every last detail of the policy itself."
"That is why you find so little trace of your opinions, but you can take it from me and my fellow members of the committee that they are much appreciated!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.15 p.m.)"
"Education programmes"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0373/98 by Mrs Waddington, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision establishing the second phase of the Community vocational training action programme 'Leonardo da Vinci' (COM(98)0330 - C4-0522/98-98/0196(SYN)); -A4-0371/98 by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing the second phase of the Community action programme in the field of education 'Socrates' (COM(98)0329 - C4-0510/98-98/0195(COD)); -A4-0389/98 by Mr De Coene, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing the Community action programme for youth (COM(98)0331 - C4-0511/98-98/0197(COD))."
"Mr President, the proposals for a new Leonardo programme give us the opportunity to recognise the growing importance of vocational training to individuals, enterprises and the economy and to think creatively about how the European Union can add value to Member States' own systems, encourage innovation and transnationality."
"The Commission's proposals to simplify the aims and measures of the new programme are to be welcomed, as is their willingness to cooperate with Parliament and its committees in agreeing to introduce further improvements."
"I want briefly to outline the main areas of concern to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which are contained in our amendments."
"Firstly, we have proposed that the Leonardo programme should influence national vocational training programmes by supporting innovation, lifelong learning, employability and accessibility."
"The lessons learned from Leonardo II can be mainstreamed through the other EU programmes, in particular the European Social Fund, but this will need a level of synergy, integration and coordination not achieved in the current programme."
"Secondly, we have emphasized the need to combat discrimination and remove the barriers to participation."
"For example, the upper age limit for involvement in the transnational mobility projects has been removed and the special needs of people with disabilities have been recognised."
"In view of the importance of vocational training, not only to Member States and the social partners, but also to civil society, we have called for a greater involvement of consultation with NGOs."
"Innovation is a key element."
"The unique feature of Leonardo is its ability to test new transnational approaches in vocational training."
"Evaluating and disseminating Community innovation rather than simply funding exchanges is the central objective of the programme."
"That is why we have proposed that a higher percentage of the budget should be spent on innovation projects."
"To encourage innovation, transparency and more effective management of the programme, we have proposed only two clearly defined selection procedures, centralised and de-centralised."
"I understand that the Commission and the Council are still discussing these management issues but I would like them to recognise the important role the Commission must play in ensuring innovation, transnationality, quality, efficiency and simplicity in the selection of the projects and in the management of the programme."
"We believe this can be achieved without excessive bureaucracy."
"We have also stressed the importance of evaluation in the new Leonardo programme."
"Evaluation should be a requirement for every proposal built in at the outset and used as a tool to influence and improve vocational training systems and approaches."
"While the current programme has been popular, there have been criticisms of the content, procedures and management which need further investigation."
"I have written to President Santer on this matter and I hope that the lessons have been learned."
"I have listened to and valued the views of a range of organisations, including the social partners, in drawing up the proposals for Parliament."
"Our joint proposals presented here today for improvements to the new Leonardo programme provide a new opportunity to realise the potential of a European vocational training programme which, along with the new Socrates and Youth for Europe programme, make a major contribution to a Europe of lifelong learning."
"Essentially, Leonardo can influence the systems of provision in Member States, encourage transnationality and innovation, enable mobility and is a programme which gives us a lot of confidence in the future."
"We know that vocational training will continue to be a key element in economic development in Europe."
"This programme must be valued and seen as a laboratory for innovation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that the Commissioner is not here, but Commissioners always seem to be late these days."
"Perhaps she has been held up in traffic, or at least I hope that is the reason."
"Ah, excellent, there she is now."
"I should like to begin by quoting something that Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of Europe, said: we are not linking countries, we are uniting people."
"This objective must be the guiding principle behind the policies of the European Union and, especially, of the European Parliament."
"Our hopes mainly focus on the young generation, because they are the ones who will shape the future of our countries, and we therefore need to ensure that young people will, as we hope, really connect with the European integration process."
"If we can establish close-knit ties between young people in Europe, such as through education networks, we will create a Europe that will be stronger, more united and greater than we could ever imagine."
"This idea was one of the main reasons why a European education policy has now become one of the European Union's central tasks, and it is also why we need a comprehensive concept to promote the European dimension in education."
"I would add that it is not our intention to change or harmonise the education policies of the individual Member States, but we would like to be able to do what the individual countries cannot do as well as we can at European level."
"All we want to do is to increase the European added value here."
"We should remember that education and training are also the keys to Europe's competitiveness, which is why the specific objectives of our education policy are to improve the quality of education and to prepare young people for occupational and social integration."
"This will allow young people not only to play a part in society, but also to assume a position as an economic player."
"The new Socrates programme and the other programmes we are discussing here are being expanded to become a genuine European citizens' programme that will link up with other vocational training, research and youth programmes to become much more efficient."
"To date, some 110 000 young people, 500 000 students and 60 000 teachers have taken part in exchange schemes under the Socrates programme, 30 000 language teachers have attended further training courses, and 1 500 universities and 10 000 schools have taken part, not to mention all those who took part in the lifelong learning schemes."
"In future the programme will be more decentralised and the application and selection procedures will be simplified."
"The programme is aimed at around 300 million people between school age and retirement age or, to put it rather crudely, from the cradle to the grave."
"This is why we need to take a great deal of care with this programme, and it is also why, although the Commission proposal is an extremely good one - and I would like to underline this point - we have made some changes that we, as representatives of the people, are offered every day at home."
"Some of the changes we have made are substantial, some are merely points of detail."
"One very substantial change is that we have condensed the Commission's proposed eight actions into six."
"Our aim here, if I might just explain why we did this, was to highlight the importance of the five main actions."
"Let me run through them for you."
"The first, I am pleased to say, is Comenius, which covers school education, school partnerships and staff working in schools."
"The second is Erasmus, which covers higher education, cooperation between European universities and student and teacher mobility."
"The third is Grundtvig, which covers other educational pathways, adult education and new educational approaches."
"The fourth is Lingua, covering the teaching and learning of languages."
"The fifth is what I prefer to call Minerva rather than the Commission's idea of Atlas, because I think that multimedia, which is what this action is all about, requires great wisdom, so I prefer to have Minerva as its patron saint."
"The sixth action covers horizontal measures."
"We have placed great emphasis on improving young people's language skills, and we want them to learn two foreign languages in future, one the language of a neighbouring country so that they can gain a much better experience of the single market around them, and the second another communication language."
"In the Comenius action I have changed the Commission's proposal, which it has accepted."
"I do not think that schools wishing to take part should have to submit a plan."
"Commissioner, I do not like plans."
"Plans are just a paper exercise, and that is not what this is all about."
"I would point out that I still support the idea that teachers wishing to take part should be able to submit individual applications."
"Remember, the school system is different from the university system."
"I also welcome the fact that pupil exchanges are to be possible in future."
"We have added something to the section on Erasmus which aims to limit the little funding available to those who really need it, if this is possible under the various national aid guidelines."
"We have made further efforts to promote the ECTS system here and have asked the universities to look at it."
"I should just like to add a few words on the subject of finance."
"This is the most important element, and I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for supporting us again."
"ECU 1.4 billion is too little."
"It is too much for the programme to fail, but too little to keep it alive."
"We have called for ECU 2 billion over five years, for 15 Member States and 13 other associated countries that are also involved."
"All we can say is that this is the only thing we can really do to help people to become good European citizens."
"The many information campaigns are all well and good, but they are just ad hoc measures."
"These education programmes make young Europeans into people who think and feel intensely European, so please help us to convince the Council to give us ECU 2 billion over five years."
"Thank you, Mrs Pack."
"The final part of your speech provided the basis for the debate which will take place in the conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just before the summer recess, Commissioner, you presented your Youth 2000-2004 programme."
"We are glad to now have a comprehensive programme in which measures which target the same group are brought together."
"This makes for greater coherence between the various measures, avoids a fragmentation of resources which are, after all, thin on the ground, and enables us to conduct a clearer policy."
"We are keen to support you in that policy, as you can see today just a few months after you first presented your document."
"As rapporteur, I have been concerned from the start to address the following points."
"Firstly, that this programme should reach as many young people as possible and above all those young people who have the greatest need for this kind of programme."
"Secondly, the programme should have a political dimension built into it."
"This programme must involve young people too in building the European Union by strengthening their notion of European citizenship."
"Your proposal, Commissioner, puts the main emphasis on young people's employability."
"But the European Parliament wishes to broaden that objective and so make the programme more balanced."
"I will just go through the amendments to your programmes which have in the meantime been submitted by the European Parliament's Committee on Youth."
"First and foremost an increase in the budget."
"You propose ECU 600 million and we are asking for 800 million, because the amount has to show that Europe really is committed to investing in its younger generations and, moreover, we need that much in order to achieve the programme's ambitious objectives."
"Increasing the budget is one thing, but no less important to us is a redistribution of the funds."
"Because in your proposal, and do not take this the wrong way, Commissioner, the European Voluntary Service is strikingly predominant."
"If we look at the figures, we see that two thirds of the monies under the whole programme are going directly or indirectly into the European Voluntary Service."
"We are not for or against the European Voluntary Service, that is not the issue, but we can see that other programmes such as exchange projects or initiatives in favour of young people may be squeezed as a result."
"That is why we wish to strike a balance, without creating any kind of panic, because the European Voluntary Service will always receive more money than the sums requested for it on Parliament's behalf in the past by Mrs Fontaine, who was rapporteur at the time."
"We have a number of arguments in favour of that balance."
"In your proposal, and we understand that, the references are almost exclusively to preparation for the world of work, entering the employment process, and social and vocational integration."
"Sadly, concepts such as European citizenship for young people, living together and inter-cultural learning have been pushed into the background."
"Naturally we are convinced of the special importance of work to young people, but this target group is equally alert to things like the environment, law and order and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, European and international cooperation, and the position, rights and obligations of young people in society."
"We also believe that this programme must provide an answer to phenomena such as individualism, nationalism, uncertainty, and lack of faith in others and in the future."
"Consequently we think the pillar of youth exchanges must be strengthened, especially since if we increase and redistribute the funds available, we can hopefully involve some one and a half million young people in the various measures and actions."
"We have one or two more points to make."
"We believe - and we looked at the experiment you tried with the CFO - that voluntary service must not replace paid jobs, and that beneficiary organisations must respect the European Union's rules in every particular."
"Fourthly, we think that the money must go primarily to those who need it most, and in our evaluation work we have found, from talking to young people and agencies on the spot, that it is those who know the situation best who are often best able to benefit from the funds available."
"So we want to change things here, precisely for the benefit of those young people who invariably miss out."
"Lastly, we want more openness in evaluating projects, better publicity for programmes and a measure of flexibility in setting the age limits."
"Parliament's Committee on Youth was keen above all to listen to young people themselves and to the organisations which oversee the implementation of the programmes."
"We were in touch with some 5 000 young people, and out of those contacts we distilled a report which had a multiple objective."
"One, to invest more money to enable more young people to be reached."
"Two, to achieve a balance between the various actions, stricter guidelines and better scrutiny to ensure that funds were being properly spent."
"Three, to make access to and implementation of the programme more democratic and, lastly, to give young people better hopes for the future and at the same time to ensure more of a future for the project of building Europe by increasing the number of young people involved."
"Mr President, with the three proposals we are debating today, just as with the 'Culture 2000' programme we looked at yesterday, the Commission is inaugurating a new overall approach in its efforts to put into practice the strategic guidelines embodied in Agenda 2000 and in its statement of November 1997 on the Europe of Knowledge."
"A common characteristic of all three proposals is that by improving knowledge and education, both general and professional, they all aim indirectly and directly, or their result could be, to improve employment and reduce unemployment in the medium and long term."
"So it is very important that these programmes should be coherent, in other words be mutually compatible and show synergy with other Community programmes, which would make all of them more effective. This not only provides good reason to extend programmes which have already proved their value, but also justifies the new framework into which they are being brought."
"It is not, therefore, just a quantitative increase which is involved, but also an important qualitative improvement."
"We took that into account in the Committee on Budgets when considering how to deal with them from the financial standpoint."
"These programmes are not isolated activities, and the two proposals we are debating aim to establish genuine Community policies in the areas of education and youth, as required by Articles 126 and 127 of the Treaty."
"The sectors in question are ones for which the Member States are mainly responsible, and I will come back to this later, Mr President."
"However, bearing in mind the principle of subsidiarity, the Community is there to supplement activities by the Member States, confer upon them a new European dimension, coordinate the respective activities at a multinational level, and promote cooperation between Member States and with third countries and international bodies."
"In other words, it is there to do what the Member States could not do for themselves, or even if they did, then without the same efficiency and overall added value at Community level."
"Now, purely from the financial standpoint, we must not forget that the level of funding required and the new financial framework have not yet been decided, but are still under discussion."
"I therefore think - and this is the opinion of the Committee on Budgets - that an increase from ECU 1 400 to 2 000 million at this time may be excessive."
"I know that this is not a particularly popular idea with the relevant committees, but there is always the second part of Amendment No 17 which provides for the possibility of annual adaptation by up to 20 %."
"This creates the scope for much more funding to go to programmes which prove successful."
"In any case, may I remind you of what I said yesterday about the 'Culture 2000' programme, with reference to the indicative nature of the sums involved when these are recorded in legislative acts, and about the role of the annual budget procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are two things we must remember."
"The first is that once sums have been recorded, it is a major responsibility for Parliament and for the Commission too of course, to ensure that the programmes covered by those sums are implemented."
"In other words, to ensure that there will be no surpluses that create problems of a financial nature in subsequent financial years."
"The second thing we must remember is that framework programmes often come under the responsibility of Parliament and test its ability to be a full member of the two arms of the Budget Authority in dealing with the budget of the European Union every year."
"So when we set up major framework programmes without having the possibility of adapting them according to results, we are to a certain extent creating problems regarding Parliament's rights in financial and budgetary matters."
"Let the relevant committees bear those two points in mind, and take on board the proposal we are making."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal for the second phase of the Socrates programme connects with the broader situation."
"In addition to the Socrates programme, it covers the Leonardo da Vinci programme for vocational training and the new Community action for youth programme, which is to be formed by combining the Youth for Europe programme with European voluntary service activities."
"Altogether ECU 3 billion has been allocated to finance these three programmes over the period 2000-2004."
"Together with one other programme, the Culture 2000 programme, they represent a substantial confirmation of the EU cultural dimension."
"Because there are still many different programmes, and because they have been implemented fairly randomly, the Committee on Budgets thought it was important to boost their synergy value."
"This idea was brought up during discussions on next year's budget."
"Likewise, the committee considered it important to promote job creation through these programmes and also in cooperation with the research and new technology programmes."
"The report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media also discusses these ideas."
"The Socrates programme is the largest of the culture programmes."
"The Commission proposed ECU 1 400 million in funding for the next five year period."
"The Committee on Budgets considered this figure to be acceptable as an initial guide, but wished to establish some leeway and therefore tabled Amendment No 1, which proposes a 20 % margin to allow for deviation from the sum allocated, should any new objectives or permanent factors that are clearly and precisely justifiable present themselves."
"The Committee on Budgets believes that administration costs, general aid and technical support must be kept separate from normal operational expenses and should be approved separately by the budgetary authority."
"They represent a large item of expenditure, approximately ECU 85 million, which eats into the normal resources considerably."
"In addition to the changes mentioned, the Committee on Budgets examined certain other details which are described in its opinion."
"The Socrates programme is one of the most successful EU programmes."
"For that reason, the Committee on Budgets continues to give this Commission proposal its strong support, just as we did before."
"Mr President, I am speaking as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and on the basis of the dual-approach procedure, the Hughes procedure, which we too applied in committee particularly in relation to the Youth for Europe programme."
"First of all, I too would like to say that we think these three programmes, the Youth programme, the Leonardo programme and the Socrates programme, really form a single entity, a general framework to which the European Commission, with its specific proposal, is adding flesh and bones."
"We think this framework is exceptionally important, particularly the Youth programme."
"Furthermore, and with particular reference to Youth, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stresses the importance of promoting active and responsible citizenship in the European context, by advocating fundamental values such as solidarity and the encouragement of participation."
"Beyond that, the acquisition of general skills and qualifications is particularly important since it is both directly and indirectly related to employment."
"On this point let me just say that, by definition, activities related to young people and their employment involve mainly voluntary provision at local level, usually with citizens' associations and non-profit-making groups, in other words in some way related to third-system employment, a subject to which, as we know, the European Parliament attaches particular importance."
"Moreover, we believe that the programme must focus on encouraging young people from deprived environments to become active, precisely to enable those groups to express themselves."
"In that spirit, then, we have tabled a whole series of amendments - about 20 in all - aiming to emphasise those points."
"Here, I must thank the Committee on Youth's rapporteur, Mr De Coene, who accepted most of the amendments so that what is being put to the vote today is in some way a common approach."
"Mr President, we have three reports aimed at achieving one objective: a citizens' Europe."
"The commitment given in the Treaty of Amsterdam for a policy of lifelong knowledge and learning shares the same objective."
"The Commission deserves congratulations when a Community action achieves its objectives."
"I sincerely believe that the three programmes - Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth for Europe - have been a success, and we must congratulate all those who, at one stage or another, have been involved in their implementation."
"The Commission plans joint actions for the three programmes with the aim of rationalising them and making them more efficient, at a time when the distinction between initial and continuing training is becoming blurred, just as it is between formal and informal training."
"And I fully support this plan for joint action; I believe that it represents a positive and innovative move."
"Unfortunately, this is not the only thing these programmes have in common."
"Indeed, they all share an element of poverty, despite the funding recently obtained for Socrates, and as we are continuing to extend their scope, it is resources that are most lacking."
"However, the UPE Group will support the content of these three reports, and I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the quality of the work carried out and their willingness to listen to all the points of view."
"So what is the second generation of these programmes going to involve?"
"As far as Socrates is concerned, it involves strengthening the European dimension of education at all levels, promoting cooperation in the field of education, removing obstacles to such cooperation and fostering innovation in this area."
"This programme is now well-known to everyone, and in spite of the many difficulties and obstacles relating to mobility, there are still just as many applicants who hope to benefit from the programme."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture on the Leonardo da Vinci programme, I would like to look at it in more depth."
"Leonardo da Vinci is aimed at improving and strengthening the social and occupational integration of young people through access to continuing training throughout their lives."
"I would like to highlight three fundamental points."
"The first involves recognising the benefits of mobility and the will to develop virtual mobility to supplement it."
"I support this, as I believe that new communication technologies should get rid of the problems relating to distance; however, I would emphasise here the importance of the irreplaceable element of face-to-face meetings."
"In particular, new technologies must bring rural areas closer to urban areas, and those in the north closer to those in the south. This is the main benefit of the programmes: being able to integrate the new technologies and knowing how to use them, without forgetting the importance of face-to-face exchanges."
"The second point relates to the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of work-linked training opportunities and vocational training, and their involvement in social dialogue and partnership, which is still not sufficient."
"We must review this situation with a political will for genuine dialogue."
"The third point relates to the need to promote the programme among people of all ages, since the objective of lifelong training cannot mean that these programmes are restricted to young people alone."
"Finally, and this will lead me on to the Youth for Europe and Voluntary Service programme, I have to point out that we must very quickly ensure that recognition is given for the knowledge which the various participants in these programmes have acquired through informal education."
"In conclusion, I would like to look at the framework programme for youth, and at its assets and weaknesses."
"The Youth for Europe programme encourages the promotion of informal education experiences for young people by facilitating mobility within the Union and to third countries."
"It also encourages young people to show initiative. Among its assets is the fact that the success of the European Voluntary Service experiment guarantees the success of the programme; its objectives are praiseworthy and have indeed been praised, but it receives much more money than the other actions within the Youth programme."
"Its weaknesses are naturally of a financial nature."
"This action is an opportunity for young people to show initiative and commitment, and it will allow them to take hold of Europe in both hands and to become true European citizens, responsible for their own future and involved in the creation of their own jobs. In this respect, I have to say that I deeply regret the fact that this action is neglected financially, given the enormous challenge it represents."
"I have, in fact, made two proposals concerning this report. We need to rebalance the budget for these actions and we should create a structure designed to collect information and documentation on young people as well as specific publications and studies both from Member States and Community institutions, or from young people's organisations themselves, which would allow us to develop the programmes for the benefit of young people."
"This structure could be complemented by an Internet site that would be run by the Commission and that would promote interactive communication among young people in a wide range of areas, but that would not necessarily form part of the integrated Community policies."
"We must give Europe to the young people and they must take it in their grasp."
"That is the work before us, and the structure could be called 'Europe 15-25'."
"I was held up by the traffic a little this morning, Mr President, but doubtless other honourable Members had the same problem."
"Thank you for your patience."
"On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I can say that this second generation of programmes, and particularly Socrates, represents quite a large step forward in terms of cohesiveness and management."
"We note, however, that there is no strategically new concept."
"But I think that if we look at the impact which this kind of programme has on jobs, we have to acknowledge that programmes like this are extremely important, since one of the things they do is encourage the mobility of labour within Europe."
"After all, the process begins when you are young: if you are accustomed to studying in another country, you are more likely to be willing to work in another country."
"Excellent projects are often developed under these programmes to promote that kind of thing."
"There are one or two points where I would have wished things to be different."
"Separate agreements are to be concluded for Malta and Turkey."
"The Commission has still not produced any proposals for these, nor for the separate agreement guaranteeing access for those countries."
"At the very time when we want to give an extra chance to democracy in countries such as these, and I have Turkey in mind, we ought to be putting these proposals forward."
"We have already been waiting for them for a year now, if not three or four years."
"As regards the information society, I would also recommend that we think about cooperation with countries like Japan and the USA."
"It is most important that young people should have the chance of international exchanges under these programmes too."
"This is touched on in the proposals but not yet addressed in any depth."
"I would urge the Commissioner to give some further attention to that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission as a whole for proposing the much-needed extension of the Socrates programme."
"I support the aims that have been mentioned of ensuring the concentration and continuity of aid and accessibility, although I would have liked to see more effective concentration in practice on areas where Europe can genuinely add value."
"A fundamental point, however, is that although Socrates and the other youth programmes have now become an essential part of Europe's education policy, they have also become an easy excuse for Member States to avoid doing more themselves to europeanise their schools, universities and educational establishments."
"It would therefore be extremely welcome if Parliament and the Council could agree on a much bigger financial package for the programme."
"The ECU 2 billion called for by the committee is the absolute minimum as far as my group is concerned."
"The Commission's proposal for ECU 1.4 billion spread over five years is not really an increase if you take account of the latest situation as regards expenditure, the extra spending on adult education that is now included, and the additional burden created by opening up the programme to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Nor is it enough if we want to correct the social imbalance in the programmes, as we Social Democrats do."
"The shortage of funding for Socrates and the other youth programmes stands in stark contrast to all the fine words spoken about the need for more contact between young people in Europe and the creation of a genuine European education area."
"It is simply not on, as we keep complaining, that EU youth exchange schemes should be given less money per year than is paid in agricultural aid for growing peas, field beans and sweet fodder lupins."
"People also forget that, in addition to promoting integration, Socrates also does a great deal to promote employment."
"All young people should be given the opportunity during their education to experience other countries and to improve their knowledge of foreign languages."
"This is all about equality of opportunity."
"Instead of the 2 % of students currently taking part in Erasmus, we feel the figure should be nearer 10 %."
"And the same should apply to young people in vocational training, less than 1 % of whom currently take part in EU exchange schemes."
"From the outset, therefore, my group has called for more funding for the programme, because the individual grants are far too small."
"The average paid under Erasmus, for example, is only ECU 70, which is certainly no incentive for young people from socially disadvantaged families to spend periods of study abroad, whereas those that can already afford it receive the grant on top."
"There is one area where we would like the programme to be expanded, and I would ask for your support here."
"We would like to provide funding under Comenius to encourage the use of young unemployed teachers in neighbouring countries for fixed periods."
"This would help to europeanise education and would help young unemployed teachers to get their first break in working life."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo II is designed not just to supplement the Member States' vocational training initiatives at European level, but actually to advance them."
"We must continue to develop a Europe of knowledge and a Europe of innovation in research, development and education, which are both absolutely vital if we are to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"However, Commissioner, whether the ECU 1 billion allocated for the years 2000 to 2004 will be enough is extremely doubtful in view of our enlargement plans, and this is why we are calling for a budget procedure in which the funding is fixed every year."
"We are also calling for the Leonardo programme to be extended until 2006 with a suitably increased level of funding."
"To increase effectiveness, the funding should be linked to other European measures."
"The new Structural Funds, Community initiatives, the Socrates and Youth for Europe education programmes, the reduction in the number of programme objectives from 19 to 3 and in the number of areas of action from 23 to 6 - these are more than numerical changes, they all mean that greater effectiveness is required."
"Sound basic vocational training should develop knowledge, for example of working with the new information and communication technologies."
"Practice with teamwork, group learning processes and good problem-solving skills all equip young people for future jobs."
"They need better access to working life from their initial training onwards, and all ages need access to good-quality further training in accordance with the concept of lifelong learning."
"There is still a tendency to undervalue or even to despise the experience that comes with age, although many young people could benefit from it."
"It is up to us to ensure that older workers remain motivated and active."
"If we invest enough in vocational training in the long term, the people of Europe will have a better chance of being able to compete at international level and, equally importantly, of strengthening social cohesion."
"Mrs Waddington has produced another excellent report which incorporates almost all the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party."
"I therefore hope that she will also accept our most recent amendments, in which we underline the importance of Leonardo for further and continuing vocational training."
"We agree that the vocational training systems should focus on reintegration into working life and integration into working processes for those with inadequate or outdated skills."
"Leonardo is based on Article 127, the cooperation procedure, and Socrates on Article 126, the codecision procedure."
"There is an imbalance here."
"Leonardo, which covers vocational education, and Socrates, which covers education in general, must surely have the same status."
"Human resources will always be our greatest source of potential, and they must be constantly encouraged, including through vocational training."
"Let us hope that Leonardo II will succeed in further developing individual flexibility and personal development into the 21st century."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone acknowledges that education and training affect economic competitiveness and progress."
"A further consideration for us as Europeans is that if unification is to happen, we must also try to ensure that young people have the chance to experience what Europe is."
"This is the most important task that faces us in our work on Europe's education policy."
"I support the demands for more funding, though I do not want to say much on the subject, but I would like to go back to what someone said about 'fine words'."
"There has not been a single summit that has not called for more funding for education and research, yet what happens in practice is quite different."
"I think we really need to insist that the heads of government get a little more out of their finance ministers, because education is a field where work needs to be both extended and intensified."
"At home in Austria, for example, there was for three years a very dramatic increase in the trend towards internationalisation among students, though this has tailed off slightly in the meantime."
"We must try to encourage this, and it is vital that more resources should be provided so that the applicant countries can take part in the process."
"Their students too must be able to experience their future in Europe."
"More intensive language training is absolutely essential here, of course, and every ECU is money well spent on the future political and economic stability of the Member States."
"However, there are a number of very specific practical problems."
"I am told time and time again that the information provided by the national bureaux sometimes leaves much to be desired, and that information is often not getting though in Europe's universities."
"Commissioner, we need to examine whether they really are all linked up and whether they really have the most up-to-date information to pass on to their students."
"There are also a few other major practical difficulties, such as social security problems, particularly in the field of health care."
"Accommodation is another recurring and extremely practical problem."
"Perhaps a European initiative to create a common infrastructure dealing specifically with accommodation issues could be of help here."
"Education is a task for Europe."
"It goes without saying that Europe is an education community."
"Let us act accordingly and provide the necessary resources for it."
"It is money well spent!"
"Mr President, we know that good vocational training is a factor in preventing unemployment."
"It does not create jobs as such, but it is vitally important in the current situation of mass unemployment among young people in particular."
"European programmes are no substitute for Member States attending to their domestic responsibilities."
"What they do is to exploit the genuine added value of the European dimension in the Luxembourg process which forms part of Europe's employment policy, in progress towards a knowledge-based society that can learn from cooperation precisely because of Europe's diversity, and in opening up a Europe-wide wealth of experience."
"We need to make the programmes less bureaucratic."
"We do not need to renationalise them."
"Our aim must be to spend 1 % of the budget of the European Union on vocational training proper, because this is investing in the future rather than spending on consumption."
"The Green Group has tabled some amendments to Mrs Waddington's very fine report, on the issues of second courses of training, accompanying research and opening up the programme to the third sector."
"There is one further comment that I feel I have to make, however, before I finish."
"There is a shadow over these excellent programmes that we are discussing today, Mrs Cresson."
"Please, put your house in order so that your successor can really push ahead with implementing the improved Leonardo programme, and I support Mrs Waddington's appeals to Mr Santer to do everything he can to help you in this."
"Mr President, I shall not be able to comment on all the excellent reports we have heard today, since time is short and I wish to focus in particular on the programmes concerned with young people."
"Our group expressly endorses the suggestions which the rapporteur has made."
"It would be good to have more money, but above all the money needs to be spent in a more balanced manner."
"I was shocked, Commissioner, to learn how much money had been given to voluntary work in connection with the France '98 World Cup."
"I wonder whether that is the right way to be using money of this kind, and whether voluntary work should be looking in the first instance at such public relations activities being pursued by an organisation which is ultimately out to make a profit."
"I must stress the importance of youth programmes if the idea of European citizenship is to flourish."
"Most of us grew up in an atmosphere of Euro-optimism."
"For today's young people, that is not necessarily the case."
"We have to learn a different way of awakening young people's interest in building Europe."
"That way is through enabling young people to have contact with other young Europeans, transcending national borders, transcending language differences, transcending cultural differences."
"So it is important that the players in that field who can work with us are encouraged to continue their efforts: local authorities and organisations."
"But we must also bear in mind young people who are not part of organised structures and who are thus very hard to reach through local authorities and organisations."
"I appreciate the position of the many honourable Members who advocate vocational training here."
"I have every sympathy with it."
"But practical experience of exchanges shows that youth exchanges entailing vocational training cause far more problems for young people than student exchanges, perhaps because the language is much less of a problem for student exchanges than for young people undergoing vocational training."
"Like the rapporteur, I am therefore in favour of a broad youth programme which is sure to take account of the overall cultural dimension, so that a firm foundation can be laid for European citizenship and enthusiasm about Europe."
"Mr President, in the new proposals from the Commission, who would not welcome the efforts made to ensure that the programmes do not overlap, to make them more consistent, to define more precise objectives and to improve the assessment on the ground? Similarly, who would not welcome the efforts made to respect the principle of subsidiarity, that is, only proposing Community action where it has a genuine European added value beyond what we are doing in our various countries?"
"Personally speaking, I also welcome the fact that we are extending the Leonardo and Socrates programmes to include adults as well as young people."
"The distinction between young people and adults is arbitrary to begin with and, what is more, we know that lifelong learning is vital."
"As far as the Youth programme is concerned, I admit that it is difficult to decide on how to share the funding between the European Voluntary Service and the Youth for Europe programme since there are arguments for both sides, and I am aware that the current distribution is very strongly criticised by some of my colleagues."
"Is a short stay in a foreign country beneficial for young people, even if there are a greater number of young people involved and if the contact is more superficial?"
"We can certainly wonder about this."
"A much longer stay, and a much longer experience, such as that involved in the voluntary service, is more expensive; however, it does have more of an impact. It is therefore difficult to come to a decision;"
"I believe that the best idea would be to find a new balance."
"Nonetheless, besides these almost minor points - what I was almost going to call 'the small print' - I seriously wonder about the philosophy behind these programmes."
"We sometimes have very different ideas, ladies and gentlemen, of what the construction of Europe should involve, this joint European adventure into which our countries have launched themselves, and the group I belong to is more aware of this than any other. We must nevertheless spend more time reflecting together, with a view to reaching common ideas to improve the thinking behind the youth programmes."
"You will be not surprised if I criticise the expression 'promoting European citizenship', an expression that is always used but never defined."
"However, I am convinced that European culture must pay more attention to liberal education and that is why I have been politically active since I was 18, as the first time I came to Brussels and to Strasbourg was because I was in charge of a newspaper in my school and we had a European meeting on this issue. This liberal education is extremely necessary as a basis for technical training, for vocational training and to ensure that exchanges are successful."
"To my mind, this point is essential if we are genuinely to improve our youth programmes."
"Mr President, in her opening remarks Mrs Pack said that we should not just try to unite states but to unite human beings."
"As we enlarge the European Union this is vital."
"We now need real action not just fine words."
"Others have spoken of the budget for this programme and I would like to say just one thing about it."
"If we were to spend as much money looking after students and teachers as we do looking after wealthy farmers it would be a better use of European money."
"I hope we will move towards that in the future."
"I want to make three clear points."
"The first is on the recognition of qualifications."
"We have to do a lot more to make sure that European schools, colleges and educational establishments are playing by our rules and abiding by what we are setting out as our objectives."
"Too many at the moment are not prepared to accept the talents of their colleagues from other countries on a par with those in their own states."
"That is a detrimental step."
"Secondly, learning languages is absolutely crucial to the peoples of Europe."
"It is important that we recognise other people's languages, especially minority ones."
"This is even more so as we move towards enlarging the Union."
"For example, we must accept the right of applicant states to use their own languages."
"We should be encouraging Western European students to learn Polish or Czech as much as we encourage their young people to learn English or German."
"Finally, we must ensure that money from Socrates and the other programmes does not go disproportionately into the pockets and budgets of those who already have."
"We need to ensure that the money from Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe goes to the poorer students, the ethnic minority students and the disadvantaged."
"At the moment, because of the bureaucracy and the procedures for application in some countries, the money is finding its way disproportionately into middle class and wealthy areas."
"I welcome these projects very much and hope the Commission will do more to ensure that the education euros really do reach more Europeans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the youth programmes we are discussing here have long been one of the European Union's success stories and will probably continue to be so for some time to come."
"Even though people in general seem to have boundless enthusiasm for travelling, more and more young people are preferring to find out about other countries by taking part in practical projects or doing part of their training there."
"But on the subject of this approach, I would also like to speak up on behalf of those who perhaps do not belong to the group described by Mr Evans, because we also need to think about having potential leaders in future with a far-sighted view of Europe, who can take responsibility for others."
"It is, however, the language requirements that I think should be given top priority."
"As I see it, the current proposal does not involve the Member States enough."
"This subject is dealt with in recital 13a. We must continue to insist that the Member States must share responsibility here, because this could make it easier for us to attain the level of funding needed."
"Although we have a very positive impression of how the programmes are coming along, the funding aspect is still extremely important, because if we work it out, as Mrs Pack mentioned in her speech, it comes to about ECU 3 for each young person involved."
"Much more money than this is provided in other areas - it does not have to be agriculture, which my colleague mentioned, the MEDA programme is just another example among many."
"As the deputy chairman of the Malta delegation, however, I have to say that I am extremely surprised that there is no suggestion of including Malta more closely in the programmes."
"The university there is preparing for involvement, the young people are expecting it, and we really cannot hold them to their two-year government's decision to put the programmes on ice."
"Mr President, I want to welcome the Leonardo II programme, in particular the report introduced by Mrs Waddington this morning which, as usual, is excellent."
"I must say that Mrs Waddington is one of those rare Members who actually writes most of her own reports and drafts her own amendments, unlike many other Members, including myself."
"She is therefore a respected expert in this field."
"It is unfortunate that she is being placed in a position where she may not come back to this House next year."
"New Labour clearly does not respect her as much as Members in this House."
"Incidentally, I was interested to note that the House of Lords may be reversing the system."
"The Leonardo II programme is very important, not least because it should be at the centre of a European Union strategy to combat unemployment, education and training."
"Vocational training in particular, to make the European labour force more effective and more employable, is the key to the full employment strategy which should be now at the centre of the European Union strategy."
"This is particularly so since the great victory of the Red/Greens in Germany has shifted Europe to the left and left Mr Blair as the last reactionary force on the right of Europe."
"Oh, heckling!"
"Mr President, please protect me against these Members who are intervening against me."
"The measures in Leonardo are very important."
"However, the monitoring and evaluation done on Leonardo I raises serious problems and I hope that Mrs Cresson will respond to the queries made to her."
"So far she has not done so."
"And I hope President Santer will respond to the queries made to him and take seriously the important questions raised over the administration and the budget on Leonardo I and make sure that Leonardo II is a better managed programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this joint debate on Socrates and Leonardo gives us an opportunity to assess and above all to compare progress to date in the two programmes."
"The Socrates programme, which covers education in general, has done very well: 500 000 students, 30 000 language teachers and the many other young people who have taken advantage of the programme paint a very positive picture, and in view of this excellent result it seems only logical to continue to provide funding."
"However, the vocational training measures under the Leonardo programme are very definitely on the minus side, and when I say this I do not mean that I think the programme is fundamentally bad or ill-conceived, but in practice it has presented complex administrative problems."
"So if we are wondering why the programmes have been assessed so differently, the answer is quite simple: in the area of practical vocational training, theoretical programmes soon reach their limits, and those who take part will only benefit from the added value if they can actually do something with the practical experience they have gained."
"I think that changes will have to be made here in future."
"Mr President, many very important and accurate comments have been made today about the importance of the education programmes."
"I would stress that it is vital that we facilitate and broaden access to the education programmes in general, particularly for young people from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and those from socially weaker groups which tend not to have access to education."
"The education and youth programmes clearly demonstrate European added value and have a multiplier effect, while at the same time preparing young people to be mobile and to be involved in the Europe of knowledge."
"The Leonardo programme facilitates the development of specialised knowledge in Europe about vocational training and increases mobility."
"The Socrates programme, having gone through a highly successful first phase of promoting European cooperation in university education, school education and language teaching, is now to be extended to cover adult education and those who left school without qualifications."
"It is also important that all young people in Europe should attain a basic level of knowledge."
"I therefore feel, like previous speakers, particularly Mrs Pack, that the call from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for funding for the Socrates programme to be increased from ECU 1.4 billion to ECU 2 billion is the most important of its demands."
"It is also important for the Youth for Europe programme to have its funding increased from ECU 600 million to ECU 800 million if we really want to try to double the number of young people involved, which is the Commission's aim."
"It is absolutely essential if structures are to be simplified and communication improved."
"I would like to thank our colleagues, particularly Mrs Waddington and Mrs Pack, for producing their opinions so quickly, with the result that we will now probably be able to have a first common position during the Austrian Presidency."
"I was particularly pleased that at the informal meeting of ministers in Baden there was already broad agreement on increasing funding and on the fact that the education programmes should be less bureaucratic, more transparent and more decentralised. I therefore hope that there can now be fruitful cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission for the benefit of education in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulated Mrs Pack in this Chamber last year and I renew those congratulations."
"This second phase of Socrates, the Community action programme for education, seeks to resolve two of the main obstacles encountered in the first phase: insufficient financial resources and coordination and information difficulties between Member States, Commission and citizens."
"It is therefore important to increase the financial allocation for the period 2000-2004 to ECU 2 billion, and to simplify management and application procedures at the same time."
"It is essential to pursue the programme's aim of promoting quality in education by encouraging cooperation, intensifying mobility and developing the European dimension in all sectors of education."
"Socrates is the touchstone of a policy intended to bring the European Union and its citizens together, and it is making a crucial contribution to the progressive construction of a European education area."
"Furthermore, exchanges of information and experience on problems of common interest relating to education are vital if we are to guarantee any one of the cooperation activities provided for in the various measures."
"In particular, this includes Ortelius, the database on higher education in the fifteen Member States of the European Union which DGXXII and the Council of Ministers has wanted ever since 1993, because it is the only database in the world permitting integrated recovery, through a single question and a cross-referenced search, of information on different educational situations, thus bringing together information dispersed across the net."
"Finally, I want to thank Mr De Coene for emphasising the need to establish a better balance between the European Voluntary Service and the other actions, coordinating and integrating them, and counteracting their tendency to fragmentation."
"The Youth programme combining Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service can play a decisive role in resolving issues linked to individualism, nationalism, insecurity and distrust of one's fellow man."
"Mr President, with the new phase of the three Community programmes devoted to education, training and youth, we have a great opportunity to invest, at European level, in the development of human resources, especially amongst the younger generations."
"We are very well aware that these programmes are not intended to replace individual national policies - which should be strengthened by them - but to become an important reference point both in developing the transnational dimension in human resources actions, and in the ongoing process of reforming the education systems in all the Member States."
"As regards the Youth programme, the Commission's proposal, as amended by Parliament, will represent an important development in the opportunities offered both to young people individually and to groups of young people."
"Transnational exchanges, informal education, voluntary work and support for youth creativity are the planks of a programme which could really become a great opportunity for individual and collective growth for the young people of our continent."
"In particular, the European Voluntary Service, which has already proved itself in previous years, is destined to become one of the pillars of Community policies to develop European citizenship and affirm the practice of informal education."
"But, all in all, we are asking for the three programmes to be adequately funded to ensure that the resources available are enough to meet their needs."
"So Parliament is placing major emphasis on the need to simplify the management of the programmes and cut down on bureaucracy so that access to them is guaranteed to all - to young people, to associations and to training and education institutions."
"Only by putting our money on the energy and intelligence of young people, and the world of education and training, will we be able to build a fair, democratic and effective Europe which is worth working for."
"Mr President, exchange programmes in the EU for young students and researchers are one of the most important Community policies aimed specifically at our citizens and which serve to promote free movement."
"The significance of the exchange programmes in relation, for example, to the process of Union enlargement or the aim of equivalence in qualifications cannot be overstated."
"I believe it is important to increase funding for Union exchange programmes, and it is a positive step that the Commission communication on a Europe of knowledge and skills recognises the need for additional funding."
"The participation of eastern European countries in exchange programmes in particular will put pressure on the funding framework, and there is a danger that the present citizens of the Union will have to settle for a much smaller share of funding than now as compared to the lion's share the EU applicant countries stand to receive."
"It is vital to ensure that young people continue to be involved in the preparation of programmes, and the Commission must see to it that the voice of those participating in programmes makes itself heard in the working parties which decide on programme form and content."
"In this way we can ensure that the programmes will continue to be popular in the future."
"Finally, my thanks to the rapporteurs for their commendable work."
"Mr President, this is the first time that these three programmes have been bunched together in this way, creating a Europe of knowledge."
"Its importance I hope is that it will provide a degree of flexibility between the Youth for Europe, Socrates and Leonardo programmes."
"One of the problems we had in the past was a lack of flexibility."
"We have tried to add to the possibility of fluidity between the programmes by creating the Connect line within the budget so we should be able to create better links."
"These are three of the most successful programmes within the European Union but it is important for us to analyse who they have been successful for, who have been the participants."
"I would like to focus on one programme in particular and one aspect of that programme: The Erasmus programme within the Socrates Programme."
"This deals with student exchanges."
"The Union has helped thousands of young people to gain experience in studying abroad."
"Originally it was forecast that approximately ECU 5 000 per person would be available."
"The reality is that there has only been ECU 70."
"This is a joke; nobody can live on it."
"So the parents have had to contribute and inadvertently we have created an elitist programme."
"The most important amendment to the Socrates report is that which emphasises the need to select students on the basis of the financial needs of applicants as well as merit."
"We do not just want rich students to have access to this programme."
"That is not to say that other people cannot participate."
"We want up to 10 % of EU students to participate and they can gain the prestige of being a part of this programme."
"But, the money should be targeted at those who need it."
"We need more money."
"That is the important point."
"ECU 2 billion is what we are going to fight for and the fight will commence now."
"Mr President, Commissioner, some young people who came to Parliament this week asked me 'Where is the spirit of Europe?'."
"The answer is to be found in the new education and youth programmes, I told them, and Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe combined with the voluntary service activities are all making a very important contribution to developing the synergy of the European spirit."
"There need to be strong links with the Structural Funds and Hughes-Start, and the aim is to integrate young people into European society, to combat the unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment, to promote cultural understanding in the Union, education in tolerance and solidarity, equal opportunities for boys and girls and to fight against racism and xenophobia."
"Those are our objectives, now it is up to us to prepare the young people of Europe to meet them."
"The capital that we invest in them, as tomorrow's achievers, is our best economic investment for the future."
"This is why it is a mistake to think that we do not need to spend more money on the culture and education programmes."
"As long as we continue to regard olive plantations as more important than young people, we are barking up the wrong tree."
"We need to change the way we think."
"Mr President, for Europe to respond to the needs of young people it has to be in touch with what those needs are."
"A young British student expressed them to me when he said: 'We have all heard of the three 'Es' - education, education, education."
"But I think young people want the four 'Es' - education, employment, environment and Europe'."
"I think he is spot-on."
"The first three may well be self-explanatory."
"The fourth 'E', Europe, in my country sometimes seems a less obvious choice."
"I would argue that the major reason for Europe's importance to young people is precisely because it has a fundamental role to play in the quality of assurance of the first three 'Es' and also for creating the opportunities of the single market."
"In Britain alone some 200 000 young people are set to benefit directly from the EU initiatives over the next five years."
"But the demand for places still far outweigh the supply."
"Other organisations in Member States are needed to pick up where the EU has shown the way."
"I would cite a charity, Trident Transnational, of which I am a trustee."
"This organises work placements and vocational training for 150 000 students each year."
"That is only one-third of the half a million or so young people who either go to the UK or leave the UK on work placement schemes."
"The EU should certainly not think it must do all this itself but encourage and facilitate others in doing the work we believe in."
"If we want the single market to be truly functional and the right to work across Europe to be meaningful, a period of study or work across Europe should not just provide an opportunity to experience the way of life in another country but should be to get a tangible qualification."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs on the reports we are debating in the House today."
"I believe Parliament should determine to make youth one of the priorities for Europe, because young people represent the present and the future of our Union."
"We have before us today proposals which amount to a genuine rethink of Community programmes in the fields of education, training and youth for the period 2000-2004. We should rejoice in them."
"A great deal of experience has been gained in these areas. Taking all of it into account, I think we should make the most of the opportunity to make the fresh start which this new programme 'Youth' represents."
"In the Committee on Culture, we have tried to produce a report which takes into account young people's concerns and which responds to their requests."
"We have made every effort to provide young people with opportunities to travel in order to learn each others' languages and broaden their horizons. We have also emphasised the importance of new technology."
"Our citizens need to be well informed if they are to play a full part in the building of the new Europe. This is precisely what the new programme, 'Youth', aims to achieve."
"Only then can people set to work and take advantage of the opportunities now available."
"In my opinion, ladies and gentlemen, this new programme, 'Youth', is even more open to the young people of Europe as a whole."
"It enables young Europeans to come together, whatever their origin, and learn to value each other whilst respecting their cultural, linguistic and social differences. In short, it will foster what we in the European Union hold dear: greater tolerance amongst the young people of Europe."
"Implementation of this programme will allow young people to learn to live together. It will also develop their initiative."
"This will be excellent training for the economic world of the future in which the young will have to play their part. This opportunity for our young people must be supported by the House, together with its specific objectives: the development of solidarity, and guaranteeing and enhancing every aspect of European citizenship."
"The programme also allows young people to absorb a range of values which will create a sense of belonging to a common social and cultural area."
"Parliament's position has played a large part in setting the proposed budget for these programmes."
"As a result, twice the number of young people as were involved in previous ventures of this nature will benefit from the actions in this programme. A total of some 130 000 young people will gain from it."
"In the Committee on Culture we tried to share the budget fairly amongst the various actions in the programme. We have taken account of research, management structures and young people's groups who have explained to us what they really need."
"As you will gather from what I have already said, I believe that thanks to all the political groups working so well together, and to the rapporteur's flexibility, we have produced a helpful amendment to the Commission's text. On behalf of the People's Party, I therefore ask you to support this programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this sitting of the European Parliament marks a very important stage in the adoption of decisions for the new generation of action programmes in the field of education, training and youth."
"I would like to firstly congratulate and thank Parliament's rapporteurs, Mrs Pack for the Socrates programme, Mrs Waddington for Leonardo da Vinci, and Mr De Coene for the action programme on youth. I would like to thank them for their commitment and for the quality of their work in furthering this debate within Parliament and presenting their reports at this sitting."
"I would also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinions of the various committees involved, particularly Mrs Guinebertière, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, Mr Virrankoski, Mr Papakyriazis and Mr Christodoulou."
"Thanks to their efforts, you can give your opinion during this same sitting on the reports relating to the three programmes."
"In my opinion, it is very important that these issues are being considered at the same time."
"This confirms my desire to develop an integrated approach, through these three proposals, that contributes to the construction of a Europe of knowledge that is open to all citizens, and particularly young people."
"I must highlight, too, the very positive attitude of the Presidency towards moving the work forward at Council level and ensuring the maximum collaboration among the three specialist preparatory groups and with Parliament."
"I think that the cooperation established between the institutions in order to move the negotiations forward under the best possible conditions sets a fine example."
"In this context, the Commission believes that most of the amendments tabled add more precision, and even strengthen Community action in the fields of education, training and youth; we will thus be able to take them over."
"As a result, we accept, in full or in part, 33 amendments for Socrates, 42 amendments for Leonardo and 36 amendments for the youth programme."
"There are a few sensitive points that I would like to look at in more detail."
"First, I think that the high political profile of the programmes must result in clear and concise objectives."
"We have made an effort in our proposals to concentrate the objectives and give them a specific meaning."
"I would like each programme to have a reduced number of objectives which will then be the messages that the Union sends out to European citizens to explain its action."
"And I accept the amendments that go in this direction."
"In this respect, I would emphasise the importance of the provisions that are common to the three programmes."
"They are a sign of their contribution to the construction of a Europe of knowledge and to the development of a European education area."
"Similarly, the three programmes must help to remove the legal or administrative obstacles that stand in the way of the transnational mobility of young people or people undergoing training, and I accept the amendments that strengthen these provisions."
"I think it is important to enhance the programmes' complementarity with the Structural Funds with a view to developing and broadening the scale of the results obtained within the framework of the programmes, particularly Socrates and Leonardo."
"I also entirely share Parliament's concerns and the proposals it has made to improve the assessment of the programmes, both from the point of view of the measures taken at Community level, and as regards their effect in modernising education and training systems."
"The amendments that we cannot accept are mainly of an institutional nature, in other words those relating to the rules governing comitology, for example, the procedures for consulting the Community institutions, external policy or the budgetary rules."
"As regards the duration of the programmes, the Commission has taken account of past experience and proposed a duration of five years."
"The aim here is to find a fair balance between the need for the programmes to have stability over a period of time, so as to facilitate work, and the need to ensure that the objectives and procedures for Community action do not become bogged down during an excessively long period."
"I believe that a duration of five years strikes the right balance."
"I note Parliament's support for an increase in budgetary allocations to these programmes."
"The experience of recent years has shown that, as several speakers here have pointed out, more and more people are applying to take part in these programmes, both from teaching and training establishments and from bodies working with young people or involved in young people's issues, as well as European citizens themselves."
"During the vote on the budget each year Parliament has shown constant support for this issue."
"The Commission's budgetary proposals represent a very significant increase and confirm the political priority these programmes are being given, while respecting the constraints of the financial perspective, particularly item 3."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission and Parliament share the same desire to increase the budgetary resources in order to satisfy the ambitions of the programmes."
"I hope that the rest of the negotiation process will allow the Council to give a similar opinion in this respect."
"Apart from these general comments on the three programmes, I must make a number of specific observations."
"In the framework of the Socrates programme, we accept many amendments designed to strengthen the Commission's proposal, and these can be incorporated either as they are, or in spirit."
"In particular, I would mention here the amendments relating to the target figure for the number of people in the group the programme hopes to reach; the principle of integrating the equal opportunities dimension in all the measures supported, including through the use of positive actions; the fact that priority is to be given, when allocating Erasmus grants, to students with particular financial difficulties; and the increased use of the European Community Course Credit Transfer System (ECTS) in the field of higher education."
"I would like to say a few words on Erasmus and, to repeat what was said earlier, I would point out that it is not an elitist programme."
"It reflects the reality of the student population in the Member States."
"The Commission has always tried to ensure that the relevant authorities in the Member States give grants to the less privileged students and the results of the survey currently being carried out on the economic and social situation in this respect will be forwarded to Parliament next February."
"I agree with the proposal to call Action 5 on multimedia 'Minerva', and thereby to have a female name associated with an education programme."
"However, I cannot accept certain amendments that could limit the development of joint actions between the programmes and with other Community actions."
"I must stress the importance of these joint actions: these new provisions allow us to combine the resources of the three programmes and of other actions that contribute to the construction of a Europe of knowledge."
"In the case of Leonardo, we welcome the fact that an explicit reference is made to NGOs to facilitate their access to the programmes, but for comitology reasons they cannot actually be included in the committee."
"Moreover, we accept the proposal to strengthen the general principle of non-discrimination in terms of access to the programmes, but without refocusing access on specific target groups."
"I must also point out that the Commission agrees with the rapporteur that more attention must be given to equal opportunities."
"In answer to the questions by Mr Wolf and Mr Kerr about information on the administration of Leonardo, I would point out that I referred the matter to financial control at the beginning of the year."
"As a precaution, pending the results of the examination, I suspended all contract operations for the projects selected following the 1997 call for proposals."
"When the checks were completed, financial control noted that there had not been a conflict of interests and my services were able to issue financial agreements for all the projects selected."
"Financial control also authorised the renewal, for the third year, of the projects selected in 1995."
"As regards the more general audit of the administration of the programme, the financial control report has still not been finalised."
"I am waiting until I receive this report before deciding what corrective measures might be needed."
"On the subject of the Youth programme, the Commission accepts all the amendments relating to promoting genuine European citizenship and the ideals of democracy, tolerance and cohesion in the construction of Europe, which were highlighted, in particular, by Mr De Coene. We also accept those highlighting the importance of information that allows us to reach all young people and the importance of ensuring that the programme is more accessible, as underlined by Mr De Coene and Mrs de Esteban."
"We welcome, too, the amendments on the specific efforts that must be made in order to provide for the creation of a structure aimed at promoting young people's projects, information, background material on youth and dialogue with all young people, as proposed by Mrs Guinebertière. Particularly important here is the plan to combine additional resources to help the integration of those young people who have most difficulty in participating in the programmes."
"Moreover, the use of the Internet, also proposed by Mrs Guinebertière, is a good idea to help young people gain access to the programme."
"In fact, we are already doing this, by way of the Eurodesk project. The proposal by Mrs Guinebertière strengthens our determination to develop these tools."
"I would like to clarify for Mrs Maes that the voluntary service is very successful with young people."
"Those young people who participated in the organisation of the World Cup were, in general, from less privileged groups."
"They were very enthusiastic about taking part in this unique experience that took place right at the end of their stay, which itself involved working in sports establishments of their choice."
"However, the Commission has not been able to approve the amendments changing the age range and limiting youth contribution to the construction of Europe."
"Specifically, we accept some of the amendments in full or in part."
"For Socrates, this means Amendments Nos 2 to 8, 10 to 13, 18, 20 to 23, 25, 27, 29 to 39, 41, 42, 44 and 46."
"For Leonardo, we accept Amendments Nos 1 to 5, 7 and 8, 11 to 19, 22 to 24, 27, 29 to 35, 37 and 38, 41 and 42, 46 and 47, 49 to 55, 57 and 58."
"For the Youth programme, we accept Amendments Nos 1 to 15, 17 to 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28 to 31, 34, 36, 39 to 42, 46, 49, 52, 57 and 59."
"As a follow-up to Parliament's reports on the three programmes, we are putting forward amended proposals based on the amendments tabled by Parliament."
"They can therefore be taken into consideration in the common positions that the Council will adopt during the Youth Council on 26 November, and during the Education Council on 4 December."
"In conclusion, I must point out that, in my opinion, we are well on the way to enabling Parliament to proceed to its second reading before the end of the parliamentary term."
"This is important as it will allow you to continue to provide, to the very end, the continuous political support that Parliament has given to these programmes, which directly affect citizens and provide them with specific opportunities to participate in the Europe of knowledge that we have begun to build together."
"It will also allow us to prepare the implementation of the programmes during 1999 under optimum conditions, so that they will be ready for launching on 1 January 2000."
"Mr President, I simply wanted to raise an issue that Madam Cresson referred to but since she missed my opening speech she did not respond to it."
"We were very pleased to hear the point she made about the audit of Leonardo but I would make a request to her that she come to the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment to discuss with us the findings of that audit on Leonardo I."
"Mr President, I should like to put a comment to the Commissioner."
"The best way to enable young people to find employment is to ensure that they are qualified for the right jobs."
"We now know that the majority of young people, 80 %, obtain qualifications for only 11 types of work, which drastically reduces their chances of finding a first job."
"This is why I would suggest that transnational analyses should be carried out to identify what types of work are in demand in the medium and long terms."
"This is an idea worth supporting, because this is what makes young people decide on what skills to learn."
"Would you consider pushing this analysis through, so that young people can finally concentrate on obtaining qualifications in types of work where there are actually jobs to be had?"
"Mr President, I would firstly like to apologise to Mrs Waddington."
"I was indeed a few minutes late and did not have the pleasure of hearing her speech."
"As regards the Leonardo audit and the question of my coming to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, this is a proposal that I fully agree with and I will be coming to the committee to discuss this problem as soon as possible."
"As regards what Mr Pirker said, it is true that we must ensure that our young people are qualified for the jobs on offer today."
"Guiding young people is a serious problem since, given the extremely rapid developments in technology, we are not entirely aware of exactly what qualifications are going to be required."
"I also believe that nothing can replace solid, basic training and good guidance. And I would like to point out to him that these transnational analyses, which help us to discover what jobs will be most accessible, already exist in the Commission for the social affairs sector."
"But we can, of course, focus our efforts more on these problems and I am quite open to any suggestions that might be made in this respect."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Work-linked training"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0374/98), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0418/98-97/0321(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the promotion of European pathways in work-linked training, including apprenticeship (Rapporteur: Mr Castagnetti)."
"Mr President, the initiative on European pathways in work-linked training ties in very well with this morning's speeches on educational programmes. If I may say so, this is an initiative which goes beyond the exchange of information and experience."
"It offers an opportunity for real experience, and diversified, alternative training pursued in different geographic areas. It is a response to the request for new ideas we are hearing from the young people of Europe, and in a sense it is a metaphor for the training of tomorrow in Europe."
"I said European pathways, and I want to emphasise that: these are not just national any more."
"We emphasise the idea of pathways."
"On the subject of the common position, we, the European Parliament, mainly stress the value of the pathway and not just the final certificate, the Europass."
"It is true that the Treaty protects the individuality and autonomy of the various national training systems, but it is also true that in a Europe of free movement of persons, with young people independent and eager for training, some national rigidity needs to give way so that a start can be made on at least some common training pathways."
"So we appreciate the fact that, in the common position, the Council did not make significant changes to the text which emerged from the first reading and actually accepted that this work-linked training pathways initiative applies not just to countries which provide for training experiences abroad, but to the whole of the territory of the Union, to all the countries which voluntarily agree to adopt this initiative."
"Because we appreciate these points in the common position we have lessened the thrust of our amendments, because we really want to get this text approved quickly."
"We also appreciate the fact that the common position considers it useful for the Commission to play a part and not be excluded from the monitoring process or from establishing the principles common to this type of training experience."
"The Council has partially taken on board the idea of preparation and information measures which young people taking part in this experience need."
"In committee we also accepted some amendments tabled by Mrs Waddington, whom I would like to thank, primarily regarding occupational safety requirements."
"The Commission's text, as confirmed by the European Parliament at first reading, set out certain objectives: defining the content and common principles of the European pathway and establishing the final document, the Europass."
"It is true that the Council rejected the first of these objectives but that does not remove the need to ensure that the certificate complies with common principles. That is how the amendments we approved in committee should be understood, particularly Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and 9."
"We have also revived the issue of the European pathway: without distorting the intention of the common position we have in a sense strengthened it, with a few fairly modest amendments designed to restore and enhance the value of the European pathway, and not just the Europass."
"So we trust that these amendments, unanimously approved by our parliamentary committee, will finally be accepted by the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr Castagnetti for his report and for being prepared to take on board so many of my amendments in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment."
"We believe that one important means of encouraging people to take part in a period of worked-linked training in another Member State is to ensure that experience is validated and recognised across the European Union."
"This is really one of the most significant aspects of the scheme."
"We in this Parliament want to ensure the quality of these experiences and the quality of the validation."
"To support and encourage such opportunities requires considerable preparation by all the partners involved and the proposals that the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment have resubmitted provide the key elements for such preparation."
"For example, the trainees themselves need preparation, including an awareness of the health and safety risks in a new and unfamiliar environment."
"Accidents often occur when young people are unfamiliar with their working environment and to move and work in another European country may create more dangers."
"So it is important that the health and safety risks are taken on board."
"It is also important that the social partners at the European and enterprise level are fully involved and consulted and that all the potential beneficiaries, enterprises and trainers are aware of the possibilities so that they can themselves inform others."
"These are important aspects of quality and enabling of mobility."
"We hope that the Commission and Council will take them on board."
"Mr President, I welcome the communication from the Commission on the promotion of apprenticeship schemes, which would have a considerable impact in reducing youth unemployment."
"In Sweden there are virtually no apprenticeship schemes, but at the beginning of the 1990s work-linked training was introduced in secondary schools, with 15 % of teaching being carried out in the workplace and the remainder in the classroom."
"Of course, it is up to Member States to devise apprenticeship schemes in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, but I still believe that it would be both positive and rewarding to establish common principles and also to have a EUROPASS."
"I share Mr Castagnetti's view that too much attention has been focused on EUROPASS Training at the expense of the European pathways."
"We therefore support the report as amended by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Mr President, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, some apprentices are future specialised workers and others are future entrepreneurs, provided that their training is practical and in line with economic requirements."
"The basic idea of allowing them to develop skills in other European countries too is to be welcomed, but I fear that it will prove very difficult to put this into practice in vocational training."
"There will be occupations for which it is entirely logical to obtain experience from other countries, such as chefs and waiters, for example."
"The added value of their experience ultimately benefits the firms to which they return, and this acts as an incentive for their bosses or those training them."
"But there will also be vocational fields where this is not so true, such as with business apprentices learning accountancy and wage clerking."
"How are they supposed to gain these skills abroad?"
"If we really want to bring the European project alive, we need to ensure that periods of training are comparable, otherwise only certain dual training sectors will be accepted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament, and particularly the rapporteur, Mr Castagnetti, for the support given to this proposal and for the amendments tabled at this second reading."
"Parliament proposes 21 amendments, and the Commission accepts 19 of them."
"These amendments improve and clarify the common position adopted by the Council and, at times, even strengthen it."
"We therefore accept the amendments aimed at guaranteeing that the duration is consistent with the objectives and the skills to be acquired under the European pathway, and ensuring that this is, in fact, a real training period."
"We also accept the amendments that aim to guarantee the provision of adequate information and broader accompanying measures in relation to the conditions under which the European pathway is completed, particularly as regards occupational health and safety, among other things, in cases where those undergoing training complete their European pathway in a company."
"I would like to thank Mrs Waddington for drawing my attention to this essential aspect, which is also a key factor in ensuring the success of the European pathway."
"In addition, we accept the amendments aimed at highlighting the role of the various partners, work-linked training and apprenticeships, and those that clarify the Commission's powers so that it can implement and assess the European pathways."
"These are the amendments we can accept."
"However, we cannot accept the amendments of a budgetary nature."
"But I can assure you that the proposals you make, particularly as regards how the decision on 'EUROPASS Training' ties in with the programme on vocational training, have been taken into consideration."
"In the Commission's proposal for the second stage of the Leonardo da Vinci programme, which is also on today's agenda, we have agreed to provide Community support for transnational placements and exchanges that are European pathways in work-linked training, including apprenticeship."
"In conclusion, we can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 5 and 7 to 20."
"On this basis, I plan to present, in the very near future, an amended proposal so that the final decision can be taken at the Social Affairs Council on 2 December, and so that in 1999 we might begin the preparatory work to implement this decision on 1 January 2000."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Thank you also for your patience."
"I must apologise for the noise in the Chamber."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, I had asked if I could raise a brief point of order before the vote on Rules 5 and 119."
"Normally I follow Mrs Fontaine's procedure in saying that, for reasons of principle and on fiscal grounds, I do not take part in roll-call votes."
"Today I have my reasons for saying that, so that it can be recorded in the Minutes."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, during this vote, you stated that the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations was responsible for having requested practically all the separate votes, and there seemed to be a somewhat negative connotation in that statement."
"I would like to congratulate you, on the one hand, on the attention you are paying to our group and the work it does. But, on the other hand, I must point out that, in fact, it was not our group that requested the votes in question, but the Union for Europe Group, so they should be the ones you pay tribute to."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, thank you for the correction."
"It is true that, indeed, it was not you who asked for a separate vote on this report, but the Union for Europe Group."
"In previous votes, however, it was you who asked for most of the separate votes."
"I said most of them."
"Mr President, unquestionably you have delivered an important speech."
"We should be grateful if you could repeat it, but I would like to hear it translated into Dutch."
"I am afraid my Greek is not up to following every last word of what you said."
"Mr Blokland, if at some time the Dutch booth was unable to follow me, thank you very much for letting me know."
"I would be very glad and willing, especially in view of our friendly relationship, to explain to you in detail what I said and what I meant after the end of the sitting."
"Mr President, I would like to explain that the reason why our group will be voting against these amendments, those relating to the free movement of people, is not because we disagree with the concepts they express."
"On the contrary, we agree completely."
"But to avoid confusion, we do not think that this should be included in a report dealing with the free movement of goods."
"Mr President, I am sure that the rapporteur will speak for himself but this group feels that it is important to mention the free movement of workers, but not necessarily in the main text."
"We will be voting that position."
"I should also like to make it known that our group opposes the Green Group amendments because they were not submitted in committee."
"If everyone submitted amendments directly to the plenary then plenary sessions would last 24 hours."
"Mr President, as I stated earlier, I wish to put forward an oral amendment, adding a further brief point to the draft legislative resolution. It reads as follows: 'Calls on the Commission to draw up as soon as possible a draft regulation effectively securing free movement of workers in the Member States of the European Union'."
"This amendment would be inserted after paragraph 3. I believe it would reflect the feeling that free movement of goods should be aligned with freedom of movement for workers, an issue on which the House is determined to make progress."
"Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, you did indeed submit that draft to the Bureau and I will bring it up for debate as soon as we get to the draft legislative resolution."
"What you have said has already made Parliament aware of the issue, but we will consider it at the appropriate time."
"I do not understand this, because we did not complain about this report being put on the agenda again at such short notice, although it is a point worth making again."
"There was a special new deadline for amendments, which we met, as far as I am aware, when we retabled some amendments from committee."
"I think it is quite unfair to tell us it cannot be done and that we have not acted correctly, and I would like to register a formal protest at the way in which this already difficult matter is being steamrollered through."
"Mr President, I should like it to be known that I am against any oral amendments tabled by any other group."
"We have had eight months to debate this report."
"Mr Skinner, we will consider that at the appropriate time, and you can declare your opposition then."
"Mr President, as has already been stated, the European People's Party supports the amendments concerning freedom of movement for workers."
"However, the House already has before it the proposal for the revision of Regulation No 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers, and in legal terms it does seem more logical for such amendments to be included in that proposal."
"Is there any objection to putting that oral amendment by the rapporteur to the vote?"
"Mr President, I thought you had announced that no oral amendments would be accepted during the sitting."
"I just wanted to remind you of the presidency's proposal."
"Mr Lataillade, I asked whether any Members objected to the rapporteur's oral amendment."
"There was no objection, so we will put it to the vote."
"Mr President, this is not an oral amendment, it is simply a matter of omitting part of the article."
"This can quite easily be done by having a separate vote."
"Mr Skinner is simply proposing that these five or six words be omitted, and we can vote separately on that."
"Mr von Wogau, this can be done in various ways, but the rapporteur preferred to submit an oral amendment, as was his right, and I am obliged to put it to the vote."
"You are right, he could have done it otherwise. However, he did it orally and Parliament accepted that."
"I will read out the text of the oral amendment in French:"
"'Calls on the Commission to draw up as soon as possible a draft regulation effectively securing free movement of workers in the Member States of the European Union'."
"Mr President, I am sure the rapporteur will accept this oral amendment, since the Socialist Group and our group have made the possibility of putting forward oral amendments into such a sensitive issue."
"I would like to ask the rapporteur, and Parliament too, of course, whether they agree that this oral amendment should be put to the vote."
"Mr President, in fact my oral amendment was to help your group."
"It was not to help my group.Your amendment was very good."
"I tried to help that."
"But I really cannot accept this amendment."
"We have already said enough about the free movement of workers as a political statement."
"In that respect I cannot support this oral amendment however good it might be."
"Is there any objection on the part of the House to my putting this oral amendment to the vote?"
"To establish that there is an objection, at least 12 Members must rise."
"(More than 12 Members rose, thereby expressing their objection) There is an objection. Consequently, I cannot put it to the vote."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, is being very unsporting."
"We are voting for his oral amendment."
"We are remaining seated and you are not."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I think that if we start debating about a sporting spirit in this House, we will run into major problems about who is and who is not sporting, and why."
"Let us go no further with that discussion."
"Mr President, I would like to support what the rapporteur has said, because as committee chairman I have only just received Mr García-Margallo's oral amendment."
"There are many directives on the free movement of workers in the European Union - we cannot talk about one directive, there are a great many of them on the subject."
"I think we should not take such decisions on the basis of oral amendments, so I tend to agree."
"Mr Skinner has already said that he will not accept an oral amendment on this question, which I think is sensible, and so the matter is settled."
"Mr von Wogau, ladies and gentlemen, we will not continue this discussion. I am very sorry."
"Everyone has a right to their own opinion and judgement, and of course others are entitled to agree or disagree."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I should like to comment as follows on the UPE Group's Amendment No 1 to this paragraph."
"Professor Cabrol thinks it is most important that a doctor should be consulted before a medicinal product is taken."
"I think we all agree on that."
"So I would suggest that we put in a combination of his amendment and my text, and if that is done I can support it."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"In our explanation of vote, we would like to stress our interest in the points made in the committee's report concerning the health and safety aspects for those involved in apprenticeship schemes and work-linked training."
"Mr President, during the vote on the Roth-Behrendt report what I actually wanted to do was to protest about the procedure."
"Indeed, I am not opposed to the proposal for a directive, which aims to eliminate the derogation for agricultural products and game in Article 2 of the Council Directive of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products."
"Moreover, I welcome the fact that Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7 were rejected by roll-call vote."
"Firstly, I disagree with Amendment No 3 because it removed the obligation of the injured party to provide proof of the defect or the causal relationship between defect and damage under certain circumstances, a rule that is not compatible with liability law."
"Similarly, I do not agree with Amendment No 4, which was rejected and which eliminated what is known as 'development risk', nor, finally, with Amendment No 7, which aimed to eliminate the limitation period of 10 years from the date on which the product is put on the market."
"However, I would like to repeat the concern expressed by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"These amendments, and others that were also rejected - much to my satisfaction - had no direct link with the committee."
"By allowing them to be put to the vote, without considering their admissibility, we were undoubtedly challenging the fact that Parliament does not have the right of initiative."
"I would point out that there is a discrepancy in the attitude that has been adopted by the Presidency's services in this case and their attitude in a recent report on the creation of the Anti-Fraud Office, for example."
"I do not think it was admissible - as Mr Casini points out in the opinion by the Committee on Legal Affairs - for these amendments to be put to the vote today."
"Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"Because you were so keen to say your piece, I let you speak for half a minute longer, but I should be grateful if you could remain within your speaking time in future."
"Consumer protection has been the subject of several texts we have studied in recent months, notably the Kuhn and Roth-Behrendt reports."
"The amended directive that was presented to us yesterday also comes into this category although it includes, however, one regrettable exaggeration that I would like to highlight here."
"The Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE carried out a very productive investigation into a subject that was particularly delicate and likely to arouse highly conflicting passions."
"We have been presented with the amendments proposed as if they follow on directly from this approach."
"As a member of this Committee of Inquiry, I would like to protest against such excessive claims."
"Along with my colleagues, I have spent many months trying to ensure that measures were taken to help known victims and those yet to appear."
"No directive on protection could be invoked."
"It was therefore unthinkable to continue to ignore the damage suffered by consumers of agricultural products, whatever they may be, while all other manufactured products were covered by a directive."
"For this reason, which in itself is positive, we are being presented with an extension of the directive that is totally unenforceable and unrealistic."
"How can we restore the confidence of consumers if we propose, by way of protection, judicial procedures that will probably never reach a conclusion?"
"How can we apply in practice the obligation on the producer to prove that he is not responsible for the damage reported by the consumer?"
"With all due respect to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, it is not a matter of good consumers who are the injured parties on the one hand, and bad farmers who are thus the guilty parties on the other."
"The circumstances surrounding the BSE crisis are difficult enough without making these kinds of categorisations."
"The same is true when it comes to abolishing any time limit for establishing the liability of producers."
"This is also totally inadmissible."
"Accepting such amendments opens the door to all kinds of excessive proposals and, in particular, to budgetary increases that are impossible to estimate."
"I will therefore vote against all the amendments proposed by the Roth-Behrendt report."
"Although they are based on a fair view of the situation of consumers of agricultural products, the solutions proposed are out of all proportion and require a great deal more thought and consultation with all the sectors involved."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report on product liability."
"The original directive on product liability from 1985 contained a derogation for agricultural products."
"Since then, all the Member States have extended the directive to include agricultural products and game as well, with the exception of Portugal, Spain and Germany."
"However, the mad cow affair has led the Commission to remove this derogation."
"That is the background to the revision of the directive."
"The report also contains some quite controversial amendments aimed at extending consumer protection further than the Commission's original proposal."
"The only point which the Danish Social Democrats are unable to support is the proposal to remove the scope for Member States to introduce thresholds or limits for liability."
"The principle must always be that the rules - whether national or European - which protect consumers best must be applied."
"The June Movement has voted in favour of the proposals from the Environment Committee on consumer protection in the area of product liability."
"Only in this way can the Member States take a decision on the matter in the Council of Ministers."
"However, we do not wish to hide the fact that we have deep concerns about the procedure which has been adopted."
"The June Movement does not want the right of initiative to be transferred from the Commission to the EU's Parliament, but instead to see it residing with the national parliaments."
"The House today gave its opinion on the amendment of the 1985 directive on liability for defective products."
"This is an extremely important text that establishes a Community system of no-fault liability, and simply putting a product onto the market is sufficient to warrant inclusion here."
"At Parliament's request, following the crisis concerning mad cow disease, the Commission proposes to include agricultural products in the scope of the directive."
"This will allow us, in applying this system of liability, to get round the problems of defining processed products and primary products that, unfortunately, have too often been encountered by judges up until now."
"It represents a significant step forward for consumer protection."
"The rapporteur did not stop there, however, and by playing on the emotional aspect of the BSE crisis, has put forward proposals that are totally excessive and unrealistic."
"They are excessive in that we cannot simply change the rules on no-fault liability without having first carried out an impact study on all the sectors involved and on the level of consumer protection."
"They are unrealistic in that, with the best will in the world, the rapporteur's proposals would not, in fact, have increased the level of protection. Instead, they would have complicated the work of judges."
"For example, how would they interpret the concept of 'possible causal relationship' advocated by the rapporteur? In addition, they would burden producers - particularly SMEs and SMIs - with insurance costs that would be passed on to the final consumer in the purchase price."
"Parliament is wise to have rejected the six most extravagant amendments proposed by the rapporteur, who prided herself in having reached an acceptable compromise."
"But with whom?"
"There was never any compromise, for our group, the PPE, had a clear position: none of the amendments that were proposed and put to the vote deserved to be adopted."
"There were two reasons for this."
"The first is that it is never a good thing to increase the amount of legislation we have and the amendments adopted today will only serve to hold up the implementation of the Commission's proposal on agricultural products."
"Secondly, Commissioner Monti yesterday promised to forward to Parliament, in January 2000, his Green Paper on the application of the directive and, in particular, its application in the agricultural sector."
"This Green Paper will be the result of broad consultation with all the sectors involved - producers, consumers, insurance companies, and so on - and is an essential stage in the work involved in any proposal to amend such an important directive."
"This report deals with the restructuring of the European Union's cultural activities and in particular the creation of a single financing instrument."
"It does not tackle a crucial issue that is undermining cultural life in Europe, namely the monopolisation of culture by a small oligarchy, a clique that is really quite powerful because it tends to take a significant proportion of public funding for itself."
"The great art historian Ernst Gombrich believes that the politicisation of art is not peculiar to totalitarian regimes but is also seen in western regimes."
"He notes the way in which access to commercial channels is denied to artists who do not conform to the dictates of fashion, to cosmopolitan, non-classical art that breaks with tradition."
"As a result of this, funding goes to the type of art reserved for a small oligarchy that is cut off from what people want."
"In addition, the public sector plays a much more important role than sponsors, resulting in the loss of the necessary cultural diversity."
"The European Union should not be indifferent to this state of affairs as it means that artists who belong to subsidised groups living in the pockets of the cultural authorities tend to have a monopoly on artistic production and dissemination."
"This leads to the creation of an official art, one that is admittedly diverse but unfairly and undemocratically excludes many artists, in particular those involved in classicism."
"It is regrettable that this problem is not tackled, particularly in this report on the 'Culture 2000' programme."
"I would like to thank Mrs Mouskouri for the excellent report she has presented today."
"In fact, while the European Commission's approach to this new generation of programmes in the field of culture is commendable in being both transparent and effective, the way in which it intends to implement them needed to be revised, and it is this that Mrs Mouskouri has undertaken so successfully."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media could not understand how the Commission could forget to include in its objectives the ordinary person's involvement in and access to cultural activities and, when it comes to implementation, forget to provide greater support for the source of richness in European society, namely the 'small' projects that involve people directly."
"The Commission placed too much importance on the large, established networks, which would in any case have no difficulty in responding to an invitation to tender, nor would they have any difficulty in finding the necessary partners, even in six other Member States!"
"It also placed too much importance on large-scale projects and events, which require a high degree of mobilisation that small associations cannot provide."
"I will therefore be voting in favour of Mrs Mouskouri's report, because she has managed to redress the balance in favour of ordinary people, the small groups that take on projects, while giving a more complete view of the socio-cultural activities that can be awarded funding and are therefore indicative of the evolution of our society."
"These include plastic, applied and visual arts (visual arts and multimedia), music and other (existing and future) forms of artistic expression."
"I appeal to the Commission to review its position and to accept our rapporteur's view, which I hope will also be that of the European Parliament as a whole."
"We all recognise that culture must be a cornerstone of the unification of Europe that we aspire to."
"To build an integrated Europe, we must exploit and promote a European cultural area, which will only fully meet the objectives of European cohesion if all Europeans feel that they are fully involved in it."
"The great advantage of the 'Culture 2000' framework programme, as amended by the rapporteur, lies in the fact that it accepts this point of view and as a result envisages a new approach to cultural activity."
"It opens up cultural activities to initiatives by and the active involvement of the Union's citizens and recognises culture explicitly as a source of jobs and a factor in social integration and citizenship."
"Another important advantage of this amended framework programme is that aims to ensure that the budgets allocated are used with optimum efficiency by resisting the tendency to spread funding too thinly and recommending a sectoral approach which encourages synergies between the various artistic fields and new forms of expression, and between these and other Community programmes."
"Looking at the prospects in store, I am delighted with the eminently democratic nature of the amended framework programme and also with the excellent work done by the rapporteur, who has taken the broad areas of cultural cooperation previously opened up by the Commission and used them to best advantage."
"It goes without saying that I support fully the draft legislative resolution proposed here."
"I fully support Nana Mouskouri in her call for more money for 'Cultural Programmes'."
"With the welcome move towards greater EU integration and particularly in the context of enlargement, Europe's rich cultural diversity is its greatest resource in protecting the identity and individuality of each Member State."
"From an economic perspective its potential has not been fully recognised or exploited."
"There can be no doubting the significance of its role in the new and expanding area of cultural and rural tourism."
"No other EU programme puts people and their cultural roots and traditions in their proper perspective."
"Coming as I do from Ireland, we are particularly proud of our rich and diverse cultural tradition."
"It is important for Europe that it is protected and promoted for future generations."
"I am reminded of the words of Gandhi: 'We did not inherit this world from our forefathers - rather, we have borrowed it from our children'."
"In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to seriously examine the role of Local Authorities in promoting cultural programmes."
"In Ireland we have set a good example through the employment of Arts Officers and I believe their role should be strengthened if we are to succeed in bringing the richness of our cultural resource to all the people."
"Culture should not be the preserve of the élite ."
"By voting in favour of Mrs Mouskouri's report on the 'Culture 2000' programme, the ARE Group wished to lend its support to this Commission proposal establishing a single political instrument for cultural activity and cooperation."
"In fact, Culture 2000 is a very real step forward which could strengthen the role of culture in the construction of Europe and provide it with an efficient and coherent means of intervention."
"We in the ARE Group have not voted in favour of the amendments to the annex to the proposal because we felt that splitting up the funding allocated and restructuring by artistic discipline would be tantamount to spreading the funding too thinly, which was what happened previously."
"Nevertheless, as implementation of this ambitious and promising project would require significant funding, the ARE Group supports the rapporteur's proposal to increase the finance to ECU 250 million."
"The report by Mrs Mouskouri on the introduction of a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation is another attempt to put some flesh on the idea of 'EU culture' - a culture which does not exist and which we do not think is desirable."
"The report stresses that the most important aim of this cooperation is to ensure that the cultural dimension assumes centre stage and acts as a driving force for European integration, and that culture is a means of integrating peoples and societies."
"Moreover, in prioritising the selection criteria, the greatest weight is given to so-called 'European added value'."
"Culture cannot be artificially created through political measures."
"Local, national and regional culture is flourishing and has done for many centuries, and we want this to continue by letting it sow its seeds among those groups which feel a sense of common culture."
"We think it is utopian to believe that an EU culture or a European cultural heritage can be invented."
"It would be quite appropriate to make proper use of the subsidiarity principle, namely by giving local, regional and national cultures the scope to develop, and not by establishing a cultural policy in the EU."
"On the basis of these considerations, we have voted against the report."
"Mrs Mouskouri's report has the merit of having found an acceptable way to bring together two lines of thinking on culture."
"The Council of Ministers and the Commission, in presenting a framework programme establishing a single financing and programming instrument, have made culture and cultural activities into an instrument for structuring European policy and identity."
"The appropriations are less thinly spread and concentrated on major European events or in-depth activities involving a greater number of European partners (six or seven) than is currently the case (usually three)."
"Many Members consider that this cultural cooperation risks giving priority to existing major cultural networks and distancing cultural activity from the citizen."
"They therefore prefer a more sectoral approach with the promotion and exploitation of activities that are more directly targeted towards small projects."
"The debate has been fascinating."
"Mrs Mouskouri's report provides a compromise for the period in question, 2000-2004."
"There is no doubt that the debate will continue and that the various points of view will change in accordance with the phases of European construction and with everyone's determination to create what is truly a European Community."
"This report deals mainly with supranational measures that aim to strengthen our common European cultural identity through a common cultural policy that will act as the driving force of the process of cultural integration."
"The measures proposed, for example to resolve the problems arising from the existence of disparities between Member States in the fiscal and labour market areas, would be appropriate if we wished to have a supranational cultural identity, but in my view this is the wrong approach."
"Instead I would prefer to see an international cultural policy."
"Furthermore, we should think about how much importance we really attach to safeguarding our European cultural identity."
"Historically, it is very difficult to find anything that could be called a 'common European cultural identity'."
"Today, cultural groups more often span different countries or continents."
"For example, a young person in Stockholm has more in common with young people from the same social group and with a similar lifestyle in New York, Paris or Barcelona, than with a 'pan-European youth' group."
"In order to discourage xenophobia and misunderstanding between people from different parts of the world and to foster solidarity and brotherhood, we should be striving to promote an understanding that cuts across today's cultural boundaries instead of constructing an artificial culture."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Waddington, for her careful report, which deals with a matter of considerable importance for the European Union."
"Mrs Waddington has shown great commitment in an area that we regard as very important for the future development of the 'Leonardo da Vinci' programme."
"Above all, we should like to stress the following points: non-discrimination in the realisation of projects under the programme, the importance of the role of non-governmental organisations, and the promotion of quality and innovation in vocational training."
"We have voted against Mrs Waddington's report today on the establishment of the second phase of the Community vocational training action programme 'Leonardo da Vinci'."
"We are in favour of people being able to participate in exchanges as part of their training, whether this is vocational or at university level."
"It can be a breath of fresh air compared with the everyday grind."
"However, we are strongly opposed to the political overtones and undertones which are expressed in the report, for example the emphasis it puts on the European dimension in the theory and practice of vocational training."
"It is also advocated that the Leonardo da Vinci programme should be seen in connection with a European employment strategy."
"We believe that unemployment should be tackled locally, regionally or nationally, since there are many different reasons why people lose their jobs."
"The strategies for combating unemployment must therefore also reflect this diversity."
"Susan Waddington's report includes several proposals which will improve vocational training and its impact on employment."
"Many of our reports dealing with unemployment stress the need for good quality training, which is absolutely essential if workers and people in general are to be made employable."
"It is therefore clear that priority must be given in this Community programme to those who are threatened by exclusion."
"This effort must be sustained and continuous, and I share the Commission's opinion about extending the programme to six years."
"Although this aim is entirely consistent with the European Social Fund, we must bring the schedules into line in order to increase coherence and efficiency."
"Similarly, we must ensure that sufficient finance is provided for the proper functioning of the programme."
"Another welcome point is the desire to involve the social partners in the implementation of Leonardo."
"This concern for transparency is a credit to Parliament and illustrates a strong determination that has already been highlighted by other texts from the House."
"In conclusion, I would like to express a reservation about the possibility of using Leonardo to support existing measures, particularly relating to the mobility of students and teachers."
"While the intention is good, does this not risk overburdening the system?"
"Rather than trying to do this, I would prefer to increase the funds allocated to the Socrates programme."
"First of all, I should like to establish that this programme of activities is of fundamental importance."
"In the main, I am able to give the report my unqualified support."
"However, I am unhappy about the fact that the internal investigation which is currently being carried out into the 'Leonardo da Vinci' programme, and which will soon be completed, is not available now when Parliament is deciding on the next phase."
"Obvious problems have come to light in the management and monitoring of the programme, which is a cause for serious comment."
"I believe that Parliament should postpone consideration of this report until the results of the internal investigation of the first phase of the 'Leonardo da Vinci' programme are clear and have been evaluated."
"We have voted against Mrs Pack's report today on the establishment of the second phase of the Community action programme in the field of education 'Socrates'."
"We are in favour of people being able to participate in exchanges as part of their training, whether this is vocational or at university level."
"It can be a breath of fresh air compared with the everyday grind."
"However, we are strongly opposed to the political overtones and undertones which are expressed in the report, for example inter-school plans, educational projects with a European dimension, European modules and the setting-up of European knowledge centres."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Pack on the clarity of her report and the fairness of the proposals she has made to improve the Socrates programme."
"This Community programme for schools and students is one of the great successes of the European Union."
"It has allowed thousands of students to perfect their education by including the European citizenship dimension."
"There is no doubt, however, that we have to improve the existing system, particularly in terms of the administration of the programme."
"Priority must of course be given to increasing the funding allocated for Socrates to allow more people to take part and also, perhaps more importantly, to increase the amount awarded to each student."
"As the report explains, the cost of this mobility is significantly higher than the grant awarded."
"I am regularly contacted by students involved in the scheme asking whether they could not be given extra funds to allow them a decent standard of living in the country in question."
"So I think we have to enhance the mobility grant significantly and take into account the discrepancies that exist in the standards of living in the Union."
"This would allow us to make this programme accessible to many more students who are sometimes worried by the extra cost involved in living abroad."
"I agree with the proposal to widen the scope of the Socrates programme to include adults who have left the education system without qualifications."
"This measure is very much in line with the fight against unemployment and the ideas put forward by the Luxembourg Employment Summit."
"I agree with the rapporteur that, despite obstacles such as insufficient financial resources and disjointed structure and functioning, the first phase of the Community action programme in the field of education, Socrates, has been a success that has played a major role in increasing a common sense of belonging within the Union."
"In a world where it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate education from training and initial training from continuing training, the integrated approach of all the programmes in the field of education, vocational training and youth is most certainly the main innovation and merit of the Socrates II programme."
"Of course, there is room for improvement."
"It could be made more effective and more relevant, for example."
"A better match between the declared objectives and the methods to be used to achieve them, and a more precise definition of the tasks required of the Commission, would both help to make Socrates II even more successful."
"Nevertheless, I strongly believe that the development of a European education that transcends national borders and offers new prospects and new horizons to the European citizens of the future, is one of the key ways in which we can unify the European Union and, further, the European continent into a peaceful and prosperous whole."
"Economic and monetary union alone cannot ensure the success of such an ambitious undertaking."
"Union will be achieved just as much, and probably with greater certainty, in people's minds and in the discovery by the younger generations that they all belong to a common project that is still open to the world."
"This is the fundamental issue underlying the Socrates II programme, and I subscribe to it totally."
"For this reason I lend my unequivocal support to Parliament's opinion on the subject today."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for her invaluable report."
"Opening access to the 'Socrates' programme has important implications for European educational programmes in the future."
"In our explanation of vote, we should like to express our views on opening the programme to include Turkey."
"We regard this move as controversial because of the continuing instances of human rights abuse in that country."
"However, it should be noted that Amendment No 22 not only deals with Turkey's participation in the programme, but also with that of EEA and EFTA countries."
"The European Parliament should, as a matter of urgency, give its opinion on whether Norway and Iceland, for example, are to be included in the programme."
"As regards Turkey, the views expressed above also apply to the action programme for youth."
"In view of the fact that, despite having signed the European Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago, Turkey is still not complying with the principles it enshrines, I cannot support the proposal to include that country in the programme of actions outlined in this report."
"There are two points I would like to make about the new version of the Socrates programme."
"The new Grundtvig programme includes parents' associations as equal partners in adult education for the first time."
"As the initiator of various European parents' projects, I welcome this wholeheartedly."
"Our education programmes have a common goal: to develop a generation of young Europeans to whom we can entrust the future of Europe."
"Parents have a considerable role to play here, and their cooperation at European level, their cooperation with teachers and their own continuing education are all important issues."
"I also welcome the fact that the new Socrates proposal creates a legal basis which also allows Turkey to participate in the programme, and I hope that this can be put into practice in the near future."
"I regard Turkey's involvement as an opportunity to develop awareness of human rights and democracy among the Turkish people, and it was on this same basis that I produced my own report calling for Turkey to be included in the current Socrates programme."
"The decision taken on the basis of this present report will enable us to start preparing Turkey for participation in the programme, and I feel sure that the European Parliament will now back this report."
"In Denmark there is a good and long tradition of performing voluntary work in all age groups, and not just among young people, even if the level of activity is considerably higher in that section of the population."
"Denmark is often referred to as 'the country of organisations', and on average every Danish person belongs to an organisation of one kind or another, whether it be a political party, a youth organisation, a scouting movement or a residents' association."
"All these people are working to improve the situation of their members and of others who sympathise with their cause."
"However, there are few of them who wish to work to develop the European dimension, to promote awareness of true European citizenship and to promote a European educational area."
"We would also query whether there is such a thing as a 'European dimension' at all."
"We are strongly opposed to the political overtones and undertones which are expressed in the report."
"On the basis of these considerations, we have voted against Mr De Coene's report."
"I must congratulate Philippe De Coene on the excellent work he has done, not only because I agree with his analysis, but also because it has probably given certain Commission services and in particular the Member States something to think about."
"I have always thought that, in order to improve a situation, it is necessary to take a new look at accepted ideas and not to stop at the first hurdle."
"This is what the rapporteur is suggesting today."
"In terms of content, it seems to me that the idea of striking a balance between the various actions within the youth programme is a very positive one."
"Young people, by their very nature and mentality, are thirsty for mobility, knowledge, experience, involvement; in a word, what they need is citizenship."
"So reintroducing exchanges among the young and giving them the necessary funding is a very good thing."
"In this respect, the recent demonstrations by French secondary school students support the rapporteur's arguments."
"In addition, I also believe that the EVS, which I support wholeheartedly and which is very much a credit to the Commissioner and her services, can be improved upon, for example by adopting Philippe De Coene's idea of providing a more precise definition of what the host organisations (non-profit-making organisations) and host projects (activities which cannot replace jobs) should involve."
"It is better to be clear about this from the beginning so as to avoid any misunderstandings."
"What we want is to be more accessible to young people and to provide them with better information to get them more involved, which will in turn help them to take part in a Europe which is created by them and for them."
"That is why I will be voting in favour of this report."
"In many respects, it is a good idea to group the various programmes together."
"Most of the objectives are also praiseworthy, for example the learning of languages and the mobility of young people to increase their knowledge about new and unfamiliar cultures."
"However, I am unable to support those amendments which contain the objectives of promoting a 'true European citizenship', 'the European Union's principles and rules' and 'the participation of young people in the development of the Union'."
"I do not believe that these objectives are compatible with a programme for young people."
"In my view, we should be broadening our global and international perspective, which is very different from the narrow concept of an EU identity that is a constantly recurring theme, even though no one supports it."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam and indeed Agenda 2000 firmly place the whole of cultural policy, research, innovation, education and training policy, in short, knowledge policy, at the centre of the future evolution of the Union."
"What matters today is to provide the widest possible access to education and continuous updating of knowledge."
"Presenting its three proposals for decisions on education, training and youth, the Commission sets out guidelines for Community action designed to contribute to the construction of a European area of culture and education."
"In our view it is important to have synergy between these three proposals which must inevitably contribute to the development of knowledge, the enrichment of citizenship and the improvement of employment chances, through acquisition of the specific skills that have become necessary today."
"In a rapidly evolving world, driven by technological change and the advance of the information society, the artificial division of education and training must steadily be reduced, and this is our priority task: to draw up legislation which upholds the cultural policy of the Union at all levels."
"In our opinion the traditional distinction between initial training and continuous training or, indeed, the distinction between formal and informal education, also needs to be broken down by simplifying bureaucratic procedures and creating close and continuous links between the Community and national spheres by means of the Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund. Cooperation measures in the field of youth constitute a crucial keystone in the active integration of young people and the promotion of citizenship of Europe."
"The Danish Social Democrats in Parliament have today voted in favour of extending and improving the three programmes based on the guidelines in Agenda 2000."
"The programmes are being simplified and the equal treatment aspects strengthened, both in terms of equal treatment for men and women and the inclusion of marginalised groups."
"On the whole, we also support the proposed changes to the programmes."
"However, there are some wordings which we feel go too far in terms of emphasising the supranational element."
"In our view, the Member States should continue to have the main competence in the education sector."
"European education policy should only supplement and support the national policy on education."
"The Waddington, Pack, De Coene and Castagnetti reports on work-linked training and apprenticeship, life-long learning, transnational education, guest teachers and so on contain a number of fine proposals."
"The programmes are strongly geared towards 'European identity', 'European cultural heritage' and 'EUROPASS Training', all of which are designed to carry us inexorably towards European integration."
"Most of the programmes involve the allocation of fresh funding."
"In this respect, the current investigation into the 'Leonardo da Vinci' programme concerns the misappropriation of EU funds."
"The impartial nature of the report is to be commended, but the recurring theme of a 'European' superstructure is not supported by the people themselves."
"The questions we should be asking are: what is meant by a European culture, and is there really any such thing?"
"The second phase of the Socrates and Leonardo programmes calls for imagination and innovation in the field of vocational training for young people and adults and lifelong learning."
"As the aim of 'equal opportunities for men and women' is also strongly emphasised, would it not be judicious and just to propose training courses especially for young women?"
"Nowadays many women postpone having their first child in order to ensure they obtain occupational qualifications at all costs (in Europe the average age at which women have their first child is 29) or they break off their university education or vocational training as soon as they have children."
"Reconciling motherhood and training would be both possible and highly desirable, and would benefit women, couples, children and therefore social cohesion."
"Should we not therefore encourage healthy competition in this area between the various countries of Europe?"
"As for the Community action programme for youth, it lacks character, inspiration and cultural perspective."
"There are already other programmes for young people in the areas of school exchanges, vocational training and apprenticeships, so we would have liked this new programme to put forward ideas on ways to help the young people of our various countries to become more familiar with what they have in common in their cultural heritage, something which they are no longer brought up on."
"Sadly, throughout Europe, literary education, knowledge of Greek and Roman antiquity, ten centuries of history and civilisation incorrectly referred to as the Middle Ages - in short, culture in general - have been replaced by disciplines which do not aim to impart knowledge of the human condition."
"All the great ages in history and in the civilisation of our various peoples have had a European dimension: the Roman Empire, Charlemagne's Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, monarchism, chivalry, Romanesque art, Gothic art, universities, pilgrimages, the Renaissance, classicism, the Enlightenment, and so on."
"Would a lack of humanism, at the end of the century and the millennium, not be the greatest deficit in Europe, even though, according to Paul Valéry, Europe is the continent that has most questioned the role of man in nature, in society and in the face of God."
"Yes, if we wished, Europe's young people could indeed discover renewed enthusiasm for their common destiny."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his diligence in carrying out this important task."
"The creation of a mechanism whereby the Commission can intervene to remove certain obstacles to trade had previously been dealt with in an unsatisfactory manner by the Commission, particularly with respect to the rights of trade unions and the right of Member States to govern their own affairs."
"Nevertheless, the problem needs to be resolved promptly and, in our opinion, this report deals satisfactorily with the question of trade union rights and the right of Member States to govern their own affairs."
"The proposal for a Council Regulation presented to us today aims to create a mechanism whereby the Commission can intervene to require the Member States to remove certain internal obstacles to trade."
"The Commission had this idea following the farmers' demonstrations in France in 1993 and 1995, during which imported products - in particular, lorry- loads of Spanish strawberries - were intercepted and destroyed by farmers."
"In certain cases the French government considered it better not to send in the forces of law and order so as to avoid more serious disruption, an attitude which outraged Brussels."
"Hence the current draft text, which aims to provide the Commission with instruments to ensure greater respect for the free movement of goods, which, as we are told ad nauseam in the explanatory statement and in the recitals, is one of the fundamental principles of the European Community, though it is not pointed out that it is not the only one and that it is in fact less fundamental than others."
"The Commission proposal shows the outrageously undemocratic way in which the European institutions often behave in order to promote supranationality."
"It also leads us to consider the responsibility of the Member States in the area of public order, which is also topical in the context of the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Firstly, I would like to comment on the undemocratic methods."
"The first version of the draft simply provided for the Commission to have the right to take 'decisions' condemning the action (or inaction) of certain Member States with regard to obstacles to trade."
"These decisions were to serve as a basis for court judgments, at both national and Community level, imposing fines or penalty payments on the Member States."
"The Council was amazed at the enormity of the proposal: Commission officials, without batting an eyelid - although for them it was a natural thing to do - were asking the Council to grant them the power to impose sanctions on the Member States."
"Even if it had wished to do so, the Council would not have been able to delegate this power, quite simply because it does not possess it, except in the case of the excessive deficit procedure."
"The officials invoked the conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council on the action plan for the single market, in which the Heads of State or Government requested that the Commission 'examine ways and means of guaranteeing in an effective manner the free movement of goods, including the possibility of imposing sanctions on the Member States'."
"On this occasion, the Council discovered that at the Amsterdam European Council the Heads of State or Government were made to say all sorts of things in the Final Act without being aware of what was happening."
"We actually hope that we were instrumental in revealing this manipulation, since we denounced it vigorously at the time."
"So the Council revised the Commission proposal, but only half-heartedly, so that the second version of the text, which is presented to us today, is little better than the first."
"In it, the notion of Commission 'decision' is in fact replaced by that of 'notification', which is deliberately ambiguous, with the result that it is difficult to say whether it is optional, like an opinion, or binding, like a decision."
"The problem is exacerbated by the total absence of a legal basis, so that the Commission has been obliged to resort to the ever-useful Article 235, which we have condemned a hundred times because it allows the Community to grant itself powers which the Treaties deny it."
"For all of these reasons the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes it is very much justified in voting against the draft regulation."
"However, this case also leads us to consider the wider issue of the principle that the Member States have primary responsibility for internal public order."
"Although this basic rule is recognised by the Treaty in several places, for example in Article 36 on the movement of goods, it is constantly flouted, including by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"In fact, in what is now an old case (Rutili judgment, 28 October 1975), the Court stated that the concept of responsibility of the Member States for internal public order 'must be interpreted strictly."
"Its scope cannot be determined unilaterally by each Member State without being subject to control by the institutions of the Community', such control being itself the result of the desire to preserve the principles of Community law."
"In the case relating to the farmers' demonstrations of 1993-1995, we now have the Court of Justice's judgment of 9 December 1997, which takes the same line and bears out all the Commission's claims."
"France's arguments, which were based on national responsibility for public order, were swept aside by the Court."
"I will quote one passage of the judgment: 'the Member States, which retain exclusive competence as regards the maintenance of public order and the safeguarding of internal security, unquestionably enjoy a margin of discretion in determining what measures are most appropriate to eliminate barriers to the importation of products in a given situation."
"It is therefore not for the Community institutions to act in place of the Member States and to prescribe for them the measures which they must adopt and effectively apply in order to safeguard the free movement of goods on their territories."
"However, it falls to the Court, taking due account of the discretion referred to above, to verify, in cases brought before it, whether the Member State concerned has adopted appropriate measures for ensuring the free movement of goods.'"
"In other words, the state is responsible for its own public order, but this responsibility is restricted by Community principles which it cannot contradict; on the contrary, it must support them."
"This ruling by the Court, and the position of the European institutions in general, sheds a very interesting light on the debate on the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Supporters of this Treaty claim that abandoning personal controls at the borders with our neighbours would not cause any particular problem, nor would communitising our whole immigration policy, as Article 64 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides a safeguard clause by guaranteeing that: 'This Title shall not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.'"
"We can see what a 'safeguard' of this kind would be worth in reality."
"It is a smokescreen intended to mislead people by making them believe that their Member State retains its powers, while these powers are gradually being whittled away by the undemocratic means of the case-law of the Court of Justice."
"In this case, if France, having ratified the Amsterdam Treaty, wished one day to restore personal controls at its borders because of an increasing threat to public order, the Commission would reply that our country must find a way to maintain its internal law and order while preserving the fundamental Community principle of the free movement of persons."
"We would be required to obey this injunction under threat of being dragged before the Court of Justice, whose final decision would be known in advance."
"What the Council wishes to adopt today in the form of this draft regulation, and what some wish to have adopted in the Amsterdam Treaty, is the most appalling crime that can be committed against a people: preventing it from defending itself when attacked."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of creating an intervention mechanism in order to remove certain obstacles to trade."
"The Commission's original proposal was completely unacceptable, since it gave the Commission too great a power to intervene in technical disputes, and also because the proposal could have undermined some basic rights such as the right to strike."
"The new proposal for which we have voted is quite different."
"The Commission is no longer given the power to require a Member State to intervene in national strikes."
"The new proposal only obliges the Member States to keep the Commission informed of any obstacles to trade, and of how they intend to bring these to an end."
"A provision has also been included which guarantees the right to strike."
"We have therefore decided to back the rapporteur, who has recommended that the Commission's proposal should be supported in its present form."
"We, the undersigned, voted against the report for the following reasons:"
"the decision could lead to violations of the fundamental rights of trade unions; -it is legislatively inadmissible to combine provisions on the free movement of goods and those on the free movement of persons; -the Commission should not be given the kind of authority that is proposed, which should be reserved for the Court of Justice or negotiations on the substance of the Treaties."
"The Commission should not be entitled to act in cases that involve distinctions between national and EU rights."
"The non-attached Members cannot agree with Amendments Nos 1 to 15."
"Although what they say is correct, it does not appear appropriate to link our justified concern about the free movement of workers with a regulation introducing a mechanism for the Commission to intervene in order to remove certain obstacles to trade."
"The issue of the free movement of workers should be the subject of its own report."
"The report has been produced with undue haste and raises additional issues at too short notice for consideration during this part-session."
"It has not been properly thought through, and although it has been toned down and is thus an improvement on the original, it is still unacceptable."
"The right to strike has been restricted, labour rights emasculated, and both national legislation and collective life disregarded."
"The report should therefore be rejected."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the Skinner report on the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) creating a mechanism whereby the Commission can intervene in order to remove certain obstacles to trade (COM(97)0619)."
"This is primarily about the free movement of goods around the Single European Market, and not the free movement of people."
"However, given its importance, the EPLP has supported a reference to the free movement of people in the recital of the report."
"The report deals with the possibility of intervention when the free movement of goods is 'obstructed by actions of private individuals'."
"The report does not, in itself, override the right to strike, but it could still have serious consequences for the work of the trade unions."
"For example, the proposal imposes far-reaching obligations on the respective countries to remove obstacles to trade, which makes it impossible for countries to remain neutral in labour market conflicts."
"Furthermore, according to the Swedish Transport Workers Union, the proposal would result in the governments of individual countries acting in a way that would facilitate strike-breaking in conflict situations."
"For this reason, I am unable to vote for the report."
"Having established the single internal market and entered the final straight for the introduction of the euro, the EU is now trying to armour-plate its policy with measures which will 'safeguard' it from the reactions of European citizens and their disputes."
"In the name of unimpeded implementation of the principle of the free movement of goods, it is trying to use the proposed regulation to undermine the most fundamental social rights."
"The argument always used, the celebrated 'obstacles to trade', is again being trotted out as an excuse to stifle European citizens' democratic, social and personal rights."
"Under the first proposal, which represented the prevailing view in the Commission - the predominant 'federal' body of the EU with extensive executive powers - private citizens were given the right, following a decision by the Commission, to go to the national courts and to ask for the adoption of temporary measures, the award of compensation and the imposition of fines."
"At the same time, and in order to 'prevent the spread of disturbances', the Member State on whose territory disputes are taking place is transformed into a policing executive body with responsibility for adopting the 'necessary' suppressive measures to 'remove obstacles, failing which it risks the Damoclean sword of being taken before the European Court of Justice."
"Working people will be attacked on two fronts: by the national authorities and by 'private individuals who would be affected'."
"The political agreement achieved by the Council brought some improvement to the initial text since the individual's right of recourse to legal proceedings is eliminated in favour of a decision by the Commission and recourse to insurance."
"However, the legal and political pressures on the Member State involved remain in place."
"Despite the changes made, the proposed regulation we are considering potentially unleashes a storm and threatens to become a decisive blow against the exercise of collective labour rights."
"The right to strike and the right to hold meetings are flagrantly undermined and a new period of restrictive application of those rights is being officially inaugurated."
"It is clear that the Europe of monopolies and bankers cannot withstand the claims of Greek, French and Italian farmers who are fighting to mitigate the consequences of the anti-agricultural policies pursued by the EU and the Member States, with demonstrations by lorry-drivers demanding reasonable working hours and the abolition of dumping."
"The Europe of 'free movement' cannot withstand action by ships' crews fighting to prevent their labour rights from being reduced to third-world levels."
"Yet again, hypocrisy is exceeding all bounds."
"On the one hand, lip-service is paid to the celebrated subsidiarity, bombastic declarations are made, the fundamental rights of individuals are invoked, and at the same time the Member States are transformed into brutal suppressors of the struggles of the labour movement."
"Clearly, the division of responsibilities that results from subsidiarity assigns the role of strike-breaker to the Member States."
"There is also justified concern about the part to be played by the Schengen Information System in this context, since there is a danger that anyone actively involved in industrial action will be entered on lists of those 'suspected' of being responsible for public disorder."
"The step to bring back the concept of 'the enemy within' is not far off and is facilitated by the deliberately vague definition of 'the suppression of terrorism', which seems to have been upgraded to one of Europol's main areas of activity."
"We will vote against the report in the most categorical way."
"It is an issue where there is no room for amendments or corrections."
"But on that point, it is not by chance that some amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which attempt to introduce some kind of safety valve in relation to the right to hold meetings and concern for legitimacy, from a legal point of view and exclusively in the context of national labour legislation, have not been included in the report."
"For our part, we call upon working people in Europe to continue their struggle to overthrow such orders and fight to safeguard and extend their rights."
"We will stand by them."
"I am happy to vote for this Report by my Labour Party colleague Peter Skinner."
"After the French lorry driver strikes of recent years which have caused so much damage to other countries' innocent companies and self employed drivers, this report makes sound suggestions for limiting such problems in the future."
"I back the call for a rapid restoration of the free movement of goods in cases where they are impeded so as to seriously disrupt the working of the internal market."
"There is a difficult balance to reach between the competing demands of union rights to protest peacefully in their own country on the one hand, and the need to allow trade to continue in the internal market all our governments have long been committed to."
"Domestic disputes such as the recent blockades of ports in France should be settled by the parties to those disputes in the country concerned."
"The rest of us should be able to go about our business."
"An early warning system of possible obstacles to free trade between the governments and the Commission should help."
"Governments should be required to ensure that foreign citizens and companies are able to carry on their legitimate business where a local dispute has nothing to do with them."
"I hope that the balanced approach of this report will allow for both legitimate disputes to be settled in any EU country as well as for the rest of the EU to be allowed to trade freely and fairly."
"Mr President, I am speaking in this explanation of vote because I wish my vote on Mr Chanterie's report to be recorded in the Minutes."
"I voted differently from the rest of my Group and am very proud of having done so, particularly as regards paragraph 7."
"I welcome the adoption of this text and I believe that, pending the implementation by the European Union of the complete harmonisation measures which we recommended, Parliament was right to call by such a large majority for Article 6(1) of the existing directive to be modified 'in such a way as to create an unmistakable obligation on the part of Member States actually torecognise registrations carried out, or authorisations granted, by other Member States' in the field of homeopathic medicine."
"I believe that my Group was wrong to vote against this recommendation."
"For this reason I have voted with the majority of the House, and I wanted to make this statement in order to ensure that it is recorded in the Minutes."
"I am extremely pleased with this vote on the Chanterie report, which is very important for the future of homeopathic medicine."
"We cannot help but notice that, six years after the adoption of the two 1992 Directives adding additional provisions to the 1965, 1975 and 1981 Directives relating to homeopathic medicinal products, there is still distortion of competition and an imbalance in the market in this sector."
"Furthermore, four Member States have been brought before the Court of Justice by the Commission on the grounds of failure to transpose the two directives or to transpose them in full into national law."
"Yet more than one in five Europeans now uses homeopathy!"
"Things have definitely dragged on too long."
"It is particularly important to respond quickly to this situation as the manufacturers of homeopathic medicines are generally small and medium-sized enterprises that suffer from the continuing obligation to register their products separately in each of the Member States."
"For this reason I support the rapporteur's proposal to modify Community legislation in such a way as to create an obligation on the part of Member States actually to recognise - under specific conditions yet to be determined - registrations carried out, or authorisations granted, by other Member States."
"Such changes to the legislation currently in force presuppose of course that all Member States meet the highest health and safety standards with regard to national authorisations and registrations of homeopathic medicinal products."
"The effective liberalisation of the market in these products must not result in a lower standard of health protection for the population of any Member State."
"Interest in homeopathic medicinal products is increasing."
"It is important for consumers that homeopathic remedies are recognised as medicines."
"A decision needs to be taken so that they can feel confident in what they are buying."
"People should be able to buy and use homeopathic medicinal products in the knowledge that they will not harm their health."
"Consumers would like to see clearer and better product descriptions on the products they use, which would be encouraged by greater mutual recognition in the field of homeopathy."
"At the same time, there are various reasons why national legislation in this area differs between Member States and, in this respect, a lack of coordination is apparent in the present directive."
"For there to be mutual recognition, each Member State should know about the registration requirements in other countries."
"Those requirements and the reasons for them should be made known in order to facilitate comparisons."
"Each country would then have to decide whether it was going to recognise another country's homeopathic products."
"In the meantime, there is no reason why Member States should be compelled to recognise products which have been authorized in another country."
"In this report it is stated, amongst other things, that the compulsory mention of 'homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indication' on the label of homeopathic products has pejorative overtones which have a discriminatory effect."
"It therefore proposes that this should be changed to: 'application in accordance with clinical homeopathic pharmacology'."
"Furthermore, Member States would be obliged to recognise homeopathic remedies which had been authorised in other Member States, and also to agree to the lifting of the ban on fantasy names for homeopathic medicinal products."
"I think that these measures will have adverse consequences."
"The sale of homeopathic medicinal products is quite strictly regulated as regards names and warnings, for example, so that consumers will not be duped into believing that a particular preparation will cure serious illness."
"In countries with high charges for hospital visits, people may be inveigled into taking pills that make them feel better, instead of being examined by a doctor and having the right medicine prescribed."
"In this context, the name of the preparation is of considerable psychological importance."
"Homeopathic medicinal products are good when taken in conjunction with traditional medical treatment, but we should not allow ourselves to end up in a situation where people use homeopathic remedies instead of going to the doctor."
"I was very happy to support Mrs Thyssen's report."
"It was quite right to stress the value of a good outside assessment of the Commission's activities."
"The Commission's wide-ranging report all too often fails to say clearly exactly what results have been achieved."
"In a variety of respects, the added value of Community action remains distinctly nebulous."
"The European Commission has a duty to allow the subsidiarity principle to operate freely in practice."
"If there is no added value, there is no justification for Community action."
"So you have to be sensible and draw a line under it."
"In short: the Commission should do less, but do it better."
"Paragraph 20 of the resolution makes the point that environmental policy is not sufficiently integrated into policy on SMEs."
"On the relationship between policy on SMEs and policy on the environment, the informal Environment Council held in Amsterdam in mid-April 1997 concluded that small businesses created jobs, but that they also created a significant amount of environmental pollution."
"My impression is that the Commission does not take its Treaty obligation all that seriously here, and that perhaps the environment is better off as a result."
"The environmental technology sector offers a very promising challenge in terms of both more jobs and less pressure on the environment."
"I trust the European Commission's next coordination report will be considerably more informative and insightful."
"We all recognise the dynamic role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in the vitality of modern economies and in job creation."
"The extent of the work carried out in recent years by the various European Union institutions to promote greater development of small and medium-sized enterprises is to be welcomed with good reason."
"However, we cannot help but note that a number of these enterprises continue to regard the European Union with intense mistrust."
"One of the reasons for this is that, as we have lamented on several occasions in the House, these enterprises are not involved in European social dialogue."
"A further reason for small and medium-sized enterprises' mistrust of European institutions lies in the complexity of our legislation, which often gives the impression of being mixed up with national provisions to create an impenetrable web."
"I share the rapporteur's belief that greater clarity and precision in the Commission communications on SMEs and their real powers in this area would facilitate understanding for the businessmen concerned."
"Another point highlighted by the rapporteur, and which caught my attention, was the absence of precise data on the actual involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises in Structural Fund measures."
"The absence of statistics in such an important area seems to be a contradiction given that the Structural Funds account for a third of Community expenditure and that, as I have already mentioned, we all agree on the importance of the role of SMEs in a modern economy and in job creation."
"In conclusion, I believe it is essential that we continue to look closely at possible ways of achieving synergies among the SMEs in all areas of their activities where economies of scale are possible: administration, research and development, training, market assessment, etc."
"The report contains many fine proposals."
"The one which incorporates Mr Robles Piquer's motion for a resolution on a European quality certificate for small and medium-sized enterprises, which as an additional precaution will include 'identical criteria in all Member States', contains too much regulatory detail."
"Quality certificates already exist in the different countries, to which small businesses also have access."
"I think that any attempt to introduce such a European certificate will only lead to more bureaucracy."
"That concludes voting time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 November 1998."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 5 November 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"I should like it to be explicitly recorded in the Minutes that I said in Brussels that it is not only for reasons of principle that I am no longer voting in roll-call votes - which I have not done for some time -, but also for taxation reasons."
"I repeat: Dutch taxation reasons."
"I should like this to be recorded."
"Thank you, Mr Janssen van Raay, that will be done."
"Mr President, I do not want to speak about the Minutes, but I would like to ask you when the new parliament will be completed."
"Is the IPE4, which is still a 'forbidden city', something out of a science fiction novel?"
"We are still here today in this lovely Hemicycle, which we are, of course, attached to, since we cannot sit in the new building."
"We hear rumours here and we wait."
"When will the inaugural sitting be held?"
"Will it be in December, February or the summer of 1999?"
"Why are there such delays?"
"We accept the argument that the complex process of moving in must be as well organised as possible, but I sincerely hope that it not a matter once again of politicking against Strasbourg."
"Mr President, we expect a clear response explaining all this wavering that damages Parliament's image of rigour, efficiency and credibility."
"What I can tell you, Mr Striby, is that the building is not yet ready for occupation."
"Clearly, the company which had the task of constructing of the building should have made it available to Parliament last January."
"Parliament is not responsible for the fact that it is still not ready, since it has not yet been certified by the relevant authorities or the architects."
"For our part, we are doing our utmost to cooperate with the city of Strasbourg and the French Government so that it can be completed as soon as possible, in accordance with the regulations which apply."
"Once this has been done, we shall carry out our share of the dataprocessing work for Parliament and inaugurate the building as soon as possible."
"However, I cannot give you a date. That is outside our control."
"Mr President, I took the liberty of writing to you last week on the situation in Central America."
"As each day passes it becomes clearer that the loss of life and physical damage experienced in that region have indeed been of biblical proportions."
"The citizens of the Member States - Spain, for instance - are making an enormous effort to express their solidarity with the people of Central America. In keeping with this effort, I suggested in my letter to you that the Members of the European Parliament should open a special account."
"Members could pay their own contributions into such an account, and also any donations made through reputable non-governmental organisations to help rebuild the area. This symbolic gesture would supplement the effort the European Community is already making to respond to the situation."
"I believe that on this occasion Members of the European Parliament should show they are on the same wavelength as the citizens and join with them in expressing solidarity with the victims."
"I wonder, Mr President, if you are now in a position to voice your response to this letter I sent you last week."
"Thank you, Mr Carnero."
"The matter was put before Parliament's Bureau, as you requested in your letter."
"The Bureau felt it was not appropriate for it - or, indeed, for Parliament - to open such an account, and that problems could well arise in connection with the Financial Regulation. However, if one or several Members were to take up your suggestion, we would publicise their initiative, drawing it to Members' attention so they could contribute if they wished."
"I am sure many of us have already made a contribution through these organisations, as have large numbers of our fellow citizens in the Member States. Nevertheless, the sort of initiative you suggest is always welcome and worthy of commendation."
"However, it must be undertaken on an individual level. It is not for a parliamentary body to launch it, though every assistance and support should of course be offered."
"Mr President, I would like to speak at this public sitting this evening in my capacity as chairman of Parliament's Delegation for relations with Japan. In the framework of the bilateral exchanges and meetings organised by the European Parliament, particularly by Parliament's sessional services, we are receiving an official visit from an important delegation of seven members of the Japanese Diet and four members of the Japanese Senate, including two former ministers, this week in Strasbourg."
"According to the agenda, there are votes being held on Thursday morning."
"But on Thursday morning we also have a meeting that is authorised by the sessional services, which was even organised by Parliament's sessional services, during the votes on Agenda 2000."
"Therefore, I find myself caught between two stools. This is not a serious problem for me personally, as I have accepted my responsibilities and have decided, as chairman of the delegation, to attend the meeting, but there is a risk that I might be there on my own."
"Short of cutting themselves in two, my colleagues are, in fact, either going to have to appear impolite towards our Japanese guests or show a lack of consistency with the decision we had taken not to plan any meetings of Parliament's official bodies during voting time."
"I am in a situation where I feel totally schizophrenic and, although I am a doctor, I am having trouble sorting myself out."
"I would like to have a response on this matter, Mr President."
"Normally there are no votes at that time on Thursday, Mr Pompidou, except in the case of those on the budget."
"This is a quite exceptional situation because of the large number of votes to be taken on Agenda 2000."
"That could not be foreseen when the time was fixed for the meeting of your delegation."
"We shall look into the matter and see what can still be done at such short notice, and I will keep you informed."
"Mr President, would you please have it recorded in the Minutes that today I found my office ransacked and full of broken glasses and a radio missing, even though I had locked the office doors after the last part-session and, interestingly enough, found them locked again today."
"Would you please also record the question I am now putting to you in the Minutes: when will we finally be able to get on with our work without fear of the kind of violent attacks that occurred in Brussels or break-ins into our offices?"
"Mr Nassauer, I hope you have informed the security services of this incident."
"I should reassure you that to date, Parliament's security services have almost always resolved such incidents successfully. I trust this will not prove to be an exception and that the culprits will be identified."
"Should it appear necessary to tighten up on security, the appropriate measures will of course be introduced."
"Thank you for informing us of the incident."
"It will be noted in the Minutes and the security services informed so that they can take appropriate action immediately."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commission when they propose to deal with the report which was commissioned by DG XIV - reference PEM/306 - concerning the physical interaction between grey seals, fishing gear and the abnormal predatory conditions of the seals in the North Atlantic, the North-West Atlantic and now penetrating into the South Atlantic."
"It is about time that the Commission had the courage to present that report and its scientific findings to Parliament so that we can deal with that particular matter."
"Predatory behaviour of seals around the Irish and Scottish coasts amounts to the total allowable catch plus one quarter."
"Something has to be done soon and we have to face up to it."
"I ask the Commission to act with haste."
"Mr Killilea, you know perfectly well that that is not the way to put a question to the Commission."
"There are several ways of putting your question."
"This is not the right time to ask it."
"You can ask it in one of the different ways provided for in the Rules."
"Mr President, I would also like to make a point concerning working conditions because for the second time my trunk has not arrived."
"Each time I put all the files I need here in the trunk and when I arrive, I find out that it is still in Brussels."
"This is very inconvenient because all my documents for work are in that trunk."
"What is happening is that my office is on a corner and it must clearly get in the way, because people put it away in the photocopying room."
"When the removal men come, they obviously forget the trunk."
"I therefore took it out of there and put a label on it to let people know that when my trunk is put away in the photocopying room, it is not taken to Strasbourg."
"I presume that the removal men saw the second part of that note saying that it is not taken to Strasbourg."
"And I still do not have my trunk!"
"We shall take that up with the department which is responsbile, Mrs Guinebertière."
"Mr President, I must first apologise for my somewhat late arrival. Unfortunately, due to the considerable difficulties involved in reaching Strasbourg by air, many Members have arrived three hours late."
"Secondly, I should like to express my group's concern over the arrest in Italy of Mr Abdullah Ocalan, who is in danger of being extradited to Turkey."
"We are all aware of the European Parliament's policy on supporting human rights, political rights in Turkey and the rights of the Kurdish people. My group believes it would be appropriate to take the necessary action to ensure that Abdullah Ocalan, who declared a unilateral cease-fire some months ago, is not extradited to Turkey from a European country."
"Mr President, as you are aware, recently I presented a report to Parliament on the banana regime."
"It was overwhelmingly supported with quite a lot of common consent within this House and was passed on to the Commission."
"We now have complaints from the United States in the guise of Chiquita, who are attacking the Commission and the proposals that the Commission finally brought forward after the original complaint from the WTO."
"As a matter of concern, would the Commission be willing to come and explain to us how they are dealing with Chiquita's complaint?"
"Mr Thomas, I just told Mr Killilea that is not the way to put questions to the Commission."
"You know the way to put questions to the Commission, so use it."
"I did follow the procedure you just outlined and put down two questions - one to the Commission and one to Council - on building costs in Strasbourg and Brussels ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"This is not the time to put questions to the committee, nor to the Council."
"You cannot have the floor."
"Since there are no further comments, the Minutes are approved."
"Order of business"
"The next item is the order of business."
"Mr President, I just wanted to make a point of order."
"I have heard that Question Time to the Council is to be deleted this week."
"I regard this both as an infringement of Rule 41(1) of the Rules of Procedure and as an infringement of the Treaty, which specifically guarantees us the right to put questions."
"The right to put questions is one of the most important, individual parliamentary rights and I believe no Conference of Presidents, not even in this House, can simply cancel that right; we have a right to a monthly Question Time to the Council."
"I and many other colleagues have tabled important questions to the Council within the deadline."
"Let me insist that we have this Question Time."
"If the Council wants to make statements, which are often merely upgraded press conferences, that is fine by me, but not in the place of Question Time, which is a key right of every Member of Parliament."
"Mr President, I have no objections to the draft agenda for Monday, but I would like to know if it is true that the Conference of Presidents has taken a decision concerning the legal basis of the Fabra Vallés report."
"Yes, Mr Dell'Alba, and the Conference of Presidents has established that Article 206 was not the appropriate legal basis for the report."
"This report will therefore be put to the vote by simple and not absolute majority, and will not entail either approval or rejection of the Commission's management."
"The Conference of Presidents instructed me to convey to the president of the sitting its wish that this should be made very clear when the vote is taken."
"However, I am grateful that you have given me the opportunity to do that now."
"Tuesday:"
"The PPE Group has asked for the Ferri report on supplementary pensions to be brought forward from Thursday and placed after the Añoveros Trias de Bes report on promoting innovation through patents."
"Is there a speaker from the PPE Group in favour of this request?"
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has the floor."
"Mr President, we made this request because the Ferri report goes very well with and the Añoveros report, I and II."
"It is a very difficult report covering very complex issues relating to pensions."
"It is better to be able to count on the largest possible presence when voting on it."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Wednesday: no changes"
"Thursday:"
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has asked for the Commission statement on the results of the Buenos Aires summit on climate change to be postponed."
"It has also requested the inclusion, after the report by Mr Wiebenga on displaced persons, of the report by Mr Lehne on airport transit arrangements which is currently entered on Friday, so that the agenda for Thursday would be as follows: from 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m., 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. we would have first voting time, and then the Wiebenga report and the Lehne report."
"Between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. there would still be the topical and urgent debate, reduced to two hours and without returning to the normal length of three hours."
"Is there a speaker in favour?"
"Mr President, let me justify my motion to postpone the Commission statement on the Buenos Aires climate conference on the grounds that I and the Members who took part in this conference on behalf of Parliament decided, after talking the matter over, that it would be more sensible to prepare carefully for this discussion in the appropriate committees; that would allow us to conclude with a motion for a resolution which was not drafted in haste, straight after hearing the outcome of the conference, but was based on careful and detailed preparation."
"I would ask the House to endorse my group's motion, so that Parliament's views can have some substance, rather than being put forward in a rush."
"Mr President, I led the Parliamentary delegation to Buenos Aires."
"I absolutely endorse the proposal that we take our time in responding to what was a very complex outcome in Buenos Aires."
"It missed failure by a very narrow margin."
"It was Mr Linkhorst's suggestion, as one of the other members of the delegation, that rather than going straight to a debate in plenary we should attempt to have a discussion in at least the three committees most clearly responsible, draft a careful resolution and come back either in December and January."
"That is certainly the opinion of Commissioner Bjerregaard, so I endorse the idea."
"Mr President, we addressed this question last week in a perfectly normal manner."
"It was handled positively at the meeting of General Secretaries and at the Conference of Presidents."
"Anybody who has looked at the media today and also over last weekend will know that it is now and not in January that the public debate is taking place."
"It is inconceivable to me that the European Parliament would not be able to make an initial political assessment of the outcome of Buenos Aires last week."
"If we wait until January to come up with a very searching, very balanced and very detailed response, we will find that nobody is listening any more."
"On the basis of the information currently available we are perfectly able to adopt a brief, well-founded political position this week while the matter is still in the news and not when it is past history."
"It is now that we must react, it is the European Union which has shouldered its responsibilities on this issue and it is this European Parliament which must now make its voice heard."
"Thank you, Mrs Aelvoet."
"I put to the vote the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists"
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Friday:"
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has requested the removal of the debate on the oral questions on BSE in Portugal."
"Mr President, I should like to express my view as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. This issue has already been discussed in committee, first in the presence of Mr Heine when the Veterinary Committee arrived at its decision and more recently, just a few days ago, when the Commissioner himself was present at our committee meeting."
"I am not aware of any further developments that would justify this request for inclusion on the agenda."
"As far as we are concerned, this would serve no useful purpose."
"Mr President, I asked for this oral question to be included in the agenda since, in my opinion, the situation in Portugal is sufficiently serious to justify that."
"After all, despite our meetings in the Committee on Agriculture, the decision on the Portuguese meat embargo was taken at an extraordinary meeting for which I did not receive - nor did some of my colleagues - the respective agenda containing the item on the statement by Dr Heine, even though the Chairman of that committee told us here that it was sent to all Members."
"Dr Heine made a last-minute appearance to announce the reasons for the embargo."
"Everyone knew that many Members of the European Parliament would be unable to attend as it was an extraordinary meeting arranged at the last minute. That is why I have asked for a debate to be held here."
"It should be made clear that this is not only an issue for the Portuguese but also relates to how the Commission acts in this kind of situation, a very serious situation for all Portuguese meat producers."
"That is why I tabled an oral question on behalf of my group."
"Thank you, Mr Rosado Fernandes."
"Do you wish to speak in favour or against, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf?"
"Mr President, I am in favour of keeping this item on the agenda, and would add that our oral question has not been included in it."
"However, we have been told that it will be included in the final version of the agenda."
"So we also have an oral question on BSE, and I am very much in favour of debating this item."
"Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"I put to the vote the request from the PSE Group."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"MED Programmes"
"The next item is the report (A4-0404/98) by Mr Fabra Vallés, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on repercussions in the case of the MED programmes."
"Mr President, the Spanish Secretary of State for Development Cooperation, Mr Fernando Villalonga, published an excellent article in the press last week entitled 'Felling the rotten tree to save the forest'. This age-old idea encapsulates the thinking behind my report."
"Through the resolution dated 31 March this year, Parliament entrusted me with its preparation, and I can assure you that it has been one of the least pleasant duties I have had to carry out in my 20 years as an elected representative."
"Clearly, it is not and never has been the intention of Parliament, its Committee on Budgetary Control, or myself as rapporteur to obstruct the policy for decentralised cooperation with Mediterranean countries."
"Such cooperation aims to strengthen direct contacts with universities, cities, local groups and journalists in those countries, enabling the peoples on both shores of the Mediterranean to become acquainted, exchange views, and understand each other better."
"Our intention has always been to preserve such important cooperation, and to strengthen and improve its foundations."
"In this context, I must remind you that it was not Parliament but the Commission - Commissioner Marín himself - that ordered such cooperation to cease at the end of 1995. In my opinion, this was entirely justified, following as it did a most critical report from the Court of Auditors, whose investigation had revealed very serious irregularities."
"Since this report became public, Parliament has done everything necessary to restore the credibility of this policy and allow it to be relaunched, from the month of April."
"I am grateful for the Commission's efforts in this regard, Mr Liikanen."
"Nevertheless, it also has to be said, Mr Liikanen, that if we really want to save the forest we have to be sure to fell all the diseased trees."
"And, before felling them, we also have to be sure that we have identified them all first."
"In this connection, I want to make it quite clear that on the basis of the documentation received and studied, it does not appear that there are grounds for bringing criminal charges against those in authority at the Commission's 'North-South' Directorate- General."
"Thanks to the information made available by Mr Marín, we know that the Commission has paid ECU 600 000 for the projects to be audited."
"You are aware of this too, as you have had the findings on your desk since September."
"On the basis of the European Commission's own criteria, experts at the London firm that carried out the audit have identified costs totalling ECU 4 million that ought to be recovered."
"They have also identified a further sum of over ECU 20 million and additional checks will have to be done in this respect, not to mention the total of ECU 2.2 million to be recovered from the technical assistance firms."
"A further and as yet unknown sum must be added to this total. The exact amount will become known when we receive details of the audit from financial control concerning the MED-LINK aid offices."
"Commissioner, I am about to conclude, but I must first call on you to show some courage, courage enough to recognise that you have been mistaken or misinformed as to the true extent of the problems and the sums concerned."
"You now have the opportunity to inform us that you are going to pass the whole file on to the judicial authorities."
"I urge you to take advantage of this opportunity, because it is not for the European Commission or for Parliament to decide whether or not punishable offences have been committed."
"That is a matter for the judicial authorities."
"It is a simple and fundamental principle that Parliament confirmed once again in its resolution on the discharge on 31 March this year."
"Furthermore, it is an obligation the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has confirmed by case-law."
"It is not only an obligation, it is a necessity, because it is a very complicated file, and many individuals are involved. Given the resources and rights it has, or rather does not have, at its disposal, UCLAF cannot successfully undertake an investigation of this magnitude without the support of the judicial authorities."
"If matters take this course, I shall be able to say that I am in favour of granting the discharge where this issue is concerned, and at the same time, you will have the chance of restoring the credibility the Commission has been losing over the last few weeks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody, including this Parliament, comes back to the same question twice without reason."
"We are not doing this to avoid boredom or because we do not know how to spend the day."
"It would have been better if we could have clarified everything that needs clarifying in a report."
"But in our view some important points were not clarified, and nor have they been in the meantime, unfortunately."
"I am emphasising this again, although Mr Fabra Vallés has already made the point."
"If we assume that only a court or the appropriate judicial authority can decide whether the facts of the case constitute grounds for criminal proceedings, then the judicial authorities must be in possession of all the information."
"But then 'all' unfortunately really does mean all, because who could make a selection?"
"The Commission's relationship with the Member States' judicial authorities is simply different from the situation that would apply within a Member State."
"A special relationship, or perhaps a too poorly defined relationship, exists between the Commission, the Commission officials, the buildings, the documents in the possession of the Commission and the other European institutions on the one hand, and the individual national judicial authorities on the other - and obviously only national judicial authorities can consider the case."
"We are aware of this difficulty, as is the rapporteur, who has taken it into account in his report."
"Nevertheless, we must urge that decisions are taken in the place where they belong, namely by the national judicial authorities."
"So let me ask again, and for the last time in this form, please make all the files available to the judicial authorities and do not say, as also happened again with ECHO: first the Commission decides whether there is a case to answer, and then it also decides what facts are relevant to resolving or clarifying that case."
"We would not be so persistent - as shown by my reference to ECHO - if this were a one-off case."
"But it is a problem we have been facing for quite some time."
"Hence our persistence here, the persistence of the rapporteur but also of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in the end, of the House itself."
"We all regret having to keep doing this."
"We hope we will come to a conclusion now and take a decision."
"I think perhaps we will, and we must also undertake to review these questions in depth in connection with the discharge."
"We must be prepared to do so, the Commission must be prepared to do so, but so must the Court of Auditors."
"I think we will also be discussing our relations with the Court of Auditors today and considering how rapidly we can deal with the questions that arise from this."
"After all, this report also shows that there is no point spending too long and too much time on formalities."
"We have asked enough specific questions in committee and had to wait too long for answers."
"That is another reason why we have had to come back to the same question twice in the space of about a year."
"We shall have to find other ways; they will be more precise and will certainly not involve any lesser degree of care."
"Let me perhaps make a final point on a question arising from this report but which has also come up repeatedly in the past. If someone criticises the implementation of a particular policy, it is always assumed that they are criticising the substance of that policy area."
"I believe that is unacceptable."
"It is done by public opinion, but it is also done here in this House, and I think the two are often confused during the debates."
"Mr Fabra Vallés said it all at the outset. It was in our interest to resume the MED programmes."
"We did all we could to enable the Commission to resume the programmes."
"That was our priority."
"But this could not detract from, or in a sense overshadow the fact that we are also looking at how they were implemented in the past, because our criticism of their implementation is fundamental and concerns the management of programmes in general and personnel management in general; then, in a sense, the affair of the MED programmes is merely an example of something we are criticising on principle."
"Then ECHO is merely an example of something we are criticising on principle, the tourism case was an example of a matter of principle, and we must all learn that we can criticise general structures on the basis of one example, and that this criticism goes far beyond the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, did we not all believe, or at least hope, that we had finally got to the end of the long saga of the MED programmes and that the Commission had taken action, after adopting a resolution on it more than a year ago and emphatically repeating key points of it when we postponed the discharge in the spring?"
"We were well wide of the mark!"
"As Mr Fabra Vallés has explained, instead of improvements, we have seen new information come to light which seems to show that the financial damage is far worse than we had hitherto assumed."
"This was discovered by a British auditing company which - and we grant the Commission this - was commissioned by Brussels to investigate completed MED programmes and projects."
"The auditors are looking into about half the completed projects and believe that some 4 million euros can be reclaimed."
"Let me ask the Commission: how much money has it actually recovered so far?"
"Have the rest of the projects been examined now, and what amount of repayments does that come to?"
"What conclusions does the Commission draw from the serious defects found by the auditing firm, such as over-subsidised projects, evidence which had disappeared and so on?"
"Why was UCLAF not brought in promptly, as the rapporteur says?"
"As regards the financial management of the Agency for the Trans-Mediterranean Networks - ARTM - the UK auditors make a devastating assessment, as did the Court of Auditors in its special report No 1/96."
"This brings us to one of the two main problems that led to the postponement of the discharge for 1996, namely the question of whether criminal fraud may be involved here, in addition to serious irregularities."
"For the Commission to entrust ARTM, an international association under Belgian law, with the financial management of the MED projects without any legal basis and without obtaining the opinion of the legal service or of financial control, for the management board members also to be managers of the technical assistance agencies and to be involved in awarding some project funds without tenders and thereby secure themselves a large slice of the cake, that is to say fat contracts, is to say the least an overlapping of interests, as is also the view of the Court of Auditors and UCLAF."
"Evidently the Commission has until now disregarded the clear advice of the Court of Auditors to the effect that these kinds of facts are punishable under Belgian law."
"But this matter can only be settled by the courts, which is why we call on the Commission for the third and last time to forward the entire file to the judicial authorities, so that they can at least examine the question of their competence and then, where appropriate, bring proceedings!"
"The second question in relation to the discharge for 1996 is how the Commission handles disciplinary proceedings."
"We believe that administrative inquiries and processes are no substitute for disciplinary proceedings and are not the appropriate way to prove the innocence of a possible suspect."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for his cooperation."
"In particular, I have been very pleased with the support there has been for a number of amendments we have tabled, and I am glad that we are agreed on an approach which is aimed at placing the responsibility on the Commission and not singling out particular officials, but insisting that it is the Commission which accepts the political responsibility for the situation."
"It must in fact be the case that the Commission must neither cover up for its officials nor hide behind them, but simply accept the responsibility for the fact that things are as they are."
"This is a very serious matter that we are dealing with today."
"How much time and effort we have spent on this which we would rather have used on other things!"
"I can only deplore the course of events, because the fact is that we cannot close the matter with this report, but once again have to call on the Commission to take action and once again say what steps we in Parliament will be obliged to take if the Commission does not comply with our requirements."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner if we can have a clear answer here and now as to whether the Commission will respond to paragraph 3 of the report and take the specific action which is being requested."
"Let us be clear today if it is willing to do so, or if it is simply going to cock a snook at Parliament's requests. If there is one thing that can shake our citizens' trust in the EU system, it is the suspicion that certain things are not happening in accordance with the rules, that irregularities are occurring, or that some people are engaging in a cover-up."
"For that reason, Commissioner, I cannot urge strongly enough that we should bring this matter to a conclusion and see that the necessary action is taken, so that we can all honestly say that we have rectified the mistakes and the shortcomings, as well as the procedures which are necessary to enable the Commission to live up to its responsibilities."
"Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of Mr Giansily who has been detained at another meeting."
"In spite of the serious and expert work carried out by Mr Fabra Vallés, we find the report on the repercussions of the MED programmes affair highly unsatisfactory."
"In fact, we believe that, far from clarifying the debate on the 1996 discharge, this report only makes the issue more confusing."
"The irregularities discovered in the management of the MED programmes, which meant that these programmes were suspended until the Commission relaunched them in April, involve more than a third of the appropriations used and the financial loss is much greater than was first supposed."
"As the rapporteur has clearly shown, the management of the MED programmes shows evidence of serious management problems for which the Commission is entirely responsible and for which it must accept the consequences, as provided for in the Treaties."
"This whole matter falls within the framework of the discharge procedure, which will be on the agenda in December."
"The instruments the European Parliament has at its disposal to mark its disapproval, or to punish the Commission, are the refusal to grant discharge and even the censure procedure."
"Further debate, in my view, is likely to weaken Parliament's position in the vote in December and I regret the fact that consideration of the MED programmes is not an integral part of the general report by Mr Elles on the discharge."
"Secondly, the petition to the Commission in the rapporteur's resolution is of little use when the European Parliament should judge the Commission on its financial auditing rather than following it through the maze of its administrative inquiries that are not sufficiently transparent."
"It is unfortunate that the rapporteur has not included any mention of the link between the irregularities discovered and the refusal to grant discharge, which is, however, at the heart of the debate."
"For our part, we are hoping for an objective debate on the discharge for the 1996 financial year."
"We hope, on the one hand, that genuine and frank questions will be asked regarding the irregularities and the fraud committed in the implementation of the MED programmes, for which responsibility lies with the Commission."
"And we hope, on the other hand, that Parliament shows no sign of weakness in exercising the powers of which it is guardian on behalf of Europe's citizens because, when all is said and done, is it not our citizens who have been deceived in this affair?"
"Mr President, we agree with the rapporteur as regards both his assessment of this particular case and the criticism that he levels at the Commission. We also go along with some of his proposals."
"This is not an issue on which we are giving our opinion for the first time. In the light of its seriousness, in that it refers to a collapse of the Union's financial resources - undoubtedly far greater than was initially thought -, it is politically embarrassing for the Commission."
"We might expect far more firmness and swiftness in starting disciplinary or judicial procedures against those responsible for the irregularities and fraud. Whenever there are suggestions that fraud has taken place, we might expect far more transparency and, in particular, an attitude of cooperation with the European Parliament, and especially with the relevant judicial authorities in the Member States."
"At this stage, we think it is very important that the Commission should forward the whole MED case-file to the Belgian, French and Italian courts or the European Parliament should act in its stead, making available all the evidence at its disposal and forwarding it to those national authorities."
"The Commission should do this as quickly as possibly, by 1 December, as our colleague Mr Fabra Vallés has asked."
"In any case, it should do so as soon as possible and if it does not, in my opinion, I do not see how we would grant the Commission the discharge."
"When assessing the discharge, a lot of things have to be taken into consideration, including whether or not the Commission has met our demands concerning this vital issue."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés for this excellent report."
"Many of us, both in the Green Group and in Parliament as a whole, are extremely upset about events surrounding the implementation of the MED programmes."
"It is not their content that is in dispute, but the way in which they have been administered."
"One of our foremost duties towards our electorate and the citizens of the EU is to act as a supervisory body."
"It is up to us to ensure that matters we discuss in this House are taken forward in a proper manner."
"The EU Treaties clearly give us the task of exercising this supervisory role."
"Since the MED programmes were last examined, new facts have come to light."
"Yet the Commission has still not produced the information we asked for initially - and which we need in order to fulfil our remit as a supervisory body for the EU."
"We must have the data if the Committee on Budgetary Control is to do its job. This is a serious matter."
"People could end up thinking that the Commission has something to hide. There is, after all, a possibility that its own officials might be involved in activities which could - at worst - entail criminal prosecution."
"The only way for the Commission to allay such suspicions is to come forward with the relevant documentation."
"We in the European Parliament need the material, and so do the judicial authorities. This is the last chance for the Commission."
"The Green Group naturally supports the tough - but patently necessary - conclusions drawn by the rapporteur."
"Mr President, last month the Committee on Budgetary Control had tabled a report by Mr Bösch, on the basis of Article 138b of the Treaty. The Presidency had to make it change the legal basis."
"This month it is retabling a report by Mr Fabra Vallés on the basis of Article 206 and the Presidency has told it that another legal basis must be adopted."
"I think that this is a bit of a mess and I feel I must draw attention to it because, in my opinion, if it is acceptable once, we will have to be more careful in the future before presenting reports before the House."
"The Court of Auditors has drawn up around 40 special reports over the last four or five years and Parliament has given its opinion on 10 reports in this House."
"As far as the MED affair is concerned, we have already had two reports and, in practice, we force the Commission to meet such short deadlines - by asking it, for example, to present documents within 10 days - that there may well be a third MED report."
"As a result, alongside Dynasty or Dallas, we will also have the MED soap opera with all the publicity it entails."
"I believe that Parliament has important control instruments at its disposal and that it must handle them well."
"It must not, in my view, resort to some sort of therapeutic persecution that hardly enhances the institutional balance or, more particularly, our own role."
"We have these instruments, and we must keep them. But please let us try to put an end to this saga."
"Our resolution of 31 March informing the Commission of the postponement of the 1996 discharge stated, in particular, that the Committee on Budgetary Control was to draw up a new report on the MED programmes on the basis of a report by the Commission on the financial audit of these programmes."
"It would appear today - and this has already been said - that the loss to the Community budget is significantly greater than had been originally assumed: a figure of almost ECU 10 million is mentioned."
"Indeed, the subsidies that were wrongly allocated are not spread evenly over all the projects; there are certain projects where more than 50 % of the subsidies paid are in serious doubt."
"The report by financial control not only confirms the appalling quality of the service provided by the agency the Commission entrusted with financial control of the trans-Mediterranean networks, but it also provides a great deal of information about how this agency was run and the relations it had with the Commission."
"We thus learn that when the two board members of the agency who were also managers of two technical assistance agencies were called on to resign from the board in order to put an end to an obvious conflict of interests, they made their resignation conditional on their firms being awarded new technical assistance contracts, and this condition was met by the Commission."
"Financial control's inquiry provides clear evidence that the selection procedures could have been rigged to make sure that the contracts did in fact go to the firms of the board members involved."
"So a whole network of firms largely managed to bring the implementation of a whole policy under their control, and they were able to do so because this was tolerated, if not encouraged, by Commission officials."
"The Commission can no longer claim that these are individual cases of fraud; we are most certainly dealing with an established system that has allowed firms to gain extensive access to Community funds."
"As such, we must now look at this in the context of the refusal to grant discharge and I am calling on the general rapporteur for the discharge to propose a decision to this effect."
"Mr President, let me first congratulate the rapporteur Mr Fabra Vallés on the energy he showed in drawing up and preparing this report, which was solidly supported by nearly all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It should be realised that the Committee on Budgetary Control addresses such issues because there are special reports by the Court of Auditors and these are becoming more numerous."
"Their number has increased significantly and it is impossible for the European Parliament not to react to those reports and to what they denounce."
"So it must be made clear - particularly to the Commission - that whilst we are neither the police nor detectives, we have to face up to our responsibilities in relation to denunciations by an official institutional body of the European Union."
"The details of the matter have been examined, in particular the role of the well-known Belgian companies which the Commission uses and seems to have used quite extensively to deal with things like the MED programmes."
"The general conclusion from this whole affair, Commissioner, is that there will have to be a structural change in the internal organisation of the Commission, a thing which all these phenomena show to be more necessary than might appear at first sight."
"The way the Commission functions must be reformed and restructured, because nobody in this Assembly wants to downgrade or debase the Commission."
"What irritates us is what I might call an apathy, a lack of reaction by the Commission to what both the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament are complaining about. Please react, and please do so in the right way."
"The MED cooperation programmes were initiated in 1990."
"The Council approved the legal basis for them in June 1992."
"The aim of MED programmes was to promote contacts and the transfer of know-how between the actors in the civil societies on both shores of the Mediterranean."
"Between 1992 and 1995 the Community financed 496 decentralised projects involving 2 000 participating operators."
"A total of approximately ECU 53m was allocated to these projects."
"What conclusions should we draw from this?"
"I would draw the conclusion that never have so many small projects been financed with such limited funds and limited administrative resources."
"The aims and the administrative requirements of MED programmes were not in line with the human resources that the Commission had at its disposal."
"There was significant pressure from Parliament to use the allocated credits quickly."
"The Commission signed a management contract with a Belgian organisation, ARTM."
"In October 1995, as has been mentioned here, a preliminary report by the Court of Auditors alerted the Commission to the alleged existence of irregularities in the management of the projects by ARTM."
"The Commission decided immediately to suspend the execution of MED programmes and the contract with ARTM in order to clarify the facts surrounding the alleged irregularities."
"On the basis of the audits carried out by the financial control of the Commission and the final report of the Court of Auditors published in May 1996, the Commission instructed its anti-fraud unit, UCLAF, to carry out an inquiry within and outside the Commission."
"UCLAF's final report of May 1997 could identify no cases giving rise to suspicion of fraud involving Commission officials."
"The rapporteur asked the Commission to submit the whole MED file to competent national judicial authorities by 1 December."
"There are, however, provisions governing the transmission of documents to judicial authorities."
"A sufficient presumption of fraud has to be established and this is the task of UCLAF."
"In its inquiries no sufficient presumption of fraud could be established."
"I will come back to this later."
"In order to shed light on the alleged mismanagement in the MED programmes, the Commission launched an administrative inquiry."
"I would like to stress that mismanagement is not the same thing as fraud."
"The latter would imply that the misappropriation of funds was intentional."
"The aim of an administrative inquiry is to establish facts for the appointing authority."
"The inquiry is carried out by a higher-ranking official or officials than the official who is the subject of the allegations of mismanagement."
"The outcome of the inquiry is a report that is submitted to the appointing authority."
"The administrative inquiry does not replace disciplinary procedure."
"It only establishes the basic information."
"The appointing authority decides on the opening of the disciplinary procedure as laid down in Article 87 of the Staff Regulations."
"In the case of the MED programmes an initial inquiry was carried out by one Director-General of the Commission."
"His report depicted a situation where Commission officials, highly committed to their aim of running the programmes under considerable political pressure, were always stretched because of the lack of appropriate resources."
"This situation had led officials to breach the principles of sound financial management, in particular when using the services of ARTM."
"In order to get the most complete picture of the programme management the competent Commissioners decided to complete the inquiry at the initiative of the Director-General for Personnel."
"A complementary inquiry was carried out by three DirectorsGeneral."
"They concluded in their report that there had been a failure to adhere to the principle of sound financial management."
"It was also noted that there had been a failure to recognise the risks of delegating administrative and technical tasks."
"In view of the difficult circumstances surrounding the management of the programmes, these three Directors-General did not recommend that the disciplinary procedure should be opened."
"The Commission endorsed the findings and conclusions of the report."
"A letter signed by the Secretary-General on behalf of the Commission was sent to the officials concerned expressing the dissatisfaction of the institution with their management performance."
"Both of these above-mentioned reports have been transmitted to Parliament."
"The rapporteur asked the Commission to submit to Parliament the minutes of the hearings carried out in its administrative inquiries."
"In this we must be careful to strike the right balance between two requirements."
"Firstly, the people who are questioned in an administrative inquiry have the right to confidentiality."
"Secondly, Parliament has a responsibility to monitor the implementation of the budget and the right to be provided with information as laid down in Article 206 of the Treaty."
"In order to reconcile these two imperatives, the Commission has approached Parliament with the aim of the two institutions drafting a code of conduct together on access to documents."
"The first meeting between the representatives of the institutions is scheduled for this week."
"The purpose is to involve the legal services of both institutions in the process."
"The Commission hopes that an agreement can be concluded at the highest possible level."
"In addition to the abovementioned measures related to management of the programmes the Commission also ordered, as has already been said, an external audit with the aim of helping to identify all the expenditure that is not strictly in line with contracts or the rules of accounting."
"The audited projects equal 70 % of the net expenditure used."
"This audit was carried out by a firm of auditors."
"A private firm cannot decide whether the expenditure is appropriate."
"That is for the authorising services, under the financial control of the Commission."
"On the basis of the external audit report submitted at the end of August this year, authorising services have begun to examine, project by project, the information gathered by the external auditor."
"The results of this examination will be verified by the financial control of the Commission as a whole."
"The Commission will submit an interim report of the results to Parliament by 1 December."
"Taking into account the huge amount of work involved in examining the 233 audited projects, the interim report will cover approximately 50 to 70 projects, leading to the first issue of recovery orders."
"The work will have to continue and the services of the Commission expect it to be finalised by the end of January 1999."
"If expenditure is found to be ineligible, recovery orders will be sent out."
"The Commission will do everything in its power to ensure as much money as possible is recovered."
"Should there be any suspicion of fraud in relation to any operator, the case would be referred to UCLAF."
"If UCLAF then finds sufficient grounds for suspicion likely to lead to criminal charges, the file would be transmitted to the competent national judicial authorities."
"In any case, any operator who has not met his contractual obligations will be excluded from receiving financing for new programmes."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Combating fraud - Protection of the euro - Action against organised crime"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two mistakes which people make that seriously hamper us in our fight against organised crime."
"The first mistake is to say that we are dealing mainly with drugs-related crime."
"The second is to say that we are dealing mainly with the most serious crimes, such as murder."
"In fact, organised crime is crime that is organised on the basis of a division of labour, on a systematic, daily, hierarchical basis, rather like the way a company is organised, but using illegal means."
"The problems arise because of the sum of the damage, not the individual damage, and they arise because ill-gotten gains are channelled back into the normal economic cycle through money-laundering operations."
"One example is fraud with non-cash means of payment - in short, plastic money and credit cards."
"I can illustrate this with an example. If a briefcase is stolen in Brussels, this may be an individual act by a criminal who wants money, perhaps to buy drugs."
"But it could also be part of a process: specialists, groups of pickpockets, are flown in from Latin America - there are special schools there to train them - work the city and then disappear again in the evening by plane."
"The stolen credit cards are flown on by plane to other parts of the world the same night and used there to buy goods, which receivers of stolen goods then convert back into cash, which is then channelled back into the normal economic cycle through money-laundering operations."
"As far as we know, credit-card crime is usually organised crime and crime that operates internationally in the way I have described. The damage worldwide comes to about USD 3 billion a year, of which a quarter falls to the European Community's account."
"So there is a need for us to act, and it is therefore a good thing that the Commission has submitted proposals for a joint action."
"These proposals are aimed, firstly, at harmonising the law, because we have totally different criminal laws for the crimes I have described."
"To give one example: in my country, neither the manufacture nor the possession of forged credit cards was a crime until April this year."
"So I could have opened a factory to make them and could have marketed them freely."
"Nobody would have said a word."
"The Commission wants to close these legal loopholes, and we welcome that."
"Secondly, we very much need to make means of payment such as credit cards more secure."
"The market does not automatically guarantee maximum security; the sector weighs up the goods and carries out a cost-benefit analysis between security on the one hand and the cost of security on the other."
"That is why the result does not provide maximum security, but only precisely the level determined by the cost-benefit calculation."
"But it is important to society to have a high standard of security if it is to combat organised crime consistently."
"That is why, in my report, Parliament submits a number of proposals."
"Let me draw your attention to three of them, which are obviously reasonable. In future, we want a better method to be found for issuing credit cards, because sending them by post, as is usually done now, is too unsafe."
"These credit cards have security marks."
"Every credit-card issuer uses a different one."
"No cashier can remember them all."
"So we want to see them standardised."
"Thirdly, in the long term there is no alternative to replacing the signature used for paying by plastic card with a numerical code, as in the case of the Eurocheque card, and a chip."
"Another problem we will have to tackle is counterfeit coins and notes."
"Here again, we must distinguish between two cases. There are what are known as home-worker counterfeiters, who try to counterfeit notes using a colour photocopier."
"We are less concerned with them."
"But then there is large-scale money counterfeiting, carried out by organised crime."
"Introducing the euro as cash will create special risks."
"Firstly, this is because the euro is a new currency whose appearance people are not yet familiar with."
"Secondly, it is because organised crime predominantly counterfeits what are known as reserve currencies, which means currencies that can be placed globally."
"Thirdly, it is because criminal prosecution authorities and the police in the various Member States of the European Community have different experiences, because, conversely, there are also currencies that have hardly ever been counterfeited in the past."
"That is why the national authorities have little experience there."
"So we welcome the fact that the Commission is presenting a communication and putting forward proposals."
"Much of it we endorse."
"But our specialist committee does not approve the special role the Commission has assigned itself in this communication in relation to combating counterfeiting of the euro in future."
"Underlying this special role is the assumption that, as in the case of fraud against the Community, the interests of the Member States as such are not really affected."
"Fraud against the Community is after all, according to this view, money lost to the Community budget and not the national budgets."
"But in the case of counterfeit money, things are different."
"Here the Member States certainly have a marked interest."
"We have serious reservations about allocating too much responsibility to UCLAF in this respect when we look at the Bösch report, which described the situation of UCLAF clearly enough."
"Let me put it in somewhat provocative terms, Mr President: the euro is too important for the matter to be left in the hands of UCLAF."
"So we suggest retaining the existing and proven system of cooperation between criminal prosecution authorities, police forces, central banks and cash acceptance points and supplementing this system by organising the rapid exchange of information and by giving Europol new responsibilities."
"Mr President, it was a year ago that the European Parliament considered the action plan to combat organised crime."
"The focus then was on 'acute' intervention."
"This was to be enforcement-oriented, but I pointed out at the time that preventive action was just as necessary."
"Anti-crime strategies require a long-term perspective and this was one of the areas where I found the Council's approach wanting."
"Civil society has a key role to play in strengthening people's sense of identity, helping them to resist temptation and say no to crime."
"The family also bears responsibility for passing on decent values to children."
"Citing my report as the trigger, the Council has now come back with a proposal for a preventive strategy."
"This is a novel occurrence in the third pillar area and I commend the Council's initiative."
"We now have some scope for constructive debate and a fruitful exchange of ideas."
"What a pity Commissioner Gradin cannot be here."
"Although we all appreciate the need to set priorities, a key person's absence on a particular issue can only reflect the degree of importance which is attached to it."
"Perhaps this is primarily a Council matter."
"It is certainly good to see the Council represented, but I would have liked Commissioner Gradin to be in attendance too."
"I note with pleasure, however, that Commissioner Liikanen is here with us."
"There was a remarkable show of consensus in committee, and I would thank my colleagues for their positive contributions."
"What we need is a strategy to develop a truly European civil society, alert to how early in life criminal behaviour is engendered and how fast it spreads. We can then take appropriate measures at national, local and regional levels to nip in the bud any drift towards a criminal lifestyle."
"Voluntary organisations, churches, schools, friends and family - all these make up civil society. And it is to civil society that we should look in order to derive the strength to resist crime."
"It is no good leaving everything to politicians and letting people think that the State will right all the wrongs."
"Social engineering, rather then protecting against crime, tends to weaken resistance."
"I have seen this happen in my own country, Sweden."
"We must be aware of the danger of 'everyday' crime and be ready to react before the petty offender becomes drawn into serious, international crime."
"People should take responsibility for one another, and this means empowering individuals so that they want to care."
"To put it figuratively, we need to create the software to be used with the hardware of law enforcement."
"It is vital that Member States ratify the existing conventions."
"Full use is not being made of the instruments at hand."
"Nor has the action plan to combat organised crime been sufficiently developed."
"There were 30 points in the original text and barely half have been implemented. Progress is still awaited in 18 areas."
"We can learn from each other and promote those crime prevention measures that have proved effective. Everyone would like to live in a society where they can feel safe and secure."
"This is particularly relevant in the case of the applicant countries, where the crime problem is worse than here."
"Worst of all, though, is the transformation in attitudes that takes place in a society where crime becomes generally accepted as part of everyday life. If criminal behaviour becomes the norm in a community, that community is in trouble."
"The applicant countries should be encouraged to develop long-term crime prevention strategies; the impact will be felt across the Union."
"We need to vaccinate ourselves mentally against crime."
"Our societies will become less susceptible once the fundamental values we all share become more firmly enshrined through increased public awareness. Work will need to be done at both practical and 'human' levels."
"Some of the EU states border on countries with crime levels that are inconceivable to us here in the West."
"The prevalence of protection rackets is an example."
"In one country not so very far away from here, up to 70 % of companies pay protection money to crime syndicates."
"Once criminal activity is allowed to penetrate so deeply into an economy, both democracy and market principles are under threat."
"Fundamental values go overboard and policy-making in other areas loses its meaning."
"If we lose our grip on crime, we shall be destined to fail elsewhere too."
"Pressure on each and every Member State must be maintained."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking you for giving me the opportunity today to visit the European Parliament's plenary."
"As a member of the government who does not belong to any political party but will soon be able to look back on eight years of experience as Minister for Justice in the Austrian Republic, I have particular respect for the activities and responsibility of the Members of the European Parliament and very much appreciate the significant role the European Parliament plays in the pursuit of justice and democracy within the process of European integration."
"Accordingly, the Austrian Presidency is endeavouring to cooperate closely with the European Parliament in its activities."
"Let me also use my visit here as an opportunity to make some comments on the subjects of this joint debate from the Austrian Presidency's point of view."
"Turning first to the non-cash means of payment: the possibility of obtaining services from third parties without having to carry the corresponding cash - generally by using a debit card - not only makes life easier and things more flexible, but also paves the way to new forms of abuse."
"The Commission recognised this risk early on and submitted proposals on how to reduce it."
"The presidency welcomes the Commission's initiative, because we too realise that action is certainly needed here."
"The working group on Community law and national criminal law has already held an initial exchange of views on the matter."
"Without wishing to anticipate the working group's conclusions, I do regard it as very helpful with regard to our further progress that the Commission chose to forward its communication to Parliament quickly, thus enabling Parliament to give its opinion at an early stage and the Council to take due account of it in its deliberations."
"The subject of the Commission's second communication, protection of the euro against counterfeiting, on which Mr Schmid has drawn up his report, is equally important for the future."
"The Austrian Presidency agrees with the Commission and the European Parliament that we must do our utmost to protect the euro against counterfeiting."
"On the one hand we must give special attention to the appropriate preventive measures, and on the other we must also ensure that we have sound measures for prosecuting counterfeiters from the moment the euro coins and banknotes are issued."
"One key question here will probably be how to demarcate the responsibilities of the various institutions involved - where, as I know, there are different views - clearly and carefully enough to ensure effective protection of the euro; here, I believe, Europol will also have a major role to play."
"With regard to criminal law, I can tell you that the Council working group responsible has already embarked on the necessary preparatory work."
"First we must gain an overview of the provisions in force in the Member States and establish to what extent we need to approximate the legal provisions."
"On the basis of this preparatory work, we will then have to propose a legal act, aimed at approximating the Member States' legal provisions."
"The aim will be to ensure that certain forms of conduct are regarded as punishable offences in all the Member States."
"However, the presidency regards it as rather difficult and not very useful to approximate the penalties so long as the general penal provisions, especially the prosecution system, the list of penalties, the imposition of penalties and the conditions governing mitigation are based on different systems."
"What we must ensure, however, is that we do not prevent the Member States from cooperating effectively in relation to mutual assistance and extradition provisions"
"Let me conclude with a word on the resolution on prevention which the Council intends to draw up."
"We followed with great attention the European Parliament's in-depth consideration of the action plan to combat organised crime."
"The presidency took the European Parliament's resolution of 20 November 1997 as an incentive to propose an amendment to the Council in the important area of the prevention of organised crime."
"That is why we also forwarded the presidency's draft resolution on preventive measures to combat organised crime to the European Parliament for information, although even the Amsterdam Treaty does not make provision for Parliament to be formally consulted on draft resolutions of the Council."
"The multidisciplinary group on organised crime has discussed the draft in depth and will probably adopt it at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 and 4 December."
"This resolution seeks to address all aspects of preventing organised crime in a comprehensive manner."
"Special emphasis is placed on the need to coordinate state measures with civil society in any attempt to reduce the incentive to commit crimes and take preventive measures against organised crime."
"In line with the horizontal nature of prevention, it addresses areas in the first and third pillar of the European Union, although emphasis is also placed on the Member States' responsibility at national, regional and local level."
"In this context, we attach great importance to the preparation of national preventive programmes, the creation of interdisciplinary and interinstitutional crime prevention councils and, above all, the evaluation and assessment of preventive activities."
"I believe this resolution is a first major step forward, which I hope will be followed by others."
"Let me end on that note - I thank you for your attention and hope for further good cooperation between Parliament and the presidency!"
"Mr President, I should like to compliment both rapporteurs - both our colleagues have done a good job - and to make one preliminary remark."
"I think it is appropriate to point out that the House is now discussing for the umpteenth time matters related to the somewhat new institutional exercise of fighting for lawfulness, in other words against crime."
"I was very pleased to hear the President-in-Office stressing the value of Parliament's role and contribution."
"Now, post-Amsterdam, Parliament is playing a very important leading role in some ways, particularly in respect of an initiative which has perhaps been somewhat underestimated, namely the newly created area of freedom, security and law."
"These are new issues, but that is perhaps why Parliament's contribution is so significant, as the Minister clearly acknowledges: we are not restricting ourselves to requests and aspirations, but are attempting to identify tangible means of implementing aims and objectives which are of deep concern to the citizens of Europe."
"I emphasise this point because I think that both rapporteurs rightly draw attention in their reports to the very important proactive role being sought by Parliament."
"I would dwell in particular on the question of crime prevention, as dealt with in the Cederschiöld report."
"I believe that this is the key point picked up by the Council from the first report on organised crime and proposed afresh in its draft resolution, given that any steps taken collectively by a society or community to reduce - if not avert - outbreaks of crime count as prevention."
"A range of measures therefore exists; we need only think of corruption."
"As far as corruption is concerned, most of what needs to be done is preventive: the culture of political back-scratching and patronage must be combated; the guiding rule in relations between institutions and citizens must be the transparency of operations."
"We have raised all these aspects of prevention in an amendment, calling for a code of conduct and attention to new occupational groups which can easily fall prey to corruption or organised crime."
"We have done so in order to stress the importance of preventive action when faced with change."
"I would however point out here - as we state in another amendment - that preventive action is also very much a matter of partnership between institutions and civil society."
"I would remind you all of the concept of educating people to remain within the law."
"Two years ago, our committee held some remarkable consultations with an Italian organisation - called 'Libera' - which is an umbrella organisation encompassing some 600 civil associations."
"Its members described the work they are doing to combat organised crime in Italy, and told us how they were attempting to stamp it out in the worst affected regions."
"We heard from Rita Borsellino, the sister of Judge Borsellino, whose commitment testifies to the importance - not only for the sake of her brother's memory, but in order to combat the mafia - of a struggle based on a deep commitment by society to conveying the message of lawfulness."
"I would just refer finally to preventive action against urban crime and petty crime."
"Here I think that there is now greater awareness: it has been understood that repression, where it is necessary, must be combined with prevention."
"The work being done on the ground, in a joint effort by institutions and civil society, inspires hope that it will be possible to reduce this huge amount of crime, this enormous sense of danger which is making our cities and citizens feel unsafe - according to a recent survey, 33 % of people felt unsafe in cities in 1996."
"But what is to be done?"
"Should we put police on every street corner?"
"No, that would serve no purpose; it would probably be both wrong and impossible."
"We must establish a close link between prevention, work on the ground, concrete measures, monitoring and controls."
"Mr President, there can no longer be any doubt that the Single Market, the information society, technological inventions, the Internet, financial services and electronic commerce have revolutionised the use of non-cash means of payment."
"Turnover for payment cards alone exceeds $US 2 000 billion a year throughout the world."
"This huge market has also given rise to new forms of computer piracy and crime specialising in fraud and counterfeiting, or so-called cybercrime. Something therefore needs to be done to protect the interests of those issuing, using, being paid by or acquiring these new means of payment."
"That is why we need to harmonise the systems of controls and penalties in the Member States to guarantee the euro's credibility and security, even in the intermediate phase from 1999 to 2002."
"The Commission should be congratulated on the initiatives that it is taking and, generally speaking, the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, deserves our support. But now allow me to turn to the report itself."
"There are, however, some points for concern."
"For example, on the subject of combating the falsification of euro notes and coins, the Commission statement calls for close cooperation and mutual assistance between UCLAF, the ECB and Europol."
"But the future role of UCLAF still has to be clearly defined and, in the wake of cases of fraud at ECHO, the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, has just publicly announced the Commission's intention to transform the UCLAF into OLAF, a body completely independent of the Commission, extending its inquiries and investigations to all Community institutions. That would then leave it for the Commission to focus on the legislative proposals and coordination with the Member States in the fight against fraud, in the interest of the European Union, as would be the case of counterfeiting the euro."
"But doubts linger and this lack of definition needs to be cleared up."
"In the end, who is going to supervise what?"
"Will it involve UCLAF, OLAF or the Commission?"
"We must in any case continue to compile, assess and update data on money counterfeiting practices, circuits and networks if we are to protect the euro."
"It is therefore very worrying that there is no specific idea of the type of information to be included in the database, but we hope for a joint effort on the part of those actually responsible for issuing the coin, the courts, the police and financial bodies."
"In other words, we are looking into it."
"But time is short."
"These legislative instruments need to be adopted at the latest at some time in the year 2000 so that the comprehensive euro protection system can be operational as of 1 January 2002, in order to be tested before the euro notes and coins are brought into circulation."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the two rapporteurs for the work they have both done on this issue."
"The fight against fraud and the need to establish a comprehensive system to prevent the counterfeiting of means of payment is of key importance, not only for governments but also for all the citizens of the European Union."
"The Commission's communication on the counterfeiting and protection of the euro along with the amendments adopted are a positive and practical contribution to the fight against fraud."
"It is a start, but it is not the end."
"One of the main objectives is to ensure that these cases of fraud are treated as criminal offences in all the Member States."
"We also need an efficient system to protect the euro."
"The most important element is to make sure that the euro has a uniform level of protection throughout the entire Union."
"Europol's responsibilities in combating counterfeiting should be extended."
"The euro has a very high potential circulation, which means that there is the risk of counterfeiting both within and outside the European Union."
"We are therefore going to call for an information system for the rapid exchange of data between the authorities responsible for combating counterfeiting."
"It is very unfortunate that the implementation of the action plan to combat organised crime is so far behind schedule."
"The Council must ensure that all its recommendations enter into force and become effective by the end of next year."
"The only aspect of the report by Mrs Cederschiöld that concerns me is the link between the measures to prevent organised crime and electoral procedures."
"That has no place in this report, which, apart from this, has my full support."
"Mr President, I have three points to make on this report."
"Firstly, it is common knowledge that any real semblance of control over movements of goods around the Union has gone, demonstrating that the much trumpeted vision of a Europe without frontiers is a dangerous illusion."
"The whole enterprise merely encourages criminal dealings."
"Experience has shown that free trade is not undermined by proper and efficient border controls. The free trade system should facilitate lawful activity, not crime."
"We therefore need effective controls for goods and persons at the EU's national frontiers."
"My second point concerns corruption and mafia-style activities."
"Perhaps we could contribute to the fight against this type of crime by introducing a system of open government and public accountability. This is not something people necessarily think of in such a context, but the Nordic countries are committed to the principle of public access to official records."
"Ordinary citizens, as well as journalists, have a right to consult documents and paperwork produced by public authorities. This means that the general public is able to monitor financial management within government departments."
"I believe that the low levels of corruption we find in the Nordic countries can partly be attributed to this system of open access to documents."
"As well as enabling facts to be uncovered, the system also has a deterrent effect in terms of crime."
"Lastly, the EU now boasts three groupings operating in the field of police cooperation: Schengen, Interpol and Europol."
"I wonder if we should be splitting up our anti-crime effort in this way."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for the work they have done."
"Democratic societies do indeed have a duty to make maximum efforts to combat organised crime and corruption in all their guises."
"Yet a balance has to be struck between effective anti-crime strategies, on the one hand, and the freedom of the individual and legal certainty on the other."
"We cannot allow ourselves to become a Big Brother society."
"My group has been highly critical, for example, of the holding of detailed files on individuals under the umbrella of Schengen and Europol."
"I also have reservations about the widespread use of global interception systems. These may well yield results in terms of combating crime, but the effects on democracy and civil liberties are not to be countenanced."
"I commend the way in which Mrs Cederschiöld has managed to find a balance between ends and means in this report."
"I fully support her call for more work on crime prevention, and she is right to point out that the proposals still fall short on specific prevention measures."
"I agree on the role of civil society and the importance of setting long-term targets, and transparency and public accountability are essential in this context."
"Yet there is another dimension if we want to stop the rifts that already exist in our societies from widening. We need more job opportunities, better education provision and a fairer distribution of resources."
"I have one final point."
"Mrs Cederschiöld talks about combating crime at European level, but we know that organised crime reaches beyond the frontiers of Europe."
"I am therefore in favour of working with Interpol and other international bodies too."
"Mr President, the report by Mrs Cederschiöld must be congratulated for having highlighted the often subtle distinction between organised crime and less serious crime and between prevention and repression, despite the complexities all these concepts involve."
"We will certainly vote in favour of this report, even though it appears to be somewhat reliant on a political magic wand."
"We must of course - and I am merely quoting here - encourage citizens to cooperate with the judicial authorities, guarantee the protection of witnesses, and promote policing at a level that is closer to citizens. We need a reduction in factors that encourage and a promotion of factors that discourage crime."
"We must promote the integration of marginalised groups. Everyone will be in complete agreement with these issues."
"There is one specific area that needs to be defined here, and that is the prevention of repeat offending, which falls somewhere between prevention and repression."
"Prevention is an extremely important factor and is linked to the quality of penal institutions and their ability to assist the social reintegration of offenders."
"Significant efforts must be made in this area and they must be targeted."
"They are going to cost money and will require a great deal of imagination and intelligence. Whatever else happens, we must at least be prepared to agree to make this effort."
"Let us remember that."
"Mr President, the European Union only has legitimacy when it acts more efficiently than the Member States acting individually."
"Organised crime is the very type of harmful activity that calls for action at European level."
"The report by Mrs Cederschiöld rightly stresses the need for the Council to propose concrete measures and to involve the applicant countries that hope to join the European Union in whatever prevention measures might be established by the Council."
"Unfortunately, we know that those countries, and particularly the countries of central and eastern Europe, have been left in a dreadful state of moral and economic decline by Marxist-Leninism."
"It is therefore highly desirable that from now on they should be involved in the work we ourselves can do within the European Union."
"The rapporteur also rightly emphasises the need to involve civil society in the prevention of organised crime."
"Prevention from within society is necessary but its effectiveness depends on society's general state of mind and on the promotion of values that are all too often scorned, such as a sense of responsibility, of duty, of honesty and of work."
"In short, it is also a matter of how civilised we are."
"The prevailing relativism, the loss of reference points, a libertarian idea of freedom, individualism taken to its extreme, and the puerile desire to reject what are known as supposedly middle-class social conventions are all elements that, in fact, fuel everyday crime, which itself undermines the foundations of civil peace and acts as a basis for organised crime."
"Mrs Cederschiöld has also rightly highlighted the damaging effects of poor town planning."
"We will support her report apart from the elements that relate, strangely, to voting rights and the prevention of crime."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I share your concern about the problems raised in the Schmid report."
"There can be no question that we need a coordinated approach at European level here."
"Some time ago I put a question to the Commission on protecting the euro from counterfeiting, but only received a rather evasive answer."
"The fact that the rapporteur believes that the euro will act as a magnet for criminal activity and that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also believes that the euro will be an extremely attractive target for counterfeiting confirms me in my view."
"The overall package of proposals to protect the euro from counterfeiting and fraud does, however, seem to be a useful instrument for tackling these problems."
"Here I wish to highlight the new regulatory system for harmonising criminal law, which I regard as very useful."
"I see the idea of laying down the framework, determining the crucial features, but leaving it to the Member States to formulate them in terms of their own criminal law systems, as a step forward in the right direction."
"Past attempts to formulate case materials on a Europe-wide basis, as in the corpus juris , gave rise to a great many problems and conflicts between systems."
"I believe that the legislative method which has now been proposed for approximating the Member States' different, historically based legal systems is a better one, and we approve it, as we do all the other points made in the report."
"Mr President, I congratulate the two rapporteurs on their two reports and the three accompanying resolutions."
"Mr Schmid and Mrs Cederschiöld have done an important job here in dealing with issues that are vital to the future of the European Union."
"I am talking about combating fraud in the non-cash sector, combating counterfeiting and action against organised crime."
"Most of the points I want to make are in relation to Mr Schmid's report."
"There are three main points."
"Firstly, it is a wonderful opportunity, with the switch-over to the euro from national currencies, to catch those who have currently got large sums of illgotten gains hidden under the bed or somewhere else and are going to have to switch from deutschmarks or francs, from pesetas or lire into euros."
"What I hope we are going to see is some coordinated action at European level to try and take advantage of this opportunity."
"We need special reporting requirements on currency exchanges around the time of the switch-over to the euro and we need a European-wide organisation of police and customs officials working together to see how much of the grey or black money we can detect when criminals have to move across from their own national currencies to the euro."
"Secondly, with respect to non-cash fraud: I am pleased that in the report we complain about the fact that the banks do not worry very often because they offload the cost onto the customers."
"We should be looking at using new technologies for identification to help protect the customer - via new biometric patterns for example."
"Retinal patterns are very successful in allowing you to identify unambiguously the owner of a car."
"That will be something that can be used at cash points."
"But, secondly, we should be allowed to use the highest available means of encryption that cannot be broken to protect these transactions."
"At the moment I understand the Commission is apparently negotiating with the US Government to limit our ability to encrypt electronic transactions."
"This is very foolish in the light of this particular report."
"With respect to cash fraud, the euro will be reasonably well-protected."
"We have a problem with the euro coins, where we are allowing national characteristics on coins."
"Unless we have a plan to sort out those coins and send them back to their countries of origin, the average shop, after a comparatively short period of time, will have to deal with recognising 120 different coins if we are going to have six coins from the 15 states of the European Union, and added to that coins from Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican City and Gibraltar."
"That seems to me to be complete nonsense and we should try to remove it later with legislation to enable shops to have a fairly small number of coins to identify rather than the enormous number that the rather foolish earlier decision will lead to."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know from a reliable source that about 30 % of all crime is now organised crime."
"Given that the business of organised crime now extends from credit-card fraud to traffic in human beings and to money laundering, there is obviously an absolute need for action not just in the Member States but also by the European Community."
"We must give absolute priority to combating organised crime, as both the rapporteurs say."
"What we need, without any doubt, is a combination of repressive and preventive measures."
"Let me just take up three points which I see as especially important in terms of combating crime."
"The first is that we, the European Community, must finally transpose the measures and the action plan which the Community has adopted."
"We must set aside national animosities in the interests of Europe-wide cooperation in combating crime and make efficient use of the instruments we have at our disposal, such as Europol and UCLAF."
"The second point concerns expanding judicial cooperation."
"We are still at the beginning here: we have proposed some useful steps forward, but what we need to do is to harmonise criminal provisions relating to new types of offences, such as credit-card fraud, money laundering, environmental crime and gangs."
"The third point, which I think needs very special emphasis, is that we must export security to the applicant Central and Eastern European countries that are seeking to join the European Union."
"We should help them to implement these programmes in the interest of Europe and in their own interest."
"The fight against organised crime must be intensified and expanded."
"That is what our citizens expect of the European Union, and it is absolutely vital to the security of the European Union as a whole."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that the European Central Bank is set to establish an Analysis centre for counterfeits."
"The relevant statistical and technical data will be stored as a database to which national central banks will have full access."
"As of now no more precise details have been given by the European Central Bank but I am sure these will come in due course."
"I welcome the fact that the Central Bank is taking this initiative at such an early stage of its inception."
"This is important because 13 billion euro banknotes will be printed by January 2002 when they will be brought into circulation within the 11 Member States encompassing a population of some 290 million people."
"It is very important that this Analysis centre for counterfeits should work closely not only with national central banks but also with Europol and the national police forces within the 11 Member States participating in the new single currency regime."
"The Amsterdam Treaty is giving more powers to Europol in the area of judicial and police cooperation and this Treaty is set to be ratified shortly."
"Parliament must ensure that any financial resources which will be required by the Central Bank for the working of this new Analysis centre for counterfeits should be supported so that the evil of this prospective counterfeiting of euro notes is defeated."
"Mr President, we all - I believe - agree on the need to combat crime effectively. But I must add that we must not be too naive about the real effectiveness of the various preventive measures summarised in the second report we now have before us."
"The simple reality is that in many large and medium-sized towns in Europe there are whole streets and neighbourhoods which the police no longer dare enter, where there is virtually no longer any public transport and where the plucky citizens who remain, those who lack the resources to move elsewhere, are exposed to the laws of the jungle."
"In other words, we must have the courage to acknowledge that this prevention policy of ours has failed."
"Out there, in these neighbourhoods, it is well past the eleventh hour. The time has come to crack down hard and to take repressive action in order, if necessary, to restore law and order by force."
"First things first."
"Prevention is important but I believe this tough approach must take first priority, contrary to what is stated in this report."
"I also regret that Parliament is afraid to speak out clearly when it comes to the subject of crime committed by foreigners."
"The second report just beats about the bush."
"We all know that, regretfully, 90 % of so-called street crimes in the major towns and cities are committed by uprooted people, uprooted foreigners, often second or third generation immigrants."
"We are not going to solve this huge problem by continuing to deny its existence or by trying to falsify the statistics by means of more flexible naturalisation procedures."
"We will also certainly not solve it by granting active and passive voting rights such as this report, to everyone's surprise, I would imagine, dares to propose."
"The only short-term solution is a courageous policy which presents those involved with a choice."
"Either integrate yourselves into our society, and thus respect its laws, customs and culture, or opt for supported and accompanied return to your cultural home where you will no longer be uprooted."
"Just because this solution has been declared taboo does not mean that it is not a decent and proper solution."
"Mr President, I am glad to be able to make a few more comments on the problem of preventing organised crime."
"Repression and prevention are two equally valid means of combating crime, including organised crime."
"However, we must realise that the traditional concepts of prevention will not work here."
"Let me explain this: the common belief that we can do something about organised crime by combating poverty and unemployment overlooks the real problem."
"Organised criminals are not usually poor people - on the contrary!"
"There are some chances of success in the field of technical prevention, that is to say technical precautions to prevent crime."
"These include the prevention of car theft by fitting immobilisers, preventing credit-card fraud by making this means of payment more secure, introducing better rules with regard to some areas of what is called hi-tech crime, and introducing better data comparison precautions in fields such as social security fraud, as are widely found in the United States."
"Another question concerns the drying-up of markets."
"Organised crime often involves the supply of illegal goods and services."
"We will not manage to combat that in all cases."
"With regard to drugs, for instance, there are good reasons for not legalising them."
"On the other hand, there is no reason whatsoever for the state to retain its monopoly on gambling."
"Nor is there any reason for driving a system which has obviously been a social need for centuries, namely prostitution -whatever we may think of it as such - into the grey area of the semi-legal, which would only turn it into a seedbed for organised crime."
"Mr President, I should like to comment briefly on matters related to the euro."
"I am particularly anxious to speak about this issue because I am concerned about the way this debate is developing."
"The euro needs to generate confidence."
"However, the debate has not been particularly helpful in this regard. Too many speakers have expressed concern about the risks of counterfeiting even coins, which is in fact quite difficult to achieve."
"The first thing that should be said is that the European Central Bank guarantees the notes and coins issued. Furthermore, Interpol, Europol, the police forces of the Member States and the Member States themselves now have at their disposal means of controlling fraud and counterfeiting through the legal and penal systems."
"This should boost confidence."
"Our role is not to be alarmist nor to think of the arrival of the euro as the very opportunity for deceit all the European mafias are eagerly awaiting."
"Our role in this House is to support the Commission and the European Central Bank, and to facilitate their task. For instance, we should try to ensure that Europol has arrangements in place to coordinate the attack to be launched by all the national police forces and by Interpol."
"We must also support the Commission once it has prepared more detailed proposals and presented them to Parliament."
"The citizens need to know that we are aware of the possible risks of counterfeiting, but they must also know that in this instance, 15 police forces will be working alongside Interpol and Europol."
"Our task is to enable appropriate legal provision to be made to ensure that detailed particulars on the type of offences are readily available, as stated in the report."
"We should do all we can to promote confidence in the euro. It does need it."
"Fortunately, control does not depend solely on us, as we shall be assisted by many others."
"Mr President, the Commission is very satisfied with Mrs Cederschiöld's report on ways we may best prevent organised crime from taking root in society."
"We have to get to the core of the problem and devise a strategy for the prevention of problems, with all parties in the Community taking part at national and local level."
"Ridding ourselves of crime can only succeed if we make use of all the means available to the constitutional state."
"The rapporteur justifiably stresses the need to support common measures taken by citizens against organised crime in the constitutional state."
"In the area of money laundering the Commission has applied legislation under the first pillar to prevent the circulation through laundering of money obtained from selling drugs."
"At the start of 1999 the directive will be broadened to cover suspect business activity linked with smuggling, other than drug-smuggling."
"In the area of telecommunications the Commission issued a communication in May 1998 on the protection of minors and human dignity in general in audio-visual and Internet contexts."
"This is a good example of a case where national legislation is not enough to ensure that we are rid of crime, but where action at Union level is needed."
"As Members of Parliament know, the Commission has initiated a number of projects under the Falcone programme in conjunction with the Member States and NGOs."
"The rapporteur made special mention of the need to support employment, health, family, and social policy, so that the security of the immediate environment of our citizens might be improved."
"The Commission fully supports these objectives."
"Similarly, there is support for citizens' local services."
"The issue has been raised in a communication on city policy, which is to be presented at the Europaforum Wien Centre for Urban Dialogue in Vienna at the end of November."
"Crime in our cities is a real problem, as it is based on organised crime, which threatens cross-border social order."
"The unambiguous aim of the Commission is to create a pan-European area where freedom, safety and justice prevail."
"With the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam this goal has moved a lot nearer."
"The heads of state and government have already agreed to meet in Tampere, Finland, in October 1999, to discuss priority aims and deadlines in this important area."
"The report by Charlotte Cederschiöld will form part of the foundations upon which the Commission's work will be built."
"Moving on to Mr Schmid's report, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate the rapporteur, who, in very clear terms, raises the issue of the connection between the Commission's proposal on fraud and counterfeiting in non-cash transactions with fraud and counterfeiting specifically in respect of the euro."
"The amount of fraud in non-cash transactions is growing fast."
"Payment card fraud accounts for around ECU 2.7 billion in losses a year."
"At the same time the legal authorities in the Member States are able to combat these types of crime only semi-effectively simply because there are no laws on the matter."
"The aim of the Commission's proposal is to correct this situation."
"It calls for joint action to ensure that all fraud in non-cash transactions is looked on as a punishable offence in all EU Member States."
"Mr Schmid's report opposes the inclusion in the proposal of provisions on money laundering and mutual assistance."
"He believes that satisfactory results will be achieved in these important areas only through horizontal regulation covering all forms of crime."
"The Commission agrees, but as, unfortunately, there is not yet enough of this sort of regulation, legislation needs to be created jointly."
"The Commission cautiously supports all the proposals for action put forward by Mr Schmid and the other agencies concerned and will take them into consideration in future planning."
"The other subject covered in Mr Schmid's report is protecting the euro from counterfeiting activity."
"This is an important matter that needs to be addressed urgently."
"We expect the euro to be legal tender internationally."
"That being the case, it may well fall prey to internationally organised crime."
"The Commission thus believes that before the euro is allowed to circulate we must devise an effective system to prevent the manufacture of counterfeit euros."
"The Ecofin Council has itself emphasised that an effective protection mechanism must be in place for the new currency before its introduction."
"Ecofin also stressed the role of Europol here and urged the Commission to continue with its initiative."
"The main protection targets will be set out in a Commission communication to be issued in July, reflecting the Commission's views."
"It will focus on the following: education, information, communications systems and databases, cooperation and mutual assistance in investigations, defining what constitutes criminal counterfeiting activity and the introduction of penalties that will act as a deterrent."
"The Commission believes that the institutions concerned each have their own job to do: the European Central Bank, Europol, the Commission, especially in its capacity as the initiator of legislation, the Member States, their central banks, their police forces and their courts."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words about Europol."
"Much has been spoken about how the workload should be divided between Europol on the one hand, and the European Central Bank and the Commission on the other."
"Each will have its own job to do in any future system."
"The sole guiding principle in making decisions will be how effectively we can protect the euro."
"As we know, difficult compromises had to be reached before the Europol Treaty was introduced, relating to the delicate issue of cooperation in matters of crime and punishment when it comes to combating international crime, as these issues are regarded as too tightly bound up with the notion of national sovereignty."
"The protection of the euro will be the responsibility of both the Community and the Member States, however."
"For that reason, we need a properly functioning legislative framework, which might go further than the Europol Treaty."
"Until then we must give Europol the necessary authority to act to prevent counterfeiting activity in respect of the euro within the limits of its present powers."
"I would once more like to thank the rapporteurs for their thorough work."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Safer use of Internet"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0377/98), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council (C4-0535/98-97/0337(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a Multiannual Community Action Plan on promoting safer use of the Internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks (Rapporteur: Mr Schmid)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a saying that goes: 'knowledge is power'."
"If that is true, then we are currently witnessing a shift in power from those who have to some extent enjoyed a monopoly to the many people who have gained access to unheard-of power through the Internet."
"The Internet offers an enormous opportunity."
"But we also know that it involves risks."
"The Internet contains content that can be either unwanted or criminal."
"So the Commission was right to propose a programme to deal with this problem."
"We approved the core of this programme at first reading, but tabled some amendments."
"Most but not all of these amendments were accepted."
"Our committee is therefore retabling some of the amendments from the first reading."
"Basically they can be divided into two groups. The first groups is addressed to the Commission, and concerns the implementation of the programme or things that we do not necessarily have to incorporate in a legal text, but which the Commission can ensure are done."
"Firstly, these are actions to prevent the Internet from being misused any longer for trafficking in women or children."
"Secondly, and in particular, we want preparatory studies to be carried out with a view to making it clear to all concerned what is needed in the way of harmonisation of legislation."
"This is important, because any criminal prosecution, for child pornography for instance, is in fact bound to fail so long as we have different age limits for the protection of children, so long as a server can be operated anonymously, or e-mail sent anonymously."
"If the Commission makes a satisfactory statement on implementation during this debate, I can withdraw Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 6, with the committee's approval."
"That depends on what Mr Liikanen tells us in a moment."
"So I would ask the President to allow me to speak again briefly at the end of the debate, in response to the Commissioner."
"The other group of amendments is addressed to the Council."
"Here we have managed, in cooperation with the Austrian Presidency, to find some compromise formulas which both we and the Council can endorse."
"Firstly, they concern the idea of a quality label for Internet service providers who voluntarily adhere to a code of conduct agreed within the sector."
"That will make it easier for parents to decide which Internet provider's services to use."
"The other concern was to use as little paper as possible for the awareness actions and, wherever possible, to opt for cheaper electronic information."
"As I said, we have reached compromises with the Council."
"This means that we are withdrawing Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 in favour of Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10, which we have tabled as compromise amendments in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"There are other amendments, which I reject without exception, because if we were to accept them we would have to go into a conciliation procedure."
"By handling the matter as we have so far, namely reaching agreement with the Commission and the Council, we avoid the conciliation procedure and save about three months of time."
"For that reason alone, I would advise against accepting the other amendments, from No 12 onwards."
"Furthermore, the importance and quality of these amendments is not such that not accepting them would significantly harm the programme."
"I am pleased that we have made such progress with this action plan, and I would like to compliment the rapporteur on what is an excellent report."
"The Internet is first and foremost a wonderful invention, which breaks down boundaries and opens doors on a scale we could not possibly have imagined only ten years ago."
"In this sense, the Internet is part of a revolution which enables us to communicate with people throughout the world."
"However, if the Internet is organised in an anarchical way, it also means that dishonest and criminal individuals will more or less have a free hand to disseminate illegal images or text, for example child pornography or incitements to racism."
"This is very difficult to stamp out, as we all know, and I am glad that we are proceeding with this European action plan, which can try to prevent the spread of illegal material."
"Users of the Internet will have full control and be able to filter out this kind of material automatically, and so there should be complete transparency."
"However, it is very important for us to distinguish between what is illegal and what is offensive or morally damaging."
"Who is to decide what is damaging, and whose morals are the best?"
"The great thing about the Internet is precisely that there is no censor in the middle of it."
"In the opinion of the Danish Social Democrats, therefore, we should not have a quality label, awarded by the Commission."
"The Commission should not have a monopoly on deciding what is morally correct."
"Nor should we be harmonising civil law in the Member States, but rather working and cooperating to combat such things as child pornography."
"This is illegal in all the Member States, and we can all agree that it is damaging to children's rights."
"So let us begin a joint action to combat child pornography as soon as possible and extend the competence of Europol, so that we can combat international networks which produce, sell and distribute pornographic material of this kind."
"Mr President, the Internet was virtually unknown a few years ago."
"Now, nearly all of us make use of it every day."
"Wherever in the world we happen to be, there is a good chance that we will be able to follow the news and keep ourselves up to date."
"In this sense, the Internet is bad for dictatorships and good for democracy."
"Many of us connected to 'Sarajevo on-line' at a time when that city was otherwise cut off from the world."
"This might sound exaggerated, but I believe that the Internet will one day go down in history books alongside Gutenberg's printing press."
"As to the specific proposals in the report, I am in favour of websites which offer information and assistance on unlawful material coming over the Internet."
"I particularly support the idea of self-regulation for service providers."
"I myself suggested a system of quality labelling to reward those who observe the sector's code of conduct, and I hope that the Commission will go along with this."
"There appeared to be some reticence in the beginning, but I sense that both the Commission and the Council have now been won over."
"Let us hope that we will reach an accommodation on this issue."
"Since we are dealing with an international problem, I remain convinced that effective self-regulation is the best way of achieving sustainable results."
"It must be possible both to offer the necessary safeguards regarding personal integrity and to halt the spread of unlawful or damaging material."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Schmid on his fine report."
"It has been a pleasure to work with him, and he deserves praise for the excellent results he has achieved."
"Mr President, it is a pity that the Council of Ministers is not present to hear me say how much I deplore the decision not to accept the proposal on judicial cooperation."
"I would encourage the Commission to pursue the matter and exploit the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I also have high expectations of the fifth RTD framework programme, which we have often discussed here."
"Many important proposals are likely to be forthcoming as regards safe use of the Internet. This is only right and proper if people are to have faith in the system."
"Copyright too will need protecting. And coordination between this action plan and other measures is vital."
"We are confronted by a twofold problem. Individuals want to know that it is safe for them to pay their bills via the Internet, to send messages and so on."
"Equally, society has a duty to intervene where necessary."
"The first step is to win people's confidence by ensuring that the Internet is safe."
"The Commission could do a great deal to facilitate the use of encryption."
"One Member State actually prevents the unfettered sale and use of encryption services. The US is also putting obstacles in the way of trade."
"Action by the Commission is particularly necessary if the Internet is to become safe to use."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no surprise here."
"We are witnessing how a great invention such as the Internet is growing."
"There is an increase in the number of people using it and in the attempts to control and censor this brilliant invention, and Mr Schmid, our rapporteur, is acting as their spokesman."
"My group will oppose this report because it is not by claiming to defend groups that are particularly vulnerable - we have mentioned here the victims of paedophiles and victims of drugs - that we are going to tackle these problems."
"We know very well that the problem of drugs can be tackled by giving the State the opportunity to regulate and legalise this phenomenon."
"We also know very well that paedophile rings - rings that the judicial authorities in many countries, including Belgium, are failing to clamp down on - do not work via the Internet, and we are attacking something that has nothing or very little to do with these crimes."
"I therefore believe that we must look at the problems facing us and begin to tackle the real issues."
"Mr President, in an earlier life I was chairman of a film censorship committee in Manchester."
"In my time on that committee I never voted to censor a single film."
"I am in favour of minimal censorship but not of none."
"Certain material needs to be kept out of the hands of children; certain material needs labelling so that those who, if you want, investigate it know what they are getting."
"Certain material - paedophile material, pornographic material of certain kinds, particularly snuff movies, and certain racist material - should be banned."
"If it is illegal in written form, it should be illegal on the Internet."
"I know the librarian argument: a librarian does not know what is in every book."
"The same should be true of service providers on the Internet."
"I also want to say that STOA conducted a study recently on the subject of whether material on the Internet can be controlled technically."
"Slightly to our surprise, as a member of the STOA panel, there seemed to be good technical means for controlling what is on the Internet, for example, pornography, so that you can signal areas which you need to investigate and look up."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vast increase in the use of the Internet is prompting outpourings from many opinion-leaders which are comparable to the reactions 500 years ago in response to the advent of printing."
"Then too there were claims that this new technology would sow confusion among the more vulnerable souls and undermine established values and practices."
"It is to the credit of the Commissioner, the Council and Parliament that the multiannual action plan for safer use of the Internet is based more on information, increasing awareness, self-regulation and voluntary codes of behaviour than on repression and censorship."
"The Union has not yet given way to what is said to be a Marxist principle - but I leave that to those who say it - which claims that trust is good, but control is a lot better."
"That said, I am not so naive as to believe that this is the reason why the Council has omitted any reference to cooperation in the field of justice and prosecution."
"This omission indicates that it is mainly with words that the governments of the Member States are urging a joint approach to combating cross-border crime, while shrinking from even considering such cooperation in practice."
"Simply calling with words for more security, while refusing to prepare the necessary action, let alone actually taking it, will only increase the sense of insecurity and threat among our citizens."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is ultimately very damaging to democracy."
"Mr President, Parliament has expressed the wish for changes to the common position."
"The Commission has no difficulty with the substance of most of these amendments."
"In order to be consistent with its position on first reading and its original proposal, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 13."
"The Commission can accept the remaining nine amendments."
"However, time is now of the essence."
"I urge Parliament to consider carefully the proposed amendments so that delays that would occur in the conciliation procedure can be avoided."
"There is little doubt that there is overwhelming support for the action plan; there is no substantial disagreement that should prevent the action plan from being adopted without further delay."
"In three cases - Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 6 - the Commission proposes dealing with Parliament's concern by making the following declaration: 'Liability of intermediaries for Internet content will be dealt with in the proposal for the directive on certain legal questions relating to electronic commerce which the Commission has undertaken to bring forward."
"Counteracting violence and the abuse of women and children is covered by the Daphne programme."
"The Commission will ensure that due account is taken of Parliament's concerns in implementing action lines 1 and 3 with respect to violence and the abuse of women and children on the Internet."
"As a follow-up to the crime study and in conjunction with the forthcoming Commission communication on computer crime, the Commission will arrange for studies on the issues of substantive provisions of criminal law, referred to in Amendment No 6 by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, subject to the availability of budgetary appropriations and to obtaining the necessary approval under the Financial Regulations.'"
"I hope that this will enable an agreed text to be voted and so allow the action plan to be implemented as soon as possible."
"In the light of the sad evidence this summer, with child pornography on the Internet receiving much attention, everybody agrees that there is an urgent need to act."
"Adoption now is vital if the European Union is to maintain its lead in dealing with illegal and harmful content on the Internet."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, for his very constructive approach to the proposals contained in the action plan."
"Mr President, following the Commission's statement, I am authorised by the committee to withdraw Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 6."
"They are redundant."
"Let me point out again that we are withdrawing Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 in favour of the compromise wording of the Council's Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10."
"I should like to make another formal comment. There is an Amendment No 7 which concerns the entry into force of the programme by 1 January next year, since the date of 1 January this year is now obsolete."
"That obsolete date is repeated elsewhere in the programme, so the amendment obviously applies there as well."
"Thank you, Mr Schmid."
"Your explanations will be taken into account tomorrow during the vote."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Clinical trials"
"The next item is the report (A4-0407/98) by Mr Amadeo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use (COM(97)0369 - C4-0446/97-97/0197(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a long-awaited directive is coming before the House today; it is a very important one because of its implications for the use of medicinal products, and therefore because of the substantial health benefits to be gained by citizens and patients in Europe."
"It may seem surprising that, at a time which I would describe as a significant one in the life of the European Parliament, a nonattached Member is presenting a report."
"I consider this to be a most noteworthy sign of the democratic, respectful and impartial nature of this Parliament, and I am grateful to all my fellow members of the Environment Committee, in particular its chairman Mr Collins, and to the coordinators of the political groups: they not only allowed me to draw up this report, but pulled out all the stops to improve its content through a series of well-considered, sincere and truly valuable amendments."
"It is now my duty to report to the House on the background to this presentation in the plenary and on the content of the directive."
"I shall comment first of all on the working method."
"Having noted immediately the importance of and expectations concerning the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, I considered that my task should mainly be one of meticulously and objectively coordinating a series of proposals from experts in the field. I therefore held a number of meetings with European consumer groups and associations, patients' groups of different nationalities, representatives of ethics committees in various countries, independent voluntary bodies, groups of university and hospital researchers, and European representatives of drugs companies."
"At the same time, I took on board the views of all those - individuals or groups - who approached me either in person or in writing with particular comments and considerations. In short, in the explanatory statement and the amendments, I have attempted to summarise all the different opinions I have heard, so as to bring to bear the greatest possible measure of democratic spirit, openness and active participation on a proposal which must not be handed down from above, but rather should be the fruit of concerted action on the part of everyone."
"The basic aim was as follows. The adoption of this directive could give a major boost to the long-standing eager expectations of the Union's scientific community, provided that it really does bring about harmonisation."
"In other words, all 390 million European citizens, exercising the same rights and duties, should be in a position to benefit from the outcome of clinical trials on human subjects."
"It is likewise imperative that research institutes as a whole, whether public or private, in all 15 Member States should enjoy equal opportunities and compete with one another on proper terms."
"At present, the guidelines on good clinical practice are intended purely for information and not enforced in the same way in individual Member States, which are responsible for legislative regulation."
"Our task is to convert the principles and guidelines into a binding Community legislative act to regulate an activity now largely carried on at trial sites, often operating in different Member States."
"My first remark is that the directive contains proposals relating to the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products on human subjects and the implementation of GCP."
"This text acknowledges the need to harmonise within the Community the administrative procedures and documents used, especially in multi-centre trials."
"Its stated aim is to rationalise the administrative procedures required for the launch of a clinical trial, thus making Europe more competitive as compared, for example, to the United States, whilst maintaining a high level of protection for trial subjects."
"Secondly, it is necessary in our opinion to provide a simple, unambiguous legislative frame of reference for European clinical research."
"Europe should improve its ability to supply clinical data needed to develop and register pharmaceutical preparations, for instance by stipulating that replies and documents requested must be produced within standard time limits, thus enabling trials to be conducted in several countries at once."
"Rapid access to clinical trials, however regulated, is ethically beneficial to the extent that it allows patients, especially those suffering from serious diseases, to be treated at an early stage."
"Moreover, trials are scientifically beneficial, since the researchers involved can publish and discuss the findings of their experiments and in that way further their careers."
"Lastly, clinical trials are economically beneficial because they can attract substantial corporate investment which can also be used to fund basic research in the centres concerned."
"Thirdly, the technical aspects of the proposed directive must be harmonised with documents already issued or currently being drawn up, and in particular those relating to the ICH, those on GCP and those on pharmacovigilance."
"Fourthly, one particular weakness in the current proposal for a directive is its provision for two possible procedures, one based on authorisation and the other on notification."
"After lengthy deliberations, we resolved that harmonisation must be based on one procedure only, and the Environment Committee expressed this view when voting on the amendments."
"In our opinion, when an application for authorisation is submitted to the ethics committee, the regulatory authority should merely be notified and would then have 30 days in which to raise objections, should it think fit."
"Under that procedure, patients would be doubly protected - by the ethics committee and because the regulatory authority would have the option of intervening - but clear-cut and brief time limits would be laid down, and time is, at present, the most decisive factor where clinical trials in Europe are concerned."
"All countries must make the same undertaking: to harmonise - that is, to determine a single procedure based on the system of notification."
"Such a procedure would ensure, firstly, scrupulous protection for patients, in that GCP rules must be complied with, the green light must be obtained from the ethics committee and the Member States may put forward any reasoned objections within the 30-day period; secondly, certainty as to the starting date of the trials; and, thirdly, uniform procedures in all the Member States."
"In conclusion, our task as the European Parliament goes beyond single market and competition issues, and encompasses a human dimension that should be a matter of particular concern to us all."
"It is to be hoped that Parliament will manage to provide the democratic impetus to persuade the Commission and Council to lay down a single clear-cut rule for all the Member States."
"I have one brief final point, Mr President."
"Amendments Nos 29 and 30 have been resubmitted so as to ensure that trials can also take place in centres engaged in research other than for the registration of medicinal products."
"Amendment No 14 should, in my opinion, be put to the vote after No 31, which is more comprehensive and which, if adopted, will cause No 14 to fall."
"Amendment No 35 should be put to the vote before No 16 because, if adopted, it will cause the last paragraph of No 16 and the whole of No 17 to fall."
"Thank you, Mr Amadeo."
"Since you were so courteous, at the beginning, as to thank all the groups for having permitted you to draw up this report, I allowed you three or four brief points at the end, and not just the one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the approximation of these provisions, we must pursue two aims."
"The first is to ensure the protection of the patient, which is the prime concern of good clinical practice."
"To that end, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy has called for it to be made absolutely plain in the wording of the directive that an investigator means a doctor and not, as proposed by the Commission, a person responsible."
"Another means of improving patient protection is to ensure that resources allocated to pharmaceutical research are not squandered on obsolete trials or trials also carried out at another site."
"If the standards established through good clinical practice are observed, we shall be able to avoid that kind of duplication."
"The second point is that we must bear in mind the interests of the pharmaceutical industry which is conducting the clinical trials."
"These trials are essential to bringing new medical products on to the market."
"The extent to which the pharmaceutical industry can be innovative depends largely on the efficiency of the administrative procedures that have to be gone through before trials can be conducted."
"The Commission has taken a major step towards tightening up these administrative procedures by obliging the authorising authorities to decide within 30 days whether or not a clinical trial may be conducted."
"In some Member States, such as Germany, it has already been shown that it is quite possible for the authorities to take an informed decision within that period."
"The procedures have been tightened further by allowing the decision on the conduct of certain clinical trials to be based purely on a notification procedure."
"Another important aspect is that the directive approximates good clinical practice rules with the guidelines laid down by the International Conference on Harmonisation, because clinical trials conducted in Europe must not be subject to stricter requirements than those carried out in the rest of the world."
"At the same time, however, they must comply with international requirements in this field."
"That is what we proposed, and I warmly thank Mr Amadeo for his report."
"Mr President, I want to welcome the Commission proposal this evening and to recognise the work done by Mr Amadeo in producing a very well thought-out report."
"He has been very courteous to the other groups tonight and we can all say that we appreciate the time he has taken and the strenuous efforts he has made to find a compromise in certain particularly difficult areas of this report."
"I would like to emphasise that European legislation on clinical trials has to be in line with international guidelines as laid down in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines."
"This is something that should be included in the directive in order to ensure harmonisation."
"The report is a very important one which aims to reduce the amount of bureaucracy surrounding the conduct and application procedure of clinical trials while, at the same time, ensuring that the health, safety and confidentiality of clinical trials subjects are of utmost priority."
"The issue of timescales of the application procedure has proved a problematic factor in the discussions on this issue and it has been of some concern particularly among the pharmaceutical industries."
"We have looked at this further in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and it is especially of concern in the case of multicentre trials where administrative procedures can lead to extensive delays and confusion even before the commencement of the trial."
"Some rationalisation has therefore been achieved in this report to ensure that multicentre trials, especially those covering a number of EU Member States, are using the same information and products of the same high quality."
"In committee we agreed that the procedure for applying to conduct a clinical trial had to be looked into very closely."
"At present companies or researchers may commence with a clinical trial without an obligation to notify."
"Between the systems of authorisation and notification we favour the system of notification because with this system, when an application is submitted to the Ethics Committee, the regulatory authority will be notified, and the investigator may commence with the trial thereby cutting the bureaucracy to a minimum."
"Moreover, the Ethics Committee would have the possibility of raising its concerns and the investigator would have to act on those concerns."
"I also welcome the rapporteur's views on the role of ethics committees and agree that the safety and dignity of patients must remain the utmost priority."
"The introduction of ethics committees under EU law seeks to ensure the safety of subjects in such trials."
"When red tape is reduced and the safety of trial subjects is ensured, particularly through the involvement of ethics committees, EU citizens can benefit from exciting new drugs and discoveries and innovative medicinal products that result from efficiently conducted clinical trials carried out in a more timely manner than hitherto."
"Finally, I thank the rapporteur for the commitment he has shown in drafting a highly appropriate report, and I look forward to a positive response from the Commission."
"Mr President, we feel that the Commission's proposal is sound and one we can accept and support."
"Nevertheless, quite a number of amendments were tabled in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, where all the political groups worked closely together."
"I support my colleague Mr Needle's statement, which proves that the work in committee was fruitful and that we come to the House with a widely accepted position."
"Nevertheless, too many amendments were adopted in committee, as has tended to be the case of late. Some of these amendments are not entirely appropriate and it does not seem very likely that they could be incorporated into a coherent text."
"That is why we need to repeat Amendment No 31, which does not change what was adopted in committee but makes it easier to understand and enhances the legal certainty of the wording."
"I also believe it is important to repeat here in the House and for the benefit of the sector and the patients themselves, that the work would be facilitated and the trials harmonised with a fairly efficient system. Its key features are the mere notification of the start of the clinical trial, a time limit of 30 days and a single ethics committee."
"Speed and legal certainty will be gained. Finally, there will be adequate safeguards for the fundamental rights of individuals, which has been one of our main concerns since the beginning."
"In addition, the proposal will result in a text that is in line with international regulations, which was another of the goals we set ourselves."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the work which he has done in committee, and I welcome the broad support for this proposal."
"The proposal codifies the Helsinki declaration while allowing the Member States to go further in terms of strengthening the protection of patients, which is also a focus of the committee's amendments."
"There are three main problems which may be a cause of division."
"Firstly, there is the question of whether the Member States should authorise a clinical trial when the ethics committee has said yes, or if authorisation can be withheld in some cases."
"Secondly, there is the question of whether authorisation is obtained automatically when an application has been made and no answer has been received, or if notification actually has to be given before proceeding with clinical trials, regardless of the fact that nothing has been heard from the official authorities."
"And thirdly, there are the time limits which are to apply to the work of the ethics committee."
"I would firstly like to say that the Liberal Group supports the main thrust of the amendments, but I personally have some reservations about the three points I have mentioned."
"I think it is extremely important to preserve the Member States' ability to reject an application, even if the ethics committee has said yes."
"I do not in fact see this as a major problem in practice, because the ethics committee will not normally be operating in a political vacuum."
"As regards the question of whether it is possible to proceed automatically, or if notification has to be given or a positive authorisation obtained, I would emphasise that I think this is also important in terms of patient protection."
"I do not agree with the amendments concerning time limits."
"Experience with the present ethics committees shows that ethical considerations and decisions take time, and so we should not set too short a time limit for the ethics committee to do its work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rules on conducting clinical trials are to apply from now on to socalled 'multi-centre' trials, that is, trials that apply the same protocol in 50 or 60 different investigational sites, thereby ensuring that between 2 000 and 3 000 patients are used at a total cost of between ECU 300 million and ECU 500 m for one single trial."
"That goes to show that when the human, social and economic resources of these trials, which are aimed at developing new medicinal products, are better targeted, they are therefore more effective and better tolerated by patients."
"Besides having to notify the relevant local authorities of the trial, or using a centralised procedure through the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, a certain number of rules must be respected, and they were the subject of amendments in committee."
"These amendments, which are supported by the UPE Group, have various objectives."
"Firstly, they aim to guarantee full and objective information for the patients likely to take part in the trial."
"Secondly, they are aimed at ensuring that the participants give their consent voluntarily by means of a written document that must be dated and signed, and, as a result, the necessary arrangements must be made for the mentally handicapped."
"Thirdly, they aim to obtain the opinions of multidisciplinary and independent ethics committees, that is, committees consisting of doctors and paramedical staff that are not directly involved in the clinical trial."
"Fourthly, they hope to oblige the Member States to take the necessary measures to respect good manufacturing practices with a view to guaranteeing the quality and safety of medicinal products."
"And fifthly, they aim to make third countries exporting to the European Union provide proof that quality control and batch approval have been carried out, so that the products can actually be traced if something happens."
"Notification must, of course, be given of any undesirable and serious occurrence in a Member State where the trial is taking place."
"Finally, the researchers must be qualified doctors, who are responsible for the trial and, therefore, capable of assessing whether it is running smoothly and the effects on the patients voluntarily taking part in the study."
"We are in favour of the proposal for a directive as amended, which aims to establish a framework designed to promote efficient clinical research to the benefit of patients."
"Mr President, Mr Amadeo's report is extremely interesting, and is indeed improved in certain respects by some of the amendments."
"I think, however, that there should have been more criticism of the loopholes and omissions in the Commission's proposal, and that we should be more daring about more specific proposals and more advanced measures for carrying out checks, both preventive and repressive, and imposing sanctions as and when criminal intentions are exposed that stem from profiteering by the all-powerful multinational pharmaceutical groups."
"This is because those groups, involved as they are with other interests too - even political interests, as we all know - use and exploit a whole range of people without any accountability at all, for example people suffering from incurable diseases, people committed to psychiatric clinics or similar institutions because of psychiatric disorders, or people whose freedoms are restricted - I am talking about prison inmates who become experimental animals without their consent so that new drugs can be clinically tested."
"Such people must of course be protected, but we must not forget that declarations alone do not suffice for their protection. For this, there must be specific measures, which are unfortunately missing from the Commission's proposal."
"Unfortunately, despite the amendments, the Amadeo report does not criticise those omissions and does nothing to make them good."
"It amazes me that payments and compensation are provided for; payments for those who undergo trials and compensation for those whose physical or mental health is damaged in trials of new drugs."
"In other words, the human body and mind have become a commodity."
"Here we see the prevalence of the law, the taboo of free competition, the right of industrial ownership, the prevalence of lack of transparency in programmes, research and funding."
"With the opportunity this report gives us, we must overcome these things so that clinical trials of new drugs for diseases will be beneficial for the health of mankind..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on the need to protect patients - and many here have spoken of a high level of protection; but I too feel that the level of patient protection should be defined in far more specific terms."
"I too am concerned with defining this high level of protection."
"It is not enough for us to say: someone else has to give consent for those who are incapable of giving their informed consent."
"No!"
"That is why we have tabled an amendment which provides quite plainly that no research may be carried out on people who are incapable of giving their informed consent unless it is of direct use."
"This is a crucial point, because what would happen in the reverse case?"
"If we do not endorse this amendment, then that would surely automatically mean that anyone at all can consent on behalf of these people who are incapable of giving their informed consent, and that research can be carried out on them which is of no use at all."
"Then we really will be treating people to whom we have promised a high level of protection just like guinea pigs."
"In my view, we must not forget either that we are running a risk of opening the door to eugenics, unless we guarantee a direct level of protection."
"The past has after all proved that we must not carry out research on the mentally handicapped who are incapable of giving their consent, unless it is of direct use."
"So I would very urgently ask you to support this amendment by the Green Group, so that we can ensure precisely that."
"Let me also place special emphasis on this aspect against the background of the heated discussions we have already seen here in the European Parliament, and especially also among many social groups, concerning the bioethics convention."
"The Federal Republic has not signed this bioethics convention, for precisely the reasons I have just given."
"That is why our prime concern should be that we do not approve a directive which does not specifically guarantee protection for people who are incapable of giving their informed consent."
"I would therefore ask the House to endorse our amendment, which makes it clear that research may only be conducted if it is of direct use, and that any other research is quite out of the question."
"Mr President, everyone knows that since 1990 the rules governing clinical trials in the European Union, and internationally, have been codified in directives on good clinical practice. The globalisation of the pharmaceuticals industry has necessarily led to the harmonisation of international rules set at the International Conference on Harmonisation."
"Nonetheless, the Member States can still take different legislative or administrative measures, and that can lead to significant delays in starting clinical trials. This, in turn, is bound to lead to delays in the application of the benefits of those trials to the treatment of patients."
"That is why, without prejudice to the principle of subsidiarity, we need to take decisive steps towards rationalising and harmonising clinical trials."
"Nonetheless, while scientific research has to be supported and encouraged, we must also ensure that those who take part in the trials are guaranteed protection, so that their human rights and dignity are respected."
"That is why it is important to have ethics committees and for them to be transparent and independent."
"If there were one national ethics committee, coordinating the regional and local committees, then each Member State could have a single set of rules while safeguarding the independence of local committees and allowing them to agree to or ban trials."
"There would also have to be an ethics committee, whose opinions would be binding, at every centre where clinical trials take place."
"Those opinions would be issued by doctors not involved in the trials, along with nurses and other health professionals, as well as non-medical staff, to guarantee patients' safety and the wellbeing of those taking part."
"Researchers, whether medical or not - and if not then medical supervision should be provided - ought invariably to obtain the informed consent of everyone taking part in trials - or of their guardians - and honour their confidentiality."
"We could then promote research, safeguarding the interests of patients and of the pharmaceuticals industry alike."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to the rapporteur."
"Two thirds of all diseases can still not be treated or treated adequately."
"Some of them are quite dreadful diseases, and often fatal."
"Hence the need for medical research, and especially research into medical products."
"The directive we are discussing can help improve clinical research in Europe."
"In particular, the standardisation of procedures offers a chance to avoid duplication."
"However, we must guarantee comprehensive protection of the trial subjects under all circumstances."
"Special attention must be given to protecting people who are incapable of giving their informed consent, such as children and the mentally handicapped."
"The Commission proposal does not take adequate account of this."
"Instead, it refers mainly to the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of human rights and biomedicine."
"But that convention is a subject of dispute, and some Member States have not yet decided whether or not to ratify it."
"The European Commission - and I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to pass this on - should stop writing this convention into EU legislative documents, rather on the assumption that 'we need not concern ourselves with the ethical questions; the Council of Europe has already done so'."
"We need very strict provisions to protect individuals who are incapable of giving their informed consent."
"Under no circumstances may children or the mentally handicapped be misused as guinea pigs."
"However, I do not accept Mr Ephremidis's statement as it stands, since I believe that the overwhelming majority of responsible persons in industry and in the clinics do not carry out research in an abusive manner, but abide by the rules on the protection of trial subjects."
"But we must also make that clear under this directive."
"I do not endorse the amendment by the Green Group to the effect that people who are incapable of giving their informed consent should be totally excluded from the research, because I believe we would then be bringing research to a standstill, for children's diseases in particular."
"Some children's diseases do not occur among adults, which is why it is not possible to conduct the relevant studies in full on adults."
"That is why we need strict rules, but not a total ban."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by thanking Mr Amadeo for his excellent work and outstanding readiness to cooperate with all members of the committee, as well as for taking up so many amendments and being so open to suggestions."
"This proposal for a directive is of particular importance because it sets out to regulate such a sensitive sector, seeking to harmonise standards for the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products on human subjects."
"The good clinical practice guide has existed since 1990, but as we all know is not binding; that is why national provisions must be harmonised."
"It is advisable to lay down a single procedure in a field where the rules currently vary from one Member State to another."
"We have opted for notification rather than authorisation, and the reasons why have been explained."
"But what is even more vital is to protect the health of subjects who volunteer for trials."
"To this end, an amendment submitted by me and adopted unanimously by my colleagues in the Environment Committee provides for an explicit definition of informed consent: before taking part in a clinical trial, the subject of that trial must receive full and easily understandable information about the trial, and must sign a written statement indicating consent."
"Ethics committees play a particularly important role in protecting subjects who volunteer for trials: it will be they who evaluate the relevance of the trial, the protocol, the suitability of the investigators and the available facilities."
"Ethics committees will assess the adequacy and completeness of the written information."
"In the case of injury, the sponsors and the ethics committee should be informed immediately."
"In this way, we shall ensure that trials are completely safe."
"The Member States will furthermore be cooperating with one another in the interests of research by the European pharmaceutical industry and, ultimately, the health of their citizens, who will receive early treatment with the new products."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Liese, I too wish to emphasise once again that despite the undoubted success in curing illnesses by the use of medicines, there are still at present some 20 000 diseases that we cannot treat with much hope of success."
"That is why new, effective and safe medicines will still be essential in the future."
"Clinical trials, in other words studies of the potential effects of a medicine on human beings, are extremely important to medical research and development."
"Various speakers have referred to the need for international networking."
"We consider it urgently necessary not just to take joint action on a Europe-wide basis, but to have international agreements."
"That is why Mr Valverde and I have tabled three amendments, to emphasise that point again."
"This is all the more important because - as has already been said - all these safety requirements also concern the protection of human beings, and in particular the protection of people who are incapable or less capable of giving their informed consent."
"Our group aims to ensure that human beings are comprehensively protected in the conduct of clinical trials, that all patients have access to therapeutic progress, but also that we have and maintain reliable and innovative framework conditions for research and for the development and production of innovative medicines."
"Mr Amadeo has done some valuable work towards achieving these aims, and we can basically support his report."
"Mr President, the characteristics we demand from pharmaceutical products are quality, safety and efficacy."
"The most important information regarding those characteristics comes from clinical trials in man."
"I believe it is quite clear to us all that such trials must be carried out in accordance with firm and inviolate rules which go as far as possible towards protecting the physical and mental integrity of those who take part in them, and at the same time provide air-tight guarantees of the inviolability of their private life."
"Most of the amendments the European Parliament will be voting on go some way towards strengthening the Commission's text in relation to the safeguarding, if I can use this expression, of the human experimental animals used in clinical trials, with detailed provisions ranging from full information for participants about the clinical trial and their written consent, to restoration and compensation in the event of damage or death."
"I would like to believe that the Commission will accept all these amendments."
"We must not forget that we owe a lot to the volunteer subjects who undergo clinical trials, because it is thanks to them that the final assessment can be made, particularly of a drug's safety and efficacy, with records of any side effects it may have."
"This has benefited mankind in the past, and it is still a benefit and will remain so in the future, thanks to valuable drugs that protect human health and provide means of restoring it when it fails."
"Finally, Mr President, it is self-evident that the provisions of this directive must be implemented in a uniform manner in all the Member States if we really want to ensure proper clinical trials and fair competition in the production and marketing of drugs."
"Here, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Amadeo, who worked so well with the Committee on the Environment."
"Mr President, Parliament has recommended some thirty amendments to the proposal for a directive."
"The Commission accepts half of them, as they either complement the Commission's original proposal satisfactorily or they simplify it."
"The Commission unreservedly accepts seven amendments."
"In addition, we can accept two amendments if we alter the wording slightly."
"The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1 and 6, paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of Amendment No 10, and Amendments Nos 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 27."
"The Commission will take the following into consideration in its amended proposal."
"The Commission intends to include in its proposal Amendments Nos 1 and 6 and paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of Amendment No 10."
"The amendments serve to improve the degree of protection afforded to participants in clinical trials in particular by imposing the condition of informed consent and the protection of the sponsor in Amendment No 19."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament's competent committees that we need to confirm the status of the ethics committee as the recipient of certain types of information especially with regard to medical safety during a clinical trial, as well as the tasks connected with undertaking the clinical trial itself. The trial could last as long as five to ten years."
"This concerns Amendments Nos 21, 22 and 27."
"The most major amendment put forward by Parliament's competent committees concerns deleting the reference to alternative commencement procedures."
"In the Commission's original proposal the alternatives were either to notify the competent authorities, which is the normal legal procedure, or to obtain an official licence issued by the competent authority, which was suggested in consideration of special or exceptional circumstances."
"Parliament's competent committees only support the notification procedure, which is the purpose behind Amendments Nos 13, 14, 15 and 18."
"The Commission accepts this position and will amend its original proposal accordingly."
"In addition, the purpose behind Amendments Nos 23 and 24 is to clarify or specify more precisely the principles of good manufacturing practices applicable to investigational medical products to be used in clinical trials."
"The Commission cannot accept amendments that do not improve on the original as it stands, especially when it comes to the readability of a complicated text."
"This applies to Amendments Nos 3, 8, 9, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Amendment No 12, and Amendments Nos 16, 17, 20, 25 and 26."
"Neither can the Commission accept amendments which dramatically alter the original text, or stray too far way from its spirit or legal basis."
"This is the case with Amendments Nos 4, 7, paragraph 3 of Amendment No 10, and Amendments Nos 11 and 20, and, similarly, Amendments Nos 28 and 36, which reiterate amendments the Commission cannot accept."
"I would further like to emphasise that the Commission is very satisfied with the constructive view taken by the rapporteur and is confident that there will be effective cooperation with the European Parliament so that the statute can be adopted reasonably quickly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, the Dutch taxation authorities tax not only Parliament's contribution to voluntary pensions but also the actual pensions payable."
"I am grateful to Mrs Fontaine for her spontaneous protest at this, and to Mr Rothley for putting down an amendment aimed at ending this anomalous state of affairs in the Netherlands."
"Unfortunately a number of our Dutch people have indicated through their representative that they are happy with the system."
"That is what I wanted recorded in the Minutes yesterday, and I am glad to see that it has been done."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that I was here yesterday but for some inexplicable reason my name does not appear on the list."
"I would be glad if that could be put right."
"We shall check that and include your name."
"Mr President, the same thing happened to me yesterday."
"My name is not on the attendance register either. I must have been so focused on the Rothley report and the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights that I forgot to sign."
"Please could my name be added."
"That will be checked and corrected."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, we have been looking forward to getting the diaries for 1999 and am pleased we were able to collect them yesterday."
"One of the important dates for 1999 is that of the elections to this House."
"As you know, there has been a wide-ranging debate in Parliament about the days on which these elections should be held."
"So I am very disappointed to see it stated incorrectly in this diary that just three countries of the European Union will be voting not on Sunday the thirteenth but earlier, and that my own country, the Netherlands, is not listed with these."
"It is quite wrong that the elections are to be held on Sunday."
"One of the good traditions we have in the Netherlands is that these elections are held during the week, and it is a mistake that the Netherlands is not down as voting on 10 June."
"I should like to ask how you propose to correct this misunderstanding and prevent the turnout from being even lower."
"I believe you should put this question to the Dutch authorities."
"As you are well aware, the date of the elections is not determined by entries in Parliament's agenda but by the authorities in each Member State. The elections must take place within a set time period that may only be altered following a Council decision and Parliament has no power in this respect."
"The particular date set for elections in the Netherlands must have been decided by the authorities in that country, on the grounds, presumably, of the principle of subsidiarity."
"In no way is Parliament responsible for the dates of the elections nor may it change them."
"That is not the point, Mr President."
"The elections will indeed be held in the Netherlands on 10 June."
"That is not the problem."
"It is the diary which is wrong."
"That needs to be corrected."
"That is what Mr van Dam is asking."
"A check will be carried out to establish if an error has been made on our part in the agenda."
"Rest assured, however, that elections in the Netherlands will not be held in accordance with our agenda but in accordance with the arrangements made by the Dutch authorities."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"President."
"I call Mr von Wogau to give the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which is the committee responsible."
"Mr President, this is an issue which we have had to deal with before. This problem referred to by the Commission has existed since January of this year."
"But we did not receive the documents until September."
"I cannot therefore understand why the Commission has now twice in succession lodged a request for urgent procedure when it had plenty of time before."
"Mr Langen is currently preparing a report which we will vote on at the November meeting and present to the House in December."
"I therefore propose that we reject the request for urgent procedure."
"I put the request for urgent procedure to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Court of Auditors annual report"
"The next item is the presentation of the annual report of the Court of Auditors."
"I should like to welcome the President of the Court, Mr Friedmann, who once again has been kind enough to come and present this report to the House."
"Mr Friedmann, you have the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Members of the European Court of Auditors, may I thank you for allowing me to present the results of our work over the past year at this early hour of the morning."
"We will surely agree that money is not everything, but the way in which money is used is an indication of whether a policy is successful or not."
"You will probably have noticed that this year's annual report is much slimmer than in previous years."
"This is not because we have done any less work, quite the contrary."
"In the past year, we have presented 25 special reports."
"Our aim is in fact also to make your own work easier by spreading these annual reports over the year, so that you too can spread your work accordingly."
"I readily admit that there is still room for improvement, but there is good will for this on our part."
"On the revenue side in the past year, the Community has continued to lose billions from both customs duties and value added tax."
"In the case of customs duties, this is partly due to the fact there is still insufficient cooperation between national customs authorities."
"The possibilities of modern information technology are not being adequately exploited."
"Every Member State has its own risk analysis methods, which produce different results."
"The Member States' lack of interest in pursuing this more vigorously is all the more surprising when one considers that uncollected customs revenue has to be offset in the budget by higher contributions from the Member States."
"I would therefore appeal to the Member States to attach greater importance to collecting customs duties correctly, in their own interest."
"In the case of value added tax, as I said, huge amounts are being lost."
"Model calculations have shown that in the years 1991 to 1993 - on a basis of nine Member States - the amount underpaid on average every year was ECU 70 billion."
"It is true that this is happening in the Member States, but it has a direct impact on the European Union."
"We still have the unsatisfactory situation that the country of destination principle applies in the single market, whereby the goods are outside the tax system from the place of origin until they reach their destination, which of course offers tempting opportunities for irregularities."
"On the expenditure side, following the structure of the budget, we have once again concentrated our efforts on agricultural and structural policy."
"On the agricultural policy, we have presented a number of special reports, for example on the BSE disease in cows, and on the closure of accounts."
"In the annual report itself, we tackle the question of durum wheat, amongst other things."
"Why?"
"Because this is a cereal which is particularly heavily subsidised."
"For durum wheat, not only is the normal aid per hectare paid, but an additional aid which is only justifiable in political terms."
"Had the same criteria that apply to other cereals been applied to durum wheat, more than ECU 3 billion in subsidies could have been saved over a four-year period."
"We dealt in a special report with the exports of New Zealand dairy products to the United Kingdom."
"Certain quotas of New Zealand milk and cheese may, in fact, be exported from New Zealand to the United Kingdom on preferential terms, provided that it meets certain criteria, including in particular a specified fat content."
"As we established, the import conditions were not always complied with, leading to a reduction of Community revenue by some ECU 410 million."
"Much of this revenue can no longer be claimed, but around ECU 110 million is still recoverable, and we have called on the Commission to pursue the matter."
"So much for that area of the agricultural policy."
"As you know, the Court is strongly committed to environmental policy."
"It was recently awarded the 'Europäisches Naturerbe ' prize for its work in this area."
"In a special report, we point out that among the 40 000 sewage plants in operation in the EU, some of which have received EU assistance, there are some serious shortcomings."
"A third of the plants in Belgium and as many as half of those in Italy are in need of repair."
"Above all, we established that a good many sewage plants were not even put into service initially, because the operators did not have the money to cover the operating costs or lacked the technical know-how. This is something that must be considered, since between now and the year 2005, a further 40 000 plants are to be constructed."
"We also took a critical look at the support for renewable energy sources under the JOULE-Thermie programme."
"Amongst other things, we established that the Commission had used more than 50 % of the staff posts earmarked for the programme in other areas of expenditure."
"At the same time, we discovered cases where Commission staff involved in management decisions were exposed to major conflicts of interest, in particular because these staff had previously worked elsewhere, something which must be looked at in connection with the placing of orders."
"We all know that, time and again, the European Union is faced with new challenges."
"This is often a difficult task for the Commission, when it is called upon to respond rapidly to heavy demands imposed upon it at short notice."
"Humanitarian aid is one example of this, to which we devoted a special report which appeared in March last year."
"In 1991, it was decided that, for the period 1992 to 1997, some ECU 4 billion would be made available for this purpose."
"More than ECU 3 billion has already been spent."
"The aid has indeed reached the people in need of it."
"The problem lies in the Commission's central unit for managing humanitarian aid, known as ECHO."
"In our special report last year, we had already pointed out that the staff policy regarding outside personnel in particular in this department was not transparent."
"We asked for further information in writing from the Commission."
"This information was not satisfactory."
"You are all only too well aware of the debate which then flared up under the catchword 'U-boats'."
"It is not only with ECHO that there are problems with external staff, however, but also with the PHARE, TACIS and MED programmes, where some of the operating appropriations may be used for programme support, i.e. for outside experts."
"The figure - known as the 'Liikanen facility' after my neighbour here, Commissioner Liikanen - is 2 % for PHARE, 3.5 % for TACIS and 3 % for MED."
"Our initial inquiries have shown that these figures were exceeded by more than twice as much."
"I would ask Parliament to give some critical attention to this matter, so that proper order is restored."
"As you know, the PHARE and TACIS activities also include nuclear safety."
"In the last week, we have adopted a special report on this which has now been published."
"In this report, we have established some significant things."
"It should first be pointed out that, since 1990, the Community has provided some ECU 850 million for nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe."
"To this aid provided by the European Union must be added the further aid which the international community has made available, in particular through the G7 and G24."
"And in addition there are the loans granted by the EBRD in London."
"What complaints do we have?"
"Of the ECU 850 million made available, only ECU 300 million has been spent so far."
"This is an indication that this policy is not being pursued with the necessary determination and rigour."
"We criticise the fact that the G7 and G24 activities are being inadequately coordinated by the Commission."
"The Commission points out that it is not exclusively responsible for this, but it must nevertheless be clear that it has to coordinate these activities."
"We are critical of the fact that the Commission has no definite policy on the decommissioning of older nuclear power plants and the disposal of radioactive waste."
"I think this is a very important point."
"Another criticism is that, of the money provided for technical assistance, about one third, in other words ECU 200 million, was spent directly, i.e. without any open tendering."
"With the best will in the world, it was not possible at the end of last year to form a definite judgement on how the Commission's efforts to improve nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe should be assessed."
"I would appeal urgently to you, as political decision-makers - but also to the Commission and the Council - to devote appropriate attention to this extremely important task, which is ticking away like a time bomb."
"We are now constantly being asked what progress we are making in uncovering fraud involving European funds."
"On this point, I would like to take the precaution of defining our position for you once again."
"We in the Court of Auditors are required to consider whether the principles of legality, regularity and sound financial management are being met."
"This means that we are not a criminal investigation department, nor a police force."
"However, we do pay particular attention to areas of risk which we select using specific criteria."
"In other words, we see our task above all as preventing fraud, helping to ensure that it does not occur, and developing ideas which make fraud unattractive in the first place."
"If we do encounter actual cases of fraud or irregularities in carrying out our normal auditing tasks, we naturally work together with the national criminal investigation authorities - as well as UCLAF - so that matters take their proper course."
"In the field of tourism, for example, we are working with the criminal investigation departments of several countries, and in the case I have just mentioned, the 'New Zealand Dairy Report', we are cooperating with the British authorities, that goes without saying."
"We also audit UCLAF, since UCLAF is also a department of the Commission."
"A few weeks ago, we presented a report on it which met with an appropriate response from you, for which I should like to thank the House."
"Amongst other things, we criticise the fact that the UCLAF databases are incomplete and therefore not fully usable."
"It is not clear who actually has access to these databases, and that is of course a question of security."
"Half the UCLAF employees are on short-term contracts, so that when people have settled in they leave again and important knowledge is lost."
"Because the databases are not fully usable, it is sometimes not possible to recover sums which the Community should be able to recover."
"It is also not clear what powers UCLAF has within the Commission itself, given that it has no powers in other institutions."
"This needs to be clarified by the Commission."
"We have taken careful note that a debate has started here in the House on the subject of OLAF."
"Your aim here is to extend and develop the powers of UCLAF."
"You have also looked at the question of whether a separate institution should be created."
"We have followed all this very carefully, especially since you base some of your arguments on our own report."
"We in the Court of Auditors believe - and here we agree with you - that the Community institutions can of course develop their administration and their organisation further."
"That is in accordance with the Treaties and does not infringe the rights of the Member States, and to that extent we in the Court can imagine that the independence of UCLAF could well be increased if it were to be given a position of independence in the form of OLAF roughly similar to that of the Financial Controller at the Commission."
"But that is your decision!"
"We are of course ready to work with any unit that is created by the legislative authority."
"As you know, the Court of Auditors is repeatedly asked to provide opinions on proposed measures."
"Any institution can ask us to produce a report, especially on measures which affect the budget."
"The latest comprehensive opinion of this kind dealt with Agenda 2000."
"We were asked for such an opinion by the Council."
"In this, of course, we also address the agricultural policy as it is envisaged for the future by the Commission."
"As you know, the Commission is proposing to reduce the guarantee prices for beef by 30 %, for cereals by 20 % and for milk by 10 %."
"My impression is that the Commission drew up these plans at a time when the full extent of the crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America had still not been recognised."
"In the meantime, it has become clear that, because of the crises in these regions, purchasing power for European agricultural products has fallen."
"To prevent surplus stocks being created and the associated export refunds and storage costs, it would be more sensible to cut the guarantee prices more sharply than the Commission has proposed, but as a counter-move to place greater emphasis on direct aid."
"As you know, the Commission is proposing to reduce direct aid above ECU 100 000 by 20 % and above ECU 200 000 by 25 %."
"We would ask whether, in view of the fact that 80 % of the direct aid is paid to 20 % of the agricultural holdings, it would not be more sensible to put a cap on direct aid over ECU 100 000, for example, as we have indicated."
"The Commission has assumed that no direct aid is to be paid to the new Member States which are to join the Union."
"We in the Court of Auditors take the view that this appears unrealistic, and have therefore proposed that, as a precaution, direct aid for the future Member States should be included in the calculations."
"This would mean that ECU 3.3 billion would have to be entered in the budget annually in connection with the future Member States."
"With regard to structural aid, we are largely in agreement with the Commission."
"We think it is right that Community structural assistance should be implemented in more concentrated form."
"We think it right that a 10 % reserve should be created for the countries that perform particularly well."
"We also think it is right, and this is a very important point, that appropriations should automatically lapse if they do not give rise to payments within a specified time."
"We believe this to be very significant; it means that the Commission's approach on structural aid - and, I would add, perhaps also with a view to creating more jobs - to a large extent coincides with our judgement."
"I would also like to confirm that the relationship between commitments and payments has become very good and sensible."
"However, that is not the real problem with structural aid."
"The problem is as follows: it was decided at the Edinburgh summit to spend some ECU 175 billion on structural aid under the various Funds."
"Of this amount, however, only ECU 85 billion has been spent so far, in other words more than ECU 90 billion is still waiting to be disbursed."
"To this can be added another ECU 5 billion from the previous programming period, and it is an illusion to think that this sum of ECU 95 billion might still be spent in the two remaining years of this programming period."
"These payments will have to be made in the years that follow."
"Let me briefly mention to you the widening and deepening of our cooperation with national audit institutions."
"This is more than just a formal process, because it ensures that the arguments of the Member States which are audited are included with more emphasis in our reports."
"A few days ago, the heads of the institutions of all 15 EU Member States visited us to coordinate this work, and at the beginning of the year a conference took place in Warsaw with the heads of the East European audit institutions, under the chairmanship of the Polish audit institution and the European Court of Auditors."
"As a result, I can tell you that the structures for cooperation between the East European audit institutions are now similar to those we have within the EU."
"This is important because they will be our future colleagues in Central and Eastern Europe, and because these East European audit institutions will increasingly have the right to audit European Union resources on the spot."
"In conclusion, may I offer our thanks for the excellent cooperation we have had with Parliament."
"On behalf of the Court, I would like to thank, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control under its active, wise and intelligent chairman Mrs Diemut Theato, together with the rapporteur responsible for us, Mr Brinkhorst. Finally, I would like to thank all of you who have listened to me here at this early hour of the morning."
"(Applause) Let me add one further point."
"This year too, we are also presenting a statement of assurance for the general budget and the European Development Funds."
"Contrary to the practice of previous years, we have not quantified the irregularities which we established; we are thus presenting a qualified statement of assurance rather than a quantified one."
"We want to avoid quoting percentages that might lead to misinterpretation."
"In general, I can say that this year's statement of assurance for the general budget essentially draws the same conclusions as it has done in previous years."
"This means that, apart from the continuing problems with the recording of fixed assets, debts and liquid assets, the Court believes that the accounts for the 1997 financial year reliably reflect the Community's revenue and expenditure for the year and the financial situation at the end of the year."
"The transactions underlying the revenue are, taken as a whole, legal and regular."
"In the case of customs duties and agricultural levies, however, no assurance can be given as to whether all taxable imports have actually been declared and have generated the corresponding revenue."
"In the Court's opinion, the transactions underlying the commitments are also, taken as a whole, legal and regular, although some commitments were effected either without budgetary authorisation or without a legal base."
"As regards the transactions underlying the payments, however, the Court is again, as in previous years, unable to given any positive assurance, as they are affected by too many irregularities."
"The statement of assurance for the Sixth and Seventh European Development Funds for the year 1997, on the other hand, is, on the whole, essentially positive, and that also includes the transactions underlying the payments."
"Thank you very much for that additional comment, Mr Friedmann."
"Mrs Wemheuer has the floor."
"Mr President, President Friedmann, you know that staffing policy was one of the five points which caused the European Parliament to postpone the discharge for 1996."
"I mention this because staffing policy is referred to in almost all of your reports."
"One extreme example is the case of ECHO, which involved falsification of contracts."
"I say that it is an extreme case, but issues such as mini-budgets, exceeding the limit of the Liikanen facility, which you have just mentioned, and combinations of interests arise again and again, and the same applies to transferring too much authority to external personnel, with all the consequences that follow both in financial and political terms."
"In the report on nuclear safety you wrote that such measures even undermine the credibility and authority of the Commission."
"It is therefore a very broad area."
"However, I believe it is not merely a question of staffing policy, but that it also has financial repercussions."
"I therefore have two questions."
"Firstly, to allow us to assess the situation, could you summarise for us from all the special reports what your opinion is of the Commission's staffing policy?"
"Secondly, can we expect a report on this specific issue, or can we call upon you to provide this?"
"Mr President, President Friedmann, firstly I would like to reciprocate to you and to the Court of Auditors the thanks that you extended to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to Parliament as a whole for the work we have achieved together."
"We have worked together very closely, increasingly so over the years, in fact, and I believe this is very useful in investigating good financial and budgetary management and in intervening where necessary, where something is not working properly."
"This is not done in order to cause or to publicise scandals but to develop preventive measures, as you emphasised strongly."
"Wherever there are subsidies, there is unfortunately also the risk of fraud, if indeed it is not inherent."
"I come now to the report presented by the Court of Auditors for 1997."
"This sets in motion the discharge procedure which we will now begin."
"It is remarkable in two respects; the first is that we have not yet concluded the discharge procedure for 1996 and are already beginning another one."
"We must be careful not to confuse the two, but of course it cannot be denied that there are certain points that are common to both."
"The second point that is worthy of note is that you have presented a significantly higher number of individual reports or special reports this year for 1997, and also retrospectively for 1996."
"You highlighted the fact that the annual report had simply become too long, which meant that all the information came at once and at a time when everything had to be processed, so of course something always slipped through the net."
"We must now adjust our method of working in accordance with this, as we could almost take up a whole year of debates before the House dealing with these Court of Auditors reports."
"However, as this is simply not possible we have decided to summarise them to some extent."
"But I strongly support what Mrs Wemheuer has just said on this matter."
"In her comments she raised the issue of how we are to approach staffing policy."
"This question is addressed to the Commission but also to the budgetary authority."
"How are we to allocate staff and approve posts in future?"
"You also mentioned this in your report."
"I am also particularly grateful to you for having very clearly highlighted the issue of own resources."
"In view of the loss of revenue, partly from customs duties, as we established in our committee of inquiry into fraud in the transit system, we must ask how much is lost due to a lack of coordination in our work."
"We are still examining this whole question, and I would ask you to continue to give it your attention."
"I have a further question concerning the annual report."
"We would like this report to be published earlier, as you know."
"Will you be able to work towards presenting it in October in future?"
"I would like to say a final word to Mr Liikanen."
"I listened very carefully yesterday to what you said on the subject of the MED programmes."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that I did not find it terribly enlightening or very promising as far as the 1996 discharge is concerned."
"We will have a great deal more to discuss on this issue."
"Mr President, as always, it is a great pleasure to listen to President Friedmann's presentation of the accounts - this time for 1997."
"Over the coming months we will have an opportunity of discussing in greater depth all the detailed points and, quite clearly, it is important to note that a number of improvements have taken place."
"In the few minutes available, I wish to concentrate on a very central point which should be emphasized more in the future."
"President Friedmann rightly states that enormous responsibility lies with the Member States both for resources and for expenditure."
"One hundred per cent of resources come from the Member States."
"He stated just now that 40 years on the Community Member States' customs authorities still do not cooperate."
"He states also that on the issue of VAT, 70 billion - nearly the total amount of the budget of the Community - is not collected by the Member States."
"That means that 80 % of expenditure is also spent by the Member States."
"The various cases he mentions - durum wheat, New Zealand butter, environment policy - all relate to lack of action in that area."
"I am very happy to hear him say that cooperation with the national courts of auditors has improved."
"But I would like to make more specific points."
"Could the Court of Auditors enter into specific agreements with the national courts of auditors so that they perform tasks on behalf of the European Community budget, too?"
"I know that there are all kinds of constitutional problems - sensitivity, national pride, and what have you - but if the figures he indicates even approximate reality, it is intolerable that the Community is still a lame duck as far as the Member States are concerned."
"The general public's perception is that the Community is squandering money, that the European Union does not do its duty, whether it is on nuclear safety, the environment or agriculture."
"But, in fact, a large amount of responsibility lies with the Member States."
"I call on the President here and Commissioner Liikanen to make it clearer to the outside world that only if Member States are ready to overcome old-fashioned ideas about national sovereignty can we really have significant improvement in terms of the environment, nuclear safety and fraud."
"This is the central point."
"I would like the President to elaborate on this specific point because it will be relevant for the whole of next year when we discuss this specific declaration of assurance."
"Mr President, I was very interested in the section of the Court's report relating to own resources, because this debate is at the heart of the political problems that are going to be mentioned and that are already being mentioned within the European Council on the future financing of the Union."
"The findings are incredible: the Court of Auditors shows that, since the last audit, the amount of revenue lost has doubled to ECU 70 billion."
"That is an overall assessment."
"However, we would be extremely interested to know, Mr President of the Court, if the Court can tell us whether or not this sum of ECU 70 billion is spread evenly and fairly between the various Member States."
"In other words, are certain Member States more at fault than others in terms of the collection of the own resources of the European Union?"
"If this is the case - as I happen to believe it is - I imagine that this fact would certainly be politically very difficult to demonstrate."
"Nevertheless, it would be very useful for Members when assessing the discussions that are going to take place within the Council, particularly if certain countries put forward the concept of net balance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks for the presentation of the Court of Auditors report."
"I was particularly interested in the chapter on foreign policy."
"As you know, in deciding to postpone the discharge for 1996 we paid particular attention to the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes."
"I have now read the new Court of Auditors report for 1997, bearing in mind our criticism from 1996, 1995 and also 1994, because I wanted to know whether there is any improvement in how our money is managed in the area of foreign policy."
"The new report for 1997 has confirmed my opinion that the Commission obviously still finds it difficult - and I am saying this from a completely neutral point of view - to take action on the problems it discovers in the large PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes, action that would enable us to say that things really will be better next year."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission: why should Parliament believe that the assurances that next year will bring an improvement really will come true?"
"Mr President, Mr Friedmann should not be surprised if the House is hardly full to bursting, and also if there are spaces in the press gallery: it is because, once again, we have read much more of this report in the newspapers over the past few days than we have heard here from the horse's mouth today."
"The first remark I would make, therefore, is that the Court of Auditors - from where leaked information often gives a partial picture of its reports - should pay more attention to this aspect, which is important if it is true that reports should be produced to the public here in this forum."
"Mr Friedmann, you quite rightly referred several times to the question of staffing and to ECHO, and you have good cause to do so."
"Parliament has discussed and approved your report on ECHO, and indeed we approved a document of yours at the beginning of this year."
"If we are correctly informed, although you state in your report that the Commission does not grant sufficient resources, it is the world's leading donor. I believe that your report refers to external staff as one tangible problem."
"Well, all I would say - and I hope you will agree, because your neighbour can certainly pass you the latest figures - is that we are not talking here about ECHO submarines; what we, and perhaps the Court too, should be considering is an entire fleet of U-boats."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, the annual report for the 1997 financial year mentions the existence of an audit concerning a sample of 100 information and communication projects implemented by the Commission."
"A special report, Report No 23, is in the pipeline."
"We are looking forward to receiving it, but the Court does, however, make several comments regarding the budgetary heading B3-300."
"On one page, and one page only, it makes a number of criticisms about the lack of specific objectives and the lack of an appropriate system to monitor and assess the impact of the objectives involved."
"It notes that certain projects that have benefited from financial support from the Community budget have no demonstrable link with information policy activities."
"Indeed, for many years, our group has constantly condemned the lack of transparency, consistency and democracy in what the European Union calls its 'information policy'."
"That is why I would like to ask the following question: what type of precise recommendation does the Court intend to make to the Commission so that it puts an end to the ideological drifts that are characteristic of headings B3-300 and B3-306?"
"And more precisely, what exactly does the Court mean when it refers to 'equal treatment of final beneficiaries' and 'a policy and financial planning framework in order to define the overall objectives of information policy'?"
"These are the very terms used in the report that suggest that changes are needed to put an end to these problems."
"Mr President, the European Court of Auditors points out that in terms of external actions, the European Union has become one of the largest donors in the world with a total of ECU 6 billion, or almost FRF 40 billion."
"But your report, Mr Friedman, highlights serious shortcomings, particularly in public procurement procedures, the quality of contractors and, finally, the follow-up procedures for the actions."
"This being the case, do you not think that there is a serious risk, particularly in certain countries such as those of the former Soviet Union, that Community aid, rather than helping the people, only in fact serves to increase corruption and the power of the mafias?"
"Would it not therefore be wise to reduce this type of aid, which can do more harm than good, and wait for proper control procedures that guarantee that Community aid is used effectively and honestly?"
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Friedmann and thank him and the Court of Auditors for their report."
"Would he agree with me if I suggested to him that the rather alarmist headlines of £3 billion fraud are not borne out by the annual report and the accompanying special reports?"
"I am sure he will understand if I concentrate the rest of my remarks on the revenue side of the budget."
"The first thing I would say to him - and I hope he accepts it in the spirit in which it is said - is that it is not really the Court of Auditors' responsibility to challenge the Fontainebleau Agreement on the United Kingdom budgetary rebate."
"Any change to the own-resources decision will require unanimity in the Council between the parties involved and the Court of Auditors will not be one of those parties."
"Concerning the own-resources side of the budget, would he agree with me that it is an extremely serious picture that is painted?"
"In traditional own-resources we see evidence of the difficulty of collection and the propensity to fraud."
"But when we look at the very valuable analysis that has been done on VAT collection in the Member States, we see this alarming figure of a gap between the theoretical VAT yield and the actual collection running at ECU 70 000m a year."
"That not only has an effect on Member States but also on the GNP and VAT based receipts."
"Finally, it is reasonable to say - and I hope Mr Friedmann agrees with me - that there should be no substantial increase in own resources until all income is collected and until we can be reassured that all revenue is not only legal but is properly, efficiently and effectively spent."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Friedmann and the other members of the Court of Auditors present in the gallery for being here today."
"I believe that the procedure for granting discharge for 1996, which has not yet been granted by Parliament, is excellent proof of the importance of the Court of Auditors' reports in this area."
"In any case, this discharge will result in important methods and tools becoming available to Parliament in terms of the financial control of other institutions, notably the Commission. In particular, these will involve the ability to request documents and other relevant information."
"Mr President of the Court of Auditors, I should like to comment on the section on Structural Funds and put some questions to you in that connection."
"The Court has consistently criticised the large number of administrative irregularities in structural expenditure."
"You point out that there is very little coordination between the Member States and the Court you so ably preside."
"You hope to receive from the Member States in 1998 the first reports on the implementation of the regulation unifying the Member States' provisions for financial control in operations cofinanced by the Structural Funds."
"Have you received these reports yet?"
"And if so, what is your assessment of them?"
"You have also presented very detailed conclusions as to the number and nature of substantive errors in the Structural Funds."
"However, this seems to contradict your statements on the lack of coordination on the part of Member States."
"I would repeat the argument I have put forward in previous years: in my view, it is impossible to produce a reliable estimate if you do not have a well-established coordination procedure involving the national control institutions."
"I would therefore like to ask: has progress been made?"
"Is this coordination currently taking place?"
"Finally, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, I should like to point out that the majority of Structural Funds are actually allocated during this last part of the programming period."
"This does not seem to me to be clear from your remarks, and could perhaps lead to confusion amongst some of the more naive Members of the House."
"Mr President of the Court of Auditors, the Edinburgh Council decided upon a multi-annual programming of expenditure until the financial perspective expires at the end of 1999."
"According to the Court's audit, ECU 70 billion have not yet been spent."
"Why is there this delay?"
"Is it mismanagement by the Commission?"
"Or is it that the Member States are implementing, through Structural Fund expenditure, the policy known, in French, as the policy of the juste retour ?"
"Which Member States could be picked out as the bad pupils?"
"In my view, the Edinburgh Agreement should be honoured since maintaining the structural actions allowed by those Funds is the key to balance in southern Europe."
"To end with, I have one more question: can those ECU 70 billion still be used or not?"
"Mr President, we should be happy that only ECU 300 million were spent of the total ECU 850 million of PHARE and TACIS funds made available for nuclear safety, because 80 % of the money was scandalously spent on safety studies of dubious value, simply on paperwork."
"On top of that, it stayed in Western hands without any proper methodology, evaluation or consultation, and without the eastern European countries being informed of the results of the studies."
"What this amounts to is simply money down the drain, and we have not even achieved the slightest improvement in safety as a result."
"That is the true scandal, and here I would like to hear from the Commission how it intends to put a stop to such situations in future."
"Secondly, I would like to give an example of how money is wasted."
"For the purpose of a rather dubious investigation a study costing ECU 170 000 was undertaken to preserve the Siberian tiger."
"The study was carried out in Italy, filed away and forgotten about, and it was concluded that the tiger would simply die out."
"So that was the end of that."
"Something else could have been done with this money."
"This is how the Commission wastes money on studies which do not lead to any action bring taken."
"I would therefore like to know what will be done in the near future with the ECU 550 million that we have left for nuclear safety, and whether we will continue to have studies of dubious value without any action being taken as a result."
"Mr President, it is surely amazing that the president of the Court of Auditors has to report on the loss of millions by the Commission."
"The Commission, while allowing this to happen, adopts an entirely different attitude to the pig producers of Northern Ireland."
"The devastated pig producers there have had to have a financially-assisted scheme to remove unwanted animals from their farms."
"Now the Commission says that the farmers must repay this money which prevented cruelty to animals."
"The Commission allows millions to be lost but has no consideration for those in the most desperate circumstances."
"I would put on record today the call of those of us in this House who are from Northern Ireland to stop increasing the desperation of our pig producers."
"Already some of have become so desperate that they have been driven to suicide."
"Mr President, when I received the Court of Auditors' annual report yesterday, I read it with great interest."
"As a Dane, I was naturally interested in what it had to say about Denmark."
"I have read the report countless times overnight, but I cannot find anything about Denmark in it."
"Of course, I am glad that we are doing things properly in our country."
"It is always good to be able to take that as a starting-point."
"I noted that there have been a number of special reports, and I would like to say that one of them which really made an impression on me is the one which has featured in the press for the last fortnight and deals with safety in nuclear power plants."
"I would like to ask Mr Friedmann, and also Mr Liikanen and the Commission, not just to focus on nuclear power plants in the eastern countries."
"We should perhaps also be looking at the situation in Murmansk, where there are several hundred submarines which have been scrapped but still have active reactors, and where a number of reactors have been dumped in the Barents Sea."
"I really do think that we need to have a special report on this area, and I think that instead of going on talking about these things and employing expensive consultants and a good deal more besides, we should employ people ourselves and send them out there to start the necessary process."
"That naturally requires there to be cooperation with the Member States."
"I know that is difficult, but we must do something about this."
"The greatest time bomb that we have is the nuclear power plants and the submarines which are lying around."
"All the other small-scale fraud which is happening round about should also be addressed, but it must not be our top priority."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Friedmann and the Court on their best-seller report again this year."
"When he presented it last night to the Budgetary Control Committee the room was full - people were perched on windows and tables and even sitting on the floor."
"Of course the media were there looking for the 'f' word but fraud is scrupulously not mentioned in the report."
"I was disappointed particularly by the phrase that 'substantive errors affecting transaction underlying payments' was in the same range as in previous years."
"I take some encouragement from the postscript to President Friedmann's speech this morning where he said that there was some improvement."
"That is what we are looking for - improvement."
"In paragraph 1.18 there is a quotation from the transit report where we called for the Community customs services to work together as if they were one."
"The gaps between them provide this figure of about 70 billion lost to the Member States in a year, 35 to 40 times the amount which is actually defrauded from the EC budget."
"I wish finance ministers would take note of this."
"I am interested in Chapter 6 on administration."
"Thank you for the various reports we have had from the agencies."
"You mentioned specifically Turin and the fact that ECU 380m from PHARE and TACIS spent by that agency is not included in their accounts."
"One hopes that it is hidden somewhere in the Commission accounts."
"As for the schools, I would point out that the fact that four of the schools have more external pupils than Community pupils poses a problem."
"I wonder if we should transfer some of the cash to overcrowded schools in other places."
"Madam President, President Friedmann, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of UCLAF, you consider the creation of an additional institution to combat fraud to be problematic, as you said last week at our interparliamentary conference and again yesterday."
"However, we have heard that this is precisely what is currently being prepared by the Commission."
"A proposal for a regulation on the basis of Article 235 of the EC Treaty on creating an external assessment agency, as it is called, is evidently in the process of being drafted by the Commission."
"The Commission is giving the false impression that in doing so it is complying with Parliament's request to create an OLAF, an office for fraud prevention."
"I would like to make it clear that this is not the case, Commissioner Liikanen."
"What Parliament called for with a large majority at the beginning of October was not an additional institution."
"Instead, we want the current UCLAF to be replaced by an office of fraud prevention with full operational independence, but not one that is a satellite organisation somewhere outside the institutions of the EU."
"An external solution is not valid as long as we do not have a European public prosecution authority."
"No, OLAF should remain within the Commission and all other institutions of the Union should be involved in it. I would now like to ask you, President Friedmann, whether it could be of interest to the Court of Auditors to be involved in an office of this kind and to contribute its experience."
"Has the Court of Auditors formed an opinion on this yet?"
"Madam President, I would like to discuss the planning and implementation of actions in the field of external aid."
"The scale of Community activities in this area has in recent years increased continuously in both political and financial terms."
"Moreover, neither the extent nor the importance of these activities will decrease in the coming years."
"Following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, in fact, the opposite is to be expected."
"The content of the Court of Auditors' annual report is therefore all the more worrying as it has found considerable shortcomings in all phases of preparation, implementation and assessment of the actions by the Commission."
"The cost/benefit outcome currently falls far short of its potential, and it is not clear whether restructuring measures within the Commission, for example the creation of a common service for all external aid and ECHO, can solve all these management problems."
"Unfortunately, as we have already seen, while the creation of a separate common service results in improvement of management capacities, it also distances political and economic services from the implementation of policies."
"The question I would like to ask the Court of Auditors is the following: is the Court of Auditors of the opinion that the creation of the common service RELEX will result in significant improvements or is it necessary, particularly in view of the future tasks of the Union in this area, to think of completely new solutions?"
"Madam President, thank you very much for the many very interesting questions."
"Mrs Wemheuer - and this also fits in with what Mrs Krehl has just said - you expressed criticism about staffing policy."
"On the one hand, it is astonishing that the administrative costs of the European Union represent in total approximately 5 % of the budget, including personnel expenditure."
"But this does not say much as European Union policy must be implemented by the administrations of the Member States."
"As you know, Mrs Wemheuer, we referred some time ago to fact that the mini-budgets used at the time were to be heavily criticised."
"Parliament kindly took control and resolved the matter by granting the Commission a generous number of posts for permanent staff."
"In the meantime, however, it has emerged that, despite this, more of the operational budget is once again being spent on a decentralised staffing policy and in particular on employing external consultants and experts."
"This was why I criticised these Liikanen facilities whose limit is being exceeded."
"In this respect I share your concern about the Commission's staffing policy."
"I will discuss with the members of the Court whether and to what extent we could examine this in a special report and how it would fit into our schedule."
"Mrs Theato, thank you for your comments."
"I appreciate that you wish to receive the annual report earlier."
"The actual problem is the time needed for the contradictory procedure, though the period agreed does not even take account of the summer recess."
"We must enter into intensive talks with the Commission, as we discussed yesterday in the Committee on Budgetary Control, in order to clarify to what extent this period can be reduced and the Financial Regulation amended accordingly."
"Mr Brinkhorst, it is clear why you place importance on cooperation with the national courts of auditors."
"We have developed a particular procedure whereby we write a sectoral letter when our auditors come back from the Member States; this means that the relevant auditing sector writes to the Member State and to the relevant national court of auditors in order to inform them of the results."
"The Member State can then reply to us, usually via the national court of auditors, and if we do not reply to this within two months it means that we are in agreement with the Member State's reply."
"Therefore, if each party meets its deadline the arguments of the country being audited are taken into account in our annual report and in the special reports."
"Mr Pasty, like several of your colleagues, you referred to the ECU 70 billion that have been lost in VAT revenue."
"This figure of 70 billion refers to the model calculations based on nine Member States and is the annual average over four years."
"We calculated it by adding up the VAT actually paid and comparing this figure with the sum of the Member States' total gross national product."
"This gives an indication of the sum not paid."
"We can also account for this in detail, but of course the Member States are the first to be affected by this loss, and obviously the Community is indirectly affected by it to a certain extent."
"To give you an idea of the magnitude of this I could say that the sum lost by the Member States in the form of VAT revenue is in the order of the budget of the European Union."
"Mrs Müller, on the issue of foreign policy and the question of whether the situation is improving, I have to say quite honestly that we cannot give the all-clear."
"We always provide timely information on everything, but we cannot say that currently everything is exactly as it should be."
"Mr Dell'Alba, I understand your anger regarding the newspaper reports."
"However, I must make two points here."
"Firstly, many newspaper reports simply rehash the special reports already published officially by us."
"Sometimes the impression is given that the annual report has been leaked, but I am not aware of any incident of this kind."
"However, I understand your concern, and we in the European Court of Auditors generally agree that Parliament has the right to be the first to be informed."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you addressed the issue of information policy."
"We have referred to a few points in that area."
"The content of the information policy is outside our jurisdiction."
"We do not see it as our job to censor the information the Commission feels it has to provide, but we insist that the delegations, or whoever may be concerned, must be capable of meeting their responsibilities."
"Mr Le Gallou, the question is whether we should reduce humanitarian aid if, as we say, so much money does not actually reach the people concerned."
"This is a political issue but in my personal opinion I would ask you to bear in mind that it is probably the very poorest who have to suffer as a result of others not being honest."
"That should be taken into account in this decision."
"Lord Tomlinson, you stated that British press reports of fraud in the order of three billion pounds are not borne out by the content of our annual report."
"We deliberately mention irregularities, as you know, and I should make it clear - here we are in agreement - that the report of the European Court of Auditors is not a fraud report; rather, we check for legality, regularity and sound financial management, and the content of the report reflects this."
"I understand your reference to the Fontainebleau Agreement as a UK Member of Parliament."
"We addressed this issue in our special report on the Community's own resources."
"We do not regard it as our job to tell the political powers how possible changes should be made to the contributions paid by the Member States."
"However, we did note that it had been arranged in Fontainebleau that should adjustments be decided on for political reasons, then expenditure policy too must be changed."
"Mr Garriga Polledo, you mentioned the Structural Funds and asked whether we received reports from the Member States and how coordination with the Member States works."
"In fact, we exchange views continuously with the Member States, particularly in the area of structural aid."
"The issue of why this delay has arisen in the programming period was touched on later; one of your colleagues also mentioned it."
"I must say that at the beginning of the programming period a certain amount of time is always needed for work to get properly underway."
"We are seeing this at the moment with the new Member States, with the result that at the end of the programming period a backlog tends to build up."
"However, the problem of co-financing in the Member States was doubtless partly responsible for this, as when we request co-financing the Member States are often obliged to incur additional debts."
"We must understand that this was not easy in the run-up to monetary union."
"So it is a combination of several factors that account for the delay."
"In my opinion, the money will have to be paid via the budget outside the programming period."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes, you mentioned Edinburgh and asked why there has been a delay over the ECU 90 billion. I hope I answered this question together with that of Mr Garriga Polledo."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, you addressed the issue of nuclear safety."
"The way in which companies have awarded subcontracts is indeed a problem."
"Some contractors have taken the price of Western experts as the basis for the terms specified in the contracts, but in fact employed east European experts to do the work."
"The fees of Western experts are about fifteen times higher than those of their east European counterparts."
"But you are right, and I think this is the opinion of the entire House: a nuclear safety strategy is urgently needed and should be given priority."
"Mr Blak, you mentioned that there is a big problem with submarines in Murmansk."
"As you know, this is a military issue that is not within the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Auditors."
"We can only audit in connection with the EU budget - we have already discussed this in the Court of Auditors, and I will bring it up once again - but I must first remind you that these submarines in Murmansk are a military matter, with which we are not directly involved."
"I understand your concern, and we will discuss this again."
"You also mentioned that in Denmark everything is in order."
"Mr Blak, I am pleased that you believe you can draw this conclusion, but the fact that we do not criticise something does not mean that everything is in order."
"That is obvious."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, you are right to say that the Community loses considerable customs revenue in transit traffic."
"You are also right to say that the European Schools have more external pupils than children of EU staff, and in view of the high deficit this is a point that needs to be clarified."
"We have also referred to this in the relevant special report."
"Mr Bösch, your question concerning whether we would be prepared to accept OLAF being affiliated to the European Court of Auditors in some way was a very difficult one."
"It must be clear that the nature of the tasks involved is quite different."
"I repeat, and on this we are in agreement, that the European Court of Auditors is not a criminal investigation department or a police force."
"There is a good reason for this, as much of our auditing leads to consultation work."
"I also appreciate your idea that if an independent unit of this kind is to be responsible for all the institutions without becoming a new institution itself, you need an existing institution to which you can affiliate OLAF."
"I can only say in this discussion that the nature of the task is not the same; it is quite different."
"You will have to make the political decision, and the Court of Auditors will have to accept what is decided by the legislator."
"In conclusion, Mrs Krehl, I believe I have already answered your question on creating a separate common service, on staffing policy and administration."
"Finally, I would like to thank you all very much for your keen interest."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"Employment in the Union"
"The next item is the report (A4-0417/98) by Mr Wim van Velzen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication: Proposal for guidelines for Member States' employment policies 1999 (COM(98)0574 - C4-0587/98)."
"Madam President, looking at what has happened a year on from when the first guidelines were drawn up, I think we can rightly speak of a quiet revolution."
"Initial opposition to an active labour market policy and the near-total belief in EMU and the jobs it would create have actually disappeared."
"There is not one Member State which has failed to take on board the guidelines agreed in Luxembourg."
"That is an extremely good thing."
"But things could be even better."
"If we look at the evaluation carried out by the Commission, and it is a first-class evaluation, you will see that the Member States' approach to the guidelines has been one of picking and choosing and that often the choice they have made has been unbalanced, placing too much emphasis on employment and entrepreneurship."
"At the same time, however, it might be said that those guidelines which were the most precisely, most exactly formulated have also produced the best results, and that is an argument for continuing with the strategy."
"But I do have a problem with the proposals put forward by the European Commission."
"I do not think they keep the process in a sharp enough focus."
"By sharp focus, I mean ensuring that quantified objectives are as far as possible based on benchmarking."
"That is the best way of keeping the Member States' minds on the job."
"I have no sympathy at all for those Member States which say 'we already have so much to do; let us cut down a bit, let us not have any new objectives'."
"The work we are adding is all work which they have to do in the normal course of events."
"We are just trying to target it at European level towards common goals which we have previously defined."
"The current process, developed in Luxembourg, focuses strongly on people already out of work - quite properly, as things stood at the time."
"I think it is now time to look also at how, whilst helping the unemployed, we can stop more and more unemployed people from joining them."
"How can we get more attention paid to prevention?"
"This, in my view, will have enormous implications for education."
"Hence my request for an additional objective for those who are now employed but who need further training to make sure they stay abreast of new developments."
"Another problem which I myself feel is not taken into account enough in the objectives is participation in the work process."
"There are large groups for whom it remains difficult to break into the labour market, even in my own country of the Netherlands, which is reckoned to be successful."
"In the Netherlands you find older people over 55, you find migrants and still women too who have trouble finding work."
"It is no different in other countries of the Union."
"That is just employment policy, not unimportant - far from it - but it is just one side of the coin."
"The other side is this: what are we doing on the economic front?"
"What are we doing about economic coordination?"
"What are we doing to deepen the process begun with EMU?"
"What use are we making of these opportunities?"
"I think the moment for making a start has long since passed."
"But given the fact that we are now debating this report, I think we must urge the Council to produce, as quickly as possible, a framework in which economic coordination can really take shape."
"Other speakers will cover this in more depth."
"At this point, I would mention an aspect touched on earlier by the Commission, namely the fact that there is a large measure of under-investment in Europe."
"Where are the Commission's plans, its proposals for tackling that problem?"
"Where are the opportunities for broadening the financial initiatives taken at Member State level?"
"In my country - as I said just now - we seem to have been successful."
"A decision has been taken there to cut back the programme for giving school children more computer-oriented education, due to shortage of funds, and now there are one or two pioneering schools which will get computers whilst all the rest will have to wait years before they get them."
"A laughable investment failure!"
"So in an area where we ought to be investing in the future, one of the European countries with the best record is unable to come up with the cash."
"I think that should prompt the Council to reflect about what we can do to give Member States more room for manoeuvre."
"I am not coming down in favour of one proposal rather than the other."
"It is a package of proposals, and I think we have to choose very carefully here."
"Lastly, I am very surprised by the PPE Group's amendments I have seen, admittedly very late, because we have very little time."
"They have retabled all the amendments they had originally tabled in the Social Affairs Committee."
"May I remind you that the PPE coordinator volunteered the information during the part-session that I had done an excellent job by incorporating their proposals into my report, that there was still just one difference of opinion remaining which concerned investment policy, but that otherwise he was very happy."
"Now all the amendments are being put down again unseen, even those which are already in my report."
"I find that incomprehensible."
"I hope I can reach a more satisfactory resolution of this with the PPE Group, because I think it is putting our future cooperation in jeopardy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in two minutes it is hard to summarise the opinion I drafted for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and which was unanimously approved."
"The basic idea was that the creation of jobs, a higher rate of employment for Europe, will only become a solid, stable and lasting reality if it is based on a truly competitive economy and on what we term a globalised or internationalised economy. Unfortunately, the European Union is not yet in a position to cope with the level of competition demanded by an open economy."
"These include the need to eliminate barriers and systems of protection that still exist in key areas of our economy and the need to increase our level of knowledge. We must also improve our level of education, particularly in the areas of vocational and technical training."
"The possibility of modifying VAT, value added tax, must be considered, with a view to reducing it in the so-called labour-intensive sectors, the sectors with the largest workforce. I should also mention the need to provide new and improved guidance in terms of allowing better access to finance, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to promote a better business environment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr van Velzen's excellent report, which the PSE Group supports, is rightly based on lasting, sustainable strategies to combat mass unemployment, but also on innovative adjustment of the employment guidelines."
"Of particular importance are the structural elements for the promotion of structural reform of the labour market, the need to bring about a better balance among the four pillars of the employment guidelines and the emphasis on gender mainstreaming."
"At the same time, however, the totally inadequate employment recovery must be regarded as a challenge for the Union and the Member States to achieve a better and more balanced policy mix and to improve coordination of economic, financial and employment policies."
"As we are now only a few weeks away from the beginning of monetary union it is high time to integrate guidelines for economic policy and for employment so that the accent can deliberately be put on effectiveness in creating employment as a condition for policy coordination, in good time for the national budget debates."
"The European Parliament must at long last be involved in an interinstitutional agreement on this issue."
"The parties to the collective agreement are also called upon, in view of monetary union, to begin to harmonise productivity-based wage agreements in order to avoid the risk of wage dumping that would adversely affect the Community."
"Once again, calls are being made for a review of the basic elements of economic policy and for proper coordination of economic policy."
"The European Union cannot afford to sit back, despite the Commission's favourable autumn forecast."
"Even the lack of currency fluctuation that has been caused by the prospect of the euro should not induce us to sit back."
"Today we are already seeing the effects of the crisis in South-East Asia on European jobs."
"The chemical, engineering and electronics sectors are already hit by reduced orders and falling prices."
"This is affecting European jobs."
"Supply-side measures alone are not sufficient."
"Demand must also be stimulated by increasing the purchasing power of consumers and fostering greater trust in the future of the European Union."
"In this respect, the van Velzen report is right to emphasise changing the system by means of implementing tax reforms and reducing taxation on labour."
"But we also need a reform of wage structures that takes productivity into account, as well as stimulation of investment as an important means of stabilising the European economy."
"As current investment levels are much too low - public investment is currently barely 2 % of GDP - growth and employment cannot be achieved."
"Structural change in the labour market must be supported by a new prospect of growth."
"Alliances for work could successfully accompany this process."
"We still lack Europe-wide modernisation offensives with investment plans in the areas of communications, transport, the environment, energy conservation, research, development, innovation and training."
"Here we must speedily draw up an indicative list that allows a combination of public and private investment."
"In the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty the EU Ministers for Finance are called upon to separate this kind of investment from the general government deficit, as long as the EU is still caught between mass unemployment and the Stability Pact."
"Madam President, by this stage I think all the main debates concerning the employment situation in Europe have now come through the worst."
"We already have European guidelines - the Treaty of Amsterdam includes a chapter specifically on employment - and we also have a European strategy that has inspired national employment action plans."
"I feel Mr van Velzen's report bears all the hallmarks of a rushed and interim document, but I must stress that I do not in any way wish to blame him for that."
"The Commission's report reached us late, as it almost always does, and it too was wanting, as the Commission itself is not able to conduct rigorous and serious investigations at present."
"What is true, however, is that some Member States of the European Union are applying principles that are producing excellent results where job creation is concerned."
"This has been the case in my country, Spain. The results, ladies and gentlemen, speak for themselves: unemployment has been reduced by 4 %, over 800 000 jobs have been created and a meaningful social dialogue is in place that is leading to a radical reform of the labour market and greater stability of employment."
"Government and unions have recently reached agreement on important issues such as part-time work and the introduction of a new concept: 'supplementary time'."
"I believe it would be very interesting to evaluate this new formula."
"In addition, I would like to refer briefly to two key issues in any employment policy."
"The first is the relationship that ought to exist between training and employment."
"A first job depends very much on that essential link between the institutions offering education and training and the requirements of the labour market."
"There are too many instances of failure at school, inadequate training and graduate unemployment in Europe."
"Even worse, there is considerable underemployment which means human resources are not being exploited to the full."
"The second issue I would like to raise seems important to me, but is not mentioned in the report. It concerns the strong resistance to geographical mobility within the Union and between regions of the Member States, both on the part of those seeking their first job and the unemployed."
"This situation has as much to do with income policies as with language problems and the shortage of affordable housing for these people."
"As a result of the lack of mobility and of migratory flows between regions, unemployment becomes structural and prices and costs are destabilised, with the consequent negative impact on the competitiveness of businesses."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to Mr van Velzen for having incorporated paragraph 9 into his report."
"This concerns the evaluation of the venture capital we provide through the Investment Bank."
"We have been looking this morning at the report of the Court of Auditors, and it transpires that this provision of venture capital is not exactly satisfactory."
"The criteria are too general, there is no cohesive policy and the use of interest margins is unclear."
"But above all, and I would stress this, the Commission has no role other than that of information exchange."
"I think that where we ourselves are at issue, in a report in which we are primarily asking the Member States to do certain things, we should have our own house in order."
"So I seriously urge the Commission to produce an evaluation on this point very soon for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"If it is not forthcoming, I shall ask questions in the committee myself."
"Many speakers have already said as much, ladies and gentlemen, and the advent of Economic and Monetary Union requires measures to be taken in a number of policy areas."
"This report indicates that the Member States are beginning to take them, through the reform of tax and social security systems and all manner of measures to stimulate the labour market."
"There is one point I should like to make here: slowly but surely, power and influence are shifting from national to European level."
"This goes unnoticed by the man in the street."
"Of course we have to be in favour of most of the measures in the van Velzen report."
"We cannot live with an employment rate of 60.5 %, for example."
"But it is high time these measures were subjected to democratic debate in the Member States; we must not think, as is sometimes suggested in this House, that all this is a matter for the Member States and that the European Parliament does not need to be involved and that there is no feedback either from the process, from Europe to the European citizen."
"With the elections almost upon us, it is an absolute must, and I am thus asking the Commission whether a little more might not be done to keep us informed on this matter."
"Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mr Wim van Velzen on his report."
"Unfortunately, however, this fine report addresses appeals and wishes both to the Council of Ministers and to the Commission, and the question, Mr van Velzen, is whether the Council and the Commission have ears to hear what you are saying."
"I would remind you that in Amsterdam no substantive decision was taken regarding unemployment."
"In Luxembourg the ball was tossed into the court of the Member States."
"I would also remind you that the Maastricht criteria on economic and monetary union deliberately do not include the criterion of unemployment."
"I would remind you that both in the 1998 budget and in the budget for 1999 we will be voting on in a month's time, expenditure to combat unemployment for social Europe, for people with special needs and for the third age is either static or even lower, and all this at a time when, as you say in your report, full-time jobs are continually becoming fewer and only part-time jobs are being created."
"Consequently, incomes are down in a Europe in which costs are going up, and that is why the proportion of nouveaux pauvres has climbed above 15 %."
"I am sorry to see that this is taking place with the approval of Parliament, which on 2 May 1998 put social Europe into the hands of bankers and EMU."
"Madam President, the European left in all its diverse forms now has the chance to show that it is really serious when it comes to increasing employment."
"Of the fifteen Member States, the left is in government in one form or another in thirteen."
"My impression is that European voters are looking to the left for protection against the forces of money and uncontrolled market trends."
"Is it at all possible for the left to respond to the wishes of the voters?"
"The different formulas left-wing governments have come up with are very much at odds with one another."
"While Britain continues to rely on the market to create jobs, in France and Italy there is a drive to shorten working hours and raise public spending to increase employment."
"Furthermore, the conditions agreed previously by the EU countries on economic and monetary union are slowing down progress."
"We now need to create a programme for economic revival and employment based on four vital elements."
"The first of these is the lowering of interest rates, to prevent Europe from falling into the abyss."
"Unfortunately, the European Central Bank, which is ruled by the economic dogma of the last couple of decades, does not seem ready to lower interest rates so that production and employment might increase."
"Secondly, taxation has to be changed to encourage people to work."
"The current tax system favours ownership, investments and lazy money too much, and penalises work."
"Thirdly, we have to increase investment, especially in the area of transport and communications."
"It is also time we stopped regarding public services as a harmful extravagance and admitted they are immensely important in creating jobs and the infrastructure we vitally need."
"Fourthly, we must embark on action to shorten working time generally."
"The ways and means may vary from country to country and from region to region, but the objective must be a common one."
"Mr President, we are all keen for the Member States to cooperate with one another, coordinating their strategies for creating sustainable employment."
"It is important that the employment guidelines are actually implemented under national action programmes."
"Member States may occasionally need a nudge to remind them to abide by the recommendations - although we have to accept that there are considerable differences in the way countries handle these matters. Discussion is of the essence, and it will take time before everything is adopted and in place."
"He wants action, but his zeal possibly gets the better of him at times. One of his proposals is for economic and financial policy coordination - a very far-reaching enterprise indeed."
"Most of his suggestions are very good, nonetheless. I particularly like his ideas on reducing working hours in a flexible way."
"And he rightly sets his proposal in the context of the fight against unemployment. My group has, however, tabled an amendment calling for a slightly more radical approach to cutting working hours in Europe, and I would recommend that colleagues vote for this."
"Mr President, the level of unemployment in the Union has remained far too high despite the favourable economic trends of recent years, primarily amongst the categories of the poorly educated and the long-term unemployed, and these include a great many women."
"Not only in Europe but worldwide, the pressure of world unemployment is increasing."
"I would point above all to the millions of young people in the third world who are unemployed."
"The effects of that are felt throughout Europe, and it is a factor in social dislocation and poverty."
"Problems with asylum seekers are just one part of the result."
"Stimulating employment must thus be recognised as a prime objective in the Member States, the Union and in international organisations as well."
"In view of the slow-down in economic growth we are experiencing, it is doubtless all the more important."
"The van Velzen report illustrates this especially clearly, and I am grateful to the rapporteur."
"The achievements of the European Union in the field of employment are meagre, so the report tells us."
"Differences between and within Member States remain enormous, despite the Structural Funds."
"Evaluation of the national action plans shows up positive points, it is true, but many gaps and weaknesses too."
"In my country, for example, there is the failure to reduce labour costs."
"These shortcomings also apply to the four pillars."
"Europe's leaders have concluded too late, regrettably, that a better balance is needed between a Europe of monetary union and a policy of employment."
"We echo Mr van Velzen in wanting quantified objectives, training and participation."
"We also believe above all that the choice of a European investment programme is a good choice."
"We shall vote for the resolution but there is too much in it, Mr President, and we think that ultimately we may not be able to see the wood for the trees."
"Unless Europe makes jobs a priority, there will no future for its children and thus no future for Europe itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the van Velzen report paints a clear picture of the economic situation in Europe over the past year: on the one hand, cautious optimism due to the welcome prospect of the European single currency and to slight but appreciable economic growth; on the other, a climate of distrust and instability due to all the international financial crises - in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America - the repercussions of which have had an adverse effect on the European market."
"And then there is unemployment, still the most urgent social problem facing our continent, above all for young people and women."
"Broadly speaking, therefore, we can endorse the report's approach to relaunching effective employment policies in the Member States."
"I would stress in particular the importance of vocational training, which must be improved and adapted to the requirements of the labour market."
"There is a major contradiction inherent in vocational training: it is true that the funds available are inadequate, but it is also true that a good deal of money is badly invested in poor-quality courses with a minimal impact on employment."
"The Member States should be called on, in more general terms, to overhaul their educational systems thoroughly."
"Italy's Audit Office recently bemoaned the fact that a substantial percentage of graduates have difficulty in finding jobs owing to the mediocrity of the education system, in particular the universities, where the practical and applied aspects of the theoretical instruction are all too often overlooked."
"My second point relates to women."
"They are the greatest victims of discrimination in the world of work, partly because of their family responsibilities and, where necessary, their role as carers for the elderly and the disabled."
"This House has already drawn the Commission's attention on numerous occasions to the fact that, unless proper social assistance is available for working women, especially single mothers, the right to work is nothing but a figment of the imagination."
"Finally, I should like to turn to another proposal made in the report, namely a more flexible distribution of working time."
"Where economic conditions permit, it is indeed desirable to reduce weekly working time and above all to introduce part-time work in order to create new jobs."
"But let us not forget, in accordance with the fundamental principles of subsidiarity and participation, that any reduction in working time must be agreed between the social partners, in other words not by handing down legislation which would merely be a source of pointless and harmful inflexibility."
"Mr President, the van Velzen report is excellent and very balanced."
"The rapporteur wanted to reach a consensus catering for various different European social situations in the current economic situation."
"Concerns over investment, support for small firms, assistance for companies that employ large numbers of people, working conditions, the gradual reduction in maximum working hours and improving the management thereof, wages, social protection, training leading to genuine qualifications and appropriate education systems all give a social meaning to the terms of adaptability and employability, which, without that guidance, would be cynical objectives, concerned only with economics, as I would like the Commission to remember."
"Unemployment is not inevitable but I would not wish on other countries in the European Union the solution applied in large areas of Portugal, where all three generations have to work in order to scrape together the minimum wage paid in Spain, half the minimum wage in Belgium, and a quarter the minimum wage in Germany, albeit with almost full employment."
"It is a world where, when people lose their jobs, especially women, they lose 50 % to 100 % of their income and in order to survive, they rely on strong family support, weak national solidarity and your solidarity, thanks to the European Union's cohesion."
"I support this report because it takes a significant step towards fleshing out the concept of employability."
"But we do not wish on countries experiencing high levels of unemployment a solution that only weakens citizenship and undermines the European social model."
"Mr President, the situation four years ago was as follows: at the summit in Essen we agreed a broad strategy to combat unemployment more effectively at European level by strictly observing the principle of subsidiarity."
"The situation one year ago was that we agreed guidelines at the Luxembourg Employment Summit to guarantee a high level of employment."
"The situation today is that we are publicly assessing what has and has not been achieved in the National Action Plans."
"There are gaps in particular in terms of training; not enough training is provided, not enough older workers are involved in training, training courses are not sufficiently adapted to new technologies and education systems often fail to provide practical experience, team work and knowledge of other countries."
"Employability, the first pillar of the NAPs, is therefore difficult to achieve."
"Much too little importance is placed on the fourth pillar: equal opportunities."
"Commissioner, where child care is not provided, in the form of creches, nursery schools and day care centres, it is mainly women who are denied access to a career."
"But there are also encouraging developments: more and more Member States, for example Germany, are managing to adapt to changed employment structures."
"Conditions for entrepreneurship are being improved and passive employment policies are finally being replaced by active policies."
"We must now institutionalise dialogue between the Ecofin Council, the ECB, those responsible for social policy, the social partners, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament in order to better coordinate economic and monetary policy, including the indispensable Stability Pact, with employment policy."
"The forthcoming summit in Vienna should set the right course instead of arousing false hopes such as the supposedly comprehensive investment programme worth billions that the Member States will not in any case finance."
"With a realistic approach there is a good chance that even those affected by unemployment and exclusion will feel that Europe is overcoming obstacles and inaction, is capable of coordination and can provide important impetus and new ideas."
"Mr President, current rates of development are not absorbing the high level of unemployment."
"In 1997 economic development in the European Union was 2.7 % and it is expected to be about 2.8 % in 1998, while salaries increased by just 1 % in real terms, despite which the unemployment indexes have not improved."
"Full-time jobs are becoming fewer and only part-time jobs are increasing."
"The spectre of poverty and social exclusion is already affecting or directly threatening millions of the Union's citizens."
"To be honest, how much optimism do these facts justify?"
"In our opinion, employment policy has been shown to be unreliable and a factor which exacerbates the crisis."
"That is the conclusion which the Union's citizens reach."
"But while that is the situation, the Commission's statement gives priority to the competitiveness of trade and industry, to the stability pact, to monetary stability, to the promotion of part-time employment and informal forms of work, and to employability - a concept which transfers the burden of responsibility for finding work from the state and its policy onto working people."
"Mr President, working people disapprove of this policy."
"They see no future in it, and their only recourse is to intensify their struggle to overthrow it."
"We will stand by them in that."
"Mr President, since we are talking about a social Europe, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr van Velzen and - just this once - the Commission for the action taken on the consultation of employees."
"After Vilvoorde and, more recently, Levi's, there is an urgent need to give employees greater rights when it comes to informing and consulting them about companies' investment strategies and any decision to relocate."
"This culture of information - I would even go so far as to say joint management - is a step in the right direction."
"However, I must say, more generally, that the Commission's social action programme lacks ambition and grand design."
"Obviously, reference is rightly made to reducing VAT for labour-intensive services, lowering costs for SMEs, flexibility, training, etc."
"But I would like to know what is being done about the commitments made at the Luxembourg Employment Summit in November 1997."
"It is politically vital for us to have a major project that is able to channel our efforts."
"To be honest, what we need is a new welfare state which promotes employment and lifelong learning for every citizen of the European Union."
"In other words, we must ensure that every woman and man from Lisbon to Berlin, from London to Rome, has the same hope if they lose their jobs."
"I myself dream of banishing the word unemployment from our vocabulary and this is more than just rhetorical."
"What this means in practical terms is that from now on during each redundancy or period of inactivity, a compulsory period of paid training should automatically begin, one that more than just fills a gap."
"We must translate the wishes of the Luxembourg Employment Summit in November 1997, where the 15 Member States decided that it was a priority to ensure that no young person was out of work or without training for more than six months, and no adult for more than a year."
"We must bring this idea to life by going even further and proposing that throughout their lives people should alternate between working and training by moving from one to the other without any unwanted breaks, that is, without any periods of unemployment."
"This would be a really major project that would allow Europe to get back in touch with its past, when it used to initiate social progress."
"It could be financed through the FRF 2 300 billion devoted every year in Europe to combating unemployment and through the European Structural Funds, which would better serve this objective if less fragmented."
"Mr President, the latest statistics show a fall in unemployment."
"On closer study, however, we see that unemployment has fallen to a lesser degree than the economy has grown in the same period."
"The fact that 23 million European citizens are living at subsistence level also gives cause for thought, as does the fact that the present report warns of low-pay and low-quality jobs and demands that monetary stability be maintained."
"The Luxembourg Summit's guidelines for a successful employment policy are ambitious."
"No one will seriously oppose alternatives to taxation on labour or measures to improve the climate for investment or education and training."
"But these formulas are not new, after all."
"Precisely these measures were discussed at the Essen Summit in the context of the White Paper on employment."
"However, it is sobering that the NAPs for employment are so unspecific about these measures."
"Many National Action Plans do not fix any concrete aims or financial resources, or else they are inadequate."
"What is needed are appropriate indicators, specification of budgetary funds and laying down of priorities and the deadlines for achieving them."
"And how are we to evaluate honestly the progress and results of employment policy?"
"I have to say that I hear the message but I do not believe it if the Member States fail to realise the objectives."
"Mr President, I should like to agree with those honourable Members who have said that the process begun in Luxembourg is a good thing but that Vienna will of course have to move things forward emphatically."
"I should like to focus on one aspect, Commissioner, which is extremely important to me."
"It is time Member States restored the link between more work and more equal opportunities for women."
"In the van Velzen report we firmly advocate a halving of the gender gap."
"This requires a particular commitment on the part of Member States for all the guidelines, and it also represents a commitment to positive action."
"Let me give you a few examples: it looks at the fact that more women are unemployed and for longer, and it is good, Commissioner, that the Member States have opted for action to prevent long-term unemployment."
"But that means too that women must get at least their fair share of any benefit from such measures."
"It means too that Member States must not be allowed, as they now do, to ignore long-term unemployment, where women are over-represented."
"No, the two things have to go together and complement each other."
"Secondly, we also want a clear commitment to more training opportunities for people currently in work."
"I think it is disgraceful that women working part-time are quite simply excluded from the opportunities offered under most of the training programmes laid on by employers."
"Thirdly, it presupposes extra attention in wage bargaining for the unacceptable differential of 20 to 30 % which still persists between male and female earnings."
"The result of this would have to be that any increases agreed in wage negotiations were now applied primarily to women's earnings, which are undervalued."
"It also presupposes that Member States will not remain obsessed with part-time work, but will talk about more family-friendly forms of work sharing and shorter working hours such as a four-day week, for example."
"We should like to see the Commission coming up with a further proposal to tighten the existing directive on working time."
"Lastly, Mr President, the preparation of concrete objectives has already proved its worth."
"We must intensify this process for all guidelines, and my group would like to make an important request for the Commission to address with urgency the question of benchmarks for the efficacy of social protection."
"We must ensure that more work also means better quality work and thus an adequate level of social protection."
"Mr President, I should like to express more than the conventional expressions of gratitude to the rapporteur, and also to put forward four ideas that would, in my view, enrich the report."
"Firstly, I regret the lack of any reference to the coordination of economic policies with monetary policy, that is to say, of the Economy and Finance Council with the European Central Bank."
"Recent publications, particularly Krugmann's work, are beginning to call into question whether it is logical and coherent to continue giving priority to price stability now that we have reached all-time low levels where job creation is concerned."
"Although I agree with Carlos Gasòliba that economic stability is a prerequisite for job creation, I also believe that greater coordination is needed and that the European Central Bank should focus more on this objective."
"Secondly, I think it is unfortunate that when comparing - benchmarking - job creation in Europe and in the United States, the experience gained by this Parliament was not drawn upon."
"Apart from some ideas reiterated in this House by a number of speakers - flexibility and the liberalisation of certain markets, particularly the service market and the labour market -, the report emphasised that one of the main reasons why the United States takes the lead where job creation is concerned is that it is far more committed to research and development. Also, private initiative plays a much greater part in that joint effort and there is an option of encouraging R&D through tax incentives rather than direct aid, thus linking projects to making a profit."
"Thirdly, with regard to the tax burden, there is reference to VAT on labour-intensive services."
"It seems to me that the time has come to ask ourselves whether it makes sense to maintain a value added tax such as the one devised in 1967 when there was a shortage of labour in Europe, and jobs remained unfilled. It might well be appropriate to consider whether it is still reasonable to allow immediate deduction of the tax on investment goods thus encouraging the replacement of workers by capital goods."
"My concluding remark is that I agree with the references to trans-European networks, but it is time to move on and say how we intend to finance them: from surplus reserves, issuing loans or in some other way."
"Mr President, as documented in Mr van Velzen's report, it seems to have been established that there is no direct connection between economic prosperity and job creation."
"Jobs have been created, but not enough of them. Social conditions in Europe have also failed to improve: 15 % of workers live below the poverty line."
"The much-heralded monetary union, the 'euro-umbrella' meant to protect Europe from the economic and financial ups and downs of the outside world does not seem likely to prevent some of their effects reaching our continent."
"We therefore feel that certain aspects of Mr van Velzen's report deserve to be highlighted."
"Firstly, there is a reference to the obsession with the concept of stability, the strict stability plan that has to be complied with."
"We believe that such an obsession should be done away with. What is of crucial importance now is the creation of employment if we also want the economy to do well."
"This stability plan is more concerned with monetary stability than with the stability of employment."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to stress the importance of two of the four pillars of the employment strategy: adaptability and equal opportunities."
"With regard to adaptability, the social partners must be involved when dealing with the working day and the reduction of overtime, amongst other issues."
"As for equal opportunities, we have repeatedly pointed out that women lag far behind men where access to work and salaries are concerned. This fourth pillar has turned out to be very weak in all the Member States' strategies."
"We must therefore encourage the creation of services to facilitate access to work for women and also their return to work following a career break."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, who has managed to home in on the fundamental issues concerning this key aspect of the economy - employment."
"He has done so at a time of uncertainty: there can be no doubt that the situation is now radically different from that described in the conclusions reached by the national governments in November 1997, both within the Community - which has since embarked on stage three of economic and monetary union and created the stability pact, with everything which that implies - and in the rest of the world, where there is no denying the serious changes that have taken place in the recent past."
"A recession is undoubtedly under way, affecting at least 40 % of the world's population, as the rapporteur himself has stated; so far, the storms have spared Europe and North America, but there are no guarantees as to the future."
"All in all, the growth rate in Europe is not keeping pace with the need for employment growth, and there is ground to be made up."
"We are convinced that the problem of unemployment cannot be solved through acts and decrees on employment: jobs cannot be created by decree; they are created by promoting economic growth."
"So efforts are required all round in order that such growth is stimulated by means of appropriate policies, above all fiscal ones, and through adequate support for economic development."
"Investment must therefore be as productive as possible, concentrated in areas where it can be used to best effect."
"Investment of a purely social nature would be ineffectual."
"I hope that this will be the approach adopted at the forthcoming Vienna summit, which Europe as a whole will be observing with keen interest."
"Mr van Velzen has indeed produced an excellent report, Mr President."
"It contains sound proposals, is in touch with reality, unpretentious and contains several innovative ideas."
"If I had to highlight one aspect of it, I would highlight the section devoted to the preventive approach."
"I hope and trust that this report will receive all possible support from Parliament."
"The European Union's millions of unemployed do not render this debate pointless - quite the contrary."
"In any case, thanks to this and other debates, employment is developing, albeit slowly, into a common policy that must be linked to economic policy, as coordination is essential."
"Unemployment leads to forms of exclusion, precariousness hampers personal development, and the lack of personal expectations places available labour in a feudal position in relation to whoever can provide a job."
"The authorities have the duty of ensuring that the principles of equality and solidarity are maintained where opportunities and income are concerned. However, they must also promote active policies and foster the basic conditions to relieve unemployment, the greatest concern of our societies."
"As stated in the report, the authorities must adopt economic policies that will strengthen or promote growth resulting from investment, generate consumer confidence and maintain domestic consumer demand."
"A much more determined effort by the authorities is called for to develop active policies on the labour market, and they should be prepared to take risks in dealing with the present situation."
"We shall continue to defend proposals providing both flexibility and security against the preservation of the concept of deregulation, which tends to be used as the key argument."
"Mr President, my compliments naturally go to the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen."
"His report tells us that, according to the data available, unemployment has actually fallen this year; however, we should not raise our hopes unduly, because the situation in Europe is only marginally positive."
"What is more, if we analyse the real situation in each individual Member State, we find wide divergences between the 15 countries."
"In Italy, for example, unemployment is still running at around 12 %."
"What remedies have we come up with?"
"A reduction in labour costs, naturally, and of course increased entrepreneurship, above all among SMEs."
"The importance of vocational training and qualifications has already been mentioned, so I shall not dwell on that point."
"I would merely stress one idea which is contained in the report and which I consider extremely important, namely that of reducing VAT on labour-intensive services."
"This proposal was put forward by the Council on 21 October 1997, and it could usefully be put back on the agenda."
"By the same token, an initiative could be taken by the European Investment Bank - which has expressed its readiness to do this - to finance projects at rates below the market rate, provided of course that such projects really are effective in generating employment."
"Furthermore, why not propose a review of the Central Bank's key role?"
"This new body, which came into being so as to keep down inflation within the 15 Member States, could and should have another important aim, namely to keep unemployment under control."
"Such a role is played in the United States by the Federal Reserve; its European counterpart should also undertake the vital task of keeping down unemployment."
"I believe that it is worth underlining the social relevance of the institutions which are being established."
"Mr President, the Commission's report is on employment in Europe in 1998."
"It is on the question of employment and not on the problem and the statistics of unemployment."
"Mr van Velzen, in particular, in the explanatory statement accompanying the motion for a resolution, has got close to and dealt well with this finer point of detail. In other words, we must make sure that we refer to the quality of employment, without calling into question the seriousness of the unemployment figures and the alarm that this causes."
"Some of the rapporteur's comments on the climate of economic recovery seem outdated because they no longer reflect the real situation."
"That is not his fault but the result of how the situation has developed."
"I would like to make one more comment, given the little time I have, about something that is not really that negative in itself, that is, the fact that the Commission has used the terminology of pillars in its report on employment."
"We would highlight the ambiguity, in particular, of the first pillar, that of employability, a concept that seems to hold the unemployed responsible for the very existence of unemployment because they are poorly qualified."
"This seems to take away the blame for unemployment from a social system that not only creates unemployment but also exploits it."
"Mr President, I too must thank the rapporteur very warmly for all his hard work and for the report he has put together for us in so short a time."
"It is not really possible to work in these conditions."
"Perhaps that explains his attack on our amendments."
"We were of course not happy with some parts of the report."
"We also abstained in the committee meeting."
"Consequently we felt obliged to retable the amendments on the points in question."
"That does not mean of course that all the compromises reached are lost."
"But we were in the extremely awkward position of having to make amendments on the basis of a report which did not yet exist."
"It just means we shall have to find another solution in future, though I appreciate that the rapporteur himself cannot do anything about it."
"As regards the subject itself: happily unemployment is slightly down for the first time, but that does not mean of course that this will continue to be the case in future."
"There are a few dark clouds on the horizon."
"So we must continue with the strategy we have started."
"I should say really that this strategy has been far more successful than anyone could have expected beforehand."
"There was a good deal of cynicism about this strategy, but it appears to work."
"It really seems to be leading to change in the Member States."
"Perhaps not enough change, but at least some."
"A number of things are now threatening, some of which are actually in Mr van Velzen's report."
"Paragraph 7 and the broad investment programme is something which we cannot accept, because it would take us back to the whole discussion on the overall strategy."
"We previously rejected this kind of broad investment programme, firstly because there is no money and, secondly, because it does not work at European level."
"It is hard for us to agree to it now, even if we do have eleven prime ministers in the European Union with a socialist background."
"It does not automatically mean that we are going to cough up."
"The second point I wanted to raise is the question of taxes."
"I think it quite proper that the rapporteur should ask for that to be addressed."
"It is a great shame that the debate on this, specifically variations in the rate of VAT, went totally awry in the Council and that governments which were supposedly in favour and are doing nothing else about it, and the one or two governments which were against, appear to be getting their own way."
"I think it is a great pity."
"I hope the European Parliament will manage to get the matter raised again."
"These are the main points."
"We may be able to back this provided we do not radically change it all of a sudden, and provided enough of our amendments are adopted."
"Mr President, it may well be that globally in the European Union there is a downturn in unemployment, though I do not know if it can be said that someone whose temperature has fallen from 41º to 40.5º can be said to be getting better."
"What I would like to quote as experience from my own country is that the phenomenon of unemployment is increasing, especially among young people and women, and this alongside and in parallel with Greece's desperate effort to meet the criteria for inclusion in economic and monetary union."
"From that standpoint I think we are getting to the heart of how to address the problem of unemployment today."
"A few years ago we had the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment."
"I do not know what its results were, perhaps there were some, but nothing came of all our discussions here and from the mobilisation in the European Parliament and in general."
"Today, however, I think that if we want to see some results from the positive ideas expressed by Mr van Velzen and from the efforts of Commissioner Flynn and the Commission to develop an overall unemployment strategy based on certain pillars, the course established by Maastricht will have to be changed."
"A change in the sense that social criteria and unemployment are included in progress towards EMU, investments are not counted among public deficits, and the European Central Bank at least follows the path pursued by the Federal Reserve in the United States."
"Mr President, first of all I think the strategy launched in Luxembourg is producing good results and will provide an impetus for structural changes in the European labour market."
"It is our expectation that the guidelines will be adjusted and tightened in Vienna so that the Member States have to give more specific commitments with quantified sums of expenditure."
"We expect the European Commission to improve its proposals accordingly."
"Secondly, there is no denying that the number of jobs rose by 750 000 in 1997 thanks to economic growth, economic growth which is now threatened by financial crises elsewhere in the world."
"Hence the need to underpin economic growth by a broad European programme of investment."
"There has been enough talking about the TENs. It is time now for clear decisions to be taken."
"Thirdly, I agree with those honourable Members who advocated a stronger presence in the jobs market for women, the over-fifties and the handicapped."
"Last of all, Mr President, it is a matter of great urgency to bring labour costs down."
"Mr President, though Europe's economy has in recent years been developing at relatively satisfactory rates - for example, in 1997 growth amounted to 2.7 % - we are not seeing a corresponding fall in unemployment."
"Unemployment has fallen, but by a small, an exceptionally small amount and in some countries it is at the same level or even increasing slightly, as in my own country."
"This means that growth on its own does not create as many jobs as we need."
"We also need structural measures in the labour market, and it is to this that we should turn our attention."
"Given that the problem of unemployment is a pan-European phenomenon, there must certainly be coordination between the policies of Member States to address the issue globally and effectively."
"The solution to the unemployment problem and the promotion of employment must become a truly European concern."
"It is important, however, that any such coordination should proceed along appropriate lines, because otherwise we could all be coordinated, all have the same policy, and end up by increasing unemployment."
"So here I should like to say - though this will provoke an allergic reaction in some colleagues - that we should look at what is happening in America and Japan."
"We do not have to ape the American or Japanese models, but let us look to see why they have lower unemployment and try to learn some lessons, just as we can learn something from some countries in the European Union where unemployment is already exceptionally low."
"I believe, then, that in this context there should be greater flexibility in the labour market, measures such as modernisation of the taxation and legal systems for employment, tax and other incentives for company investment, especially in the case of SMEs, completion of the internal market and easier movement of working people, flexible working hours, reduction of non-salary costs, the promotion of active employment policies and not just emphasis on the unemployment fund, and finally, utilisation of resources and potentials for education and higher education via the European Social Fund, which I feel could be much more effective than it currently is."
"I thank you, Mr van Velzen, for your report."
"It is a stimulating document, containing a thorough examination of the key problems of the European Union labour market, and it certainly it has a number of very good and interesting proposals for future action."
"A year ago I presented to Parliament the first set of employment guidelines."
"I am very pleased to inform you that we have achieved very considerable progress and success since then."
"All the Member States have lived up to the political commitments they made at Luxembourg last year."
"The Commission, in its draft joint report for 1998, has duly reflected this progress by making national employment policies more structured and transparent, for instance by reporting on concrete funding for the NEPs and on monitoring and evaluation structures."
"This progress is clearly in line with the proposals in Mr van Velzen's report."
"In particular I am pleased to see that the messages of prevention and activation as guiding principles for employment policy have penetrated the thinking of the national authorities and the social partners."
"Such principles have begun to be translated into concrete action, which the Member States have already started on this year."
"I recognise and welcome this progress."
"You all know that early intervention to prevent youth and long-term unemployment and the move from a curative to a preventative approach lie at the very heart of the strategy."
"This is the key point Mr van Velzen has been making - that we have to have a preventative approach."
"Concrete action has also been taken, for instance in reducing the number of young people leaving training and educational systems without adequate qualifications."
"This point is made very forcefully by Mr van Velzen and by Mr Thomas Mann and I agree wholeheartedly."
"You will notice, Mr van Velzen, that in our recommendation for the 1999 guidelines, life-long learning is a key issue for consideration at Vienna."
"What we are saying in the new guidelines is that we want to increase the number getting access to the labour market, in particular older workers."
"Not enough attention has been paid to that point and the report supports us on that."
"I should just draw your attention to a remark in the employment rates report, that high employment rates depend on educational attainment."
"That must be a key feature in the development of these policies by the Member States."
"We are talking about improving the environment for enterprise, encouraging and assisting business start-ups, coordination between the relevant authorities in the Member States, making the social partners more aware of their potential contribution, developing the adaptability pillar, introducing tax reforms to reduce the tax burden on labour, promoting greater awareness of the avoidance of gender segregation and facilitating access to the labour market for all."
"Here I would refer Mrs Van Lancker's comments on women in the labour market."
"In fact the employment rates report deals with this very point."
"I would just like to draw to your attention, Mrs Van Lancker, that equality is now a key element in our strategy."
"You will notice that we are not just talking about mainstreaming, we are talking about a horizontal issue and not just relying on the fourth pillar in support of your point."
"Your comments and those of the House have been taken fully into consideration."
"The draft joint report identifies these encouraging developments, but that is just the beginning and there is a long way to go."
"We need to involve the social partners more fully at all levels and to foster and develop a strong partnership approach at local level, promoting employment entrepreneurship and local economic development, especially in the services sector."
"I agree entirely with what Mrs Ojala said about the services sector."
"You will notice that in the employment rates report, where we draw the comparison between what happens in the United States and what happens in the European Union, the key issue is that we have not developed the services sector as they have done in the United States."
"In the European Union 39.2 % are employed in the services sector, in the United States it is 54 %."
"That is a big difference."
"We need to work out new options for lowering taxation on labour compatible with the overall macroeconomic strategy for stable growth and raising employment in the EMU, to devise and implement more concrete action to develop equal opportunities in our labour markets for women, disabled people and immigrants."
"Your report, Mr van Velzen, puts forward a wide range of suggestions for further developing the strategy."
"I think that is going to happen."
"The momentum is there."
"I am pleased to tell you that many of your proposals and ideas have already been taken on board in our proposal for 1999."
"You will see that reflected in the outcome of the Vienna Summit."
"In its proposal for employment guidelines for 1999 the Commission has sought to consolidate the political momentum that has been gained this year."
"You yourself said, Mr van Velzen, that there is a quiet revolution."
"I would like to think that it was not so quiet."
"But the momentum is there, the Member States have taken on the commitment and I believe that it is going to be very much strengthened after Vienna."
"In the interests of consistency and continuity, there are very few adjustments of substance in the 1999 proposal."
"It preserves the four pillar structure and the three Europe-wide operational targets."
"Nevertheless it incorporates the orientations of the European Council at Cardiff and it draws from the assessment of the 1998 joint employment report and the employment rates report for 1998."
"Some substantive additions and, in some cases, new guidelines aim at putting particular emphasis in 1999 on active measures: developing life-long learning, making the labour market more open to all, fully exploiting the jobs potential of the services sector and better reconciling work and family life."
"The Commission has also identified a number of horizontal issues."
"They include gender mainstreaming, the information society, undeclared work, the role of the structural funds, especially the social fund, local development and the need for improving common indicators and quantitative targets."
"Moving in this direction requires realism and ambition."
"Common targets require comparable statistics at European level and concrete action to improve the current state of such statistics will be proposed by the Commission in a specific report to the Vienna Summit."
"This year's revision of the guidelines is, however, a good opportunity to further develop this dimension of the strategy."
"The Commission has proposed a new target to be set individually by the Member States for increasing the number of workers benefiting from life-long learning."
"Furthermore, the Member States are invited to set concrete targets for other guidelines according to their national priorities and possibilities."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mrs Todini referred to the Community financing initiatives for the EIB and the EIF."
"I should just like to say that the EIB Edinburgh facility of the ECU 5b in loans to general infrastructure projects is ongoing."
"The Copenhagen SME facility is in place and the facility has been fully taken up."
"The growth and environment pilot project is in place for loans of perhaps ECU 1.6b."
"The EIF is authorised to commit up to 20 % of its own funds."
"The EIB's Amsterdam special action programme of ECU 1b to finance special action is also under way."
"We would be happy to discuss these at any time in the future."
"The 1999 joint employment report will for the first time attempt an evaluation of the impact of the NEPs."
"It will be a test for all of us."
"It is going to give the people of our Member States a tangible demonstration that we have moved from ideas to action and concrete results."
"So the quiet revolution, Mr Van Velzen, is taking on quite a political momentum."
"The strategy is there, we have targets, a timescale and a convergence policy."
"We need better implementation, but I think we will be successful."
"To start with, Commissioner, what a lucky fellow I am that everything I propose is already being planned by the Commission."
"But that is not the point I wish to make."
"You have heard a lot of speakers complaining here at the way in which we were obliged to prepare and amend this report."
"The reason for that is the ridiculously short time which the European Parliament was given."
"I would welcome the Commissioner's reaction to the suggestion which I make on this in paragraph 30 of my report."
"How does he think we can solve the problem in future?"
"Mr President, we are stuck in a very tight time frame to deal with all of this."
"Obviously, it is going to have to be considered further when the Treaty is ratified."
"I cannot really say at this time how we are going to fit all of this in."
"When you consider the reports coming next year in June - preparation for the Joint Annual Report, the Joint Employment Report - and meeting all the deadlines including the consultation report under the Treaty with Parliament later on, I cannot see yet how we are going to fit it in."
"Some new arrangement is going to have to be entered into between the institutions to enable us to meet the time-scale so that we can be ready for the December summit each year."
"We will have to consider how it is going to be done."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 p.m."
"Social action programme 1998-2000"
"The next item is the report (A4-0381/98) by Mr Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission: Social action programme 1998-2000 (COM(98)0259 - C4-0343/9)"
"The debate is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, I would like to briefly draw your attention and that of the House to the fact that the date change proposed by Amendment No 7 applies not only to Article 1(3) but also to Article 1(2)."
"It is the same date in both cases."
"This is only logical."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Mr President, I merely wish to make three remarks concerning the votes on the amendments."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 29 and 30, these have been resubmitted because the expression 'sperimentazione non interventistica ' in the Italian version is incomprehensible, and the addition of 'observational studies' enables research to be conducted in centres which carry out research for purposes other than the registration of medicinal products."
"Secondly, Amendment No 14 makes the wording of Article 7(2) incompatible with Article 7(3)."
"Amendment No 31 corrects this inconsistency without altering the spirit of Amendment No 14; I would therefore suggest voting on No 31 before No 14."
"Finally, should Amendment No 35 be adopted, it will cause No 17 to fall."
"However, I believe that it should be considered before Amendment No 16, in that it would also cause the last paragraph of No 16 to fall, where it says 'the sponsor shall notify the competent authorities at the time of taking those measures'."
"Mr President, my request is for the different language versions of Amendments Nos 1 and 10 to be brought into line."
"In committee we used the German text for the vote, and there I asked that the English version be aligned with it."
"Now, however, the original German version of the amendments has also been changed for presentation to the House."
"It is very important that we clarify that what we are voting on is what was adopted in committee in the original German version."
"The German term in question is 'gesetzlicher Vertreter '."
"It must be very clear that for individuals who are incapable of giving their informed consent, approval is given by their legal representative."
"If this is not clear in the English translation, the English version can be brought into line by saying 'legally responsible person', but nothing other than 'der gesetzliche Vertreter ' can be written in the German version, as this was used for the vote in committee."
"Mr President, as we are currently dealing with general remarks and so as not to interrupt the vote later, I should like to point out, with respect to Amendment No 7, that there is a discrepancy between some of the translations."
"When the term ' Doctor' is used in a general sense, colloquially, it ought to be understood to mean a medical doctor."
"There are of course also Doctors of Architecture, Chemistry, Engineering and so on."
"Mr President, as we decided in principle in Amendment No 28, which we adopted by a large majority, that research may only be carried out on persons incapable of giving informed consent if it is guaranteed that this is for his or her direct benefit, I request that we ask the Commission before the final vote what its opinion is on this amendment."
"I believe it will also be decisive for later votes, not only for the Commission and the Council but also for Parliament."
"Mr President, I merely wished to say thank you and to appeal to the Commission to show sensitivity."
"The overwhelming majority of this House has made certain requests, and I believe that such pressure must be taken into account."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I should like to clarify two points in connection with Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"Both of these relate to the reinsertion of text that was part of my document prior to the vote in committee."
"There is a significant difference between the two amendments, however."
"Amendment No 1 involves reinserting material that I myself deleted following a compromise reached with Mrs Wemheuer, the Socialist spokesperson."
"I would therefore ask the House to support this compromise, and recommend that they vote against the amendment."
"Amendment No 2 also involves the reinsertion of text into the report."
"In this case, however, the text concerned was deleted following the adoption of an amendment to delete it."
"So in this instance, the rapporteur's position is to recommend a free vote."
"Mr President, I would like to make a general comment to point out to you, since I am aware of how fond you are of procedural motions, that two groups have requested split votes on this text: the first has asked for 13 split votes, and the second has asked for 23 split votes."
"I would like to make it clear that the request does not come from our group."
"So you see that all the groups can make use of the rights they are granted by the Rules of Procedure."
"As regards what our rapporteur, Mr Fabra Vallés, has just said, I would point out that Amendment No 1 is an addition to the compromise text."
"It does not therefore contradict the compromise text that has been adopted in committee."
"Moreover, as regards Amendment No 2, it seems to me that, in the German version of the text, the verb 'prévient ' is not translated correctly. It appears that the German version uses the term 'stellt ', from the verb 'stellen ', when it should be 'warnt ', from the verb 'warnen '."
"I think that we should correct this version in line with the French text."
"Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"I would like to say that it was never my intention to suggest that your group is the only one to request split votes."
"Other groups ask for them as well."
"It sometimes happens that a slip of the tongue can give a false impression."
"Mr President, I have two minor comments."
"Firstly, you say that the Conference of Presidents has decided that this report cannot refer to Article 206, which means that the reference must be deleted from the motion for a resolution. Otherwise what would happen is that, although we are not voting by absolute majority as required under Article 206, the reference would still be made."
"Since Article 188c of the Treaty deals with precisely these matters, it should be included in the report."
"Secondly, I wish to highlight a linguistic problem in recital T. The French expression 'ladite enquête administrative ' has been translated into Italian as 'la cosiddetta indagine amministrativa ', whereby 'ladite ' has become 'soi-disant '."
"I would ask that the Italian version be corrected."
"Mr Dell'Alba, I have noted your comment."
"We will continue with the votes, and to avoid upsetting Mr Fabre-Aubrespy I will mention that this time, most of the separate votes were requested by the Socialist Group."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, if I could just ask you, on a point of order, whether it is within the rules or against the rules for Members to conduct lengthy telephone conversations on their mobile phones."
"Mr McMillan-Scott is doing so and I would like to draw that to your attention."
"Mr Evans, you are quite right."
"Other colleagues of mine and I too have repeatedly requested from this platform that when voting is in progress, telephone conversations should not be taking place on mobile phones."
"I do not know how urgent that telephone call was for Mr McMillan-Scott, but in cases of urgent need Members can leave the Chamber so that they are not on the phone while voting is in progress."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"This report proposes that Europol should have direct access to the customs information system."
"A federal police force, lacking any democratic accountability, has no attractions for me and I certainly cannot endorse granting it powers of this kind."
"For more detailed arguments, please refer to my explanation of vote on report A-0396/98."
"We thank Mr Schmid for producing such a thorough and pertinent report."
"Regulating Internet use is a sensitive matter, and it is necessary to proceed with extreme caution. The Internet facilitates global contact between individuals."
"Ideally, the flow of information should be unhindered and free from regulation. This report calls for a necessary degree of self-regulation, primarily in order to pre-empt exploitation of the Internet for criminal purposes, such as the dissemination of child pornography."
"The rapporteur's proposals complement the Commission's initial text. We particularly welcome the calls for European quality labelling and the approximation of substantive provisions in criminal law."
"Common definitions should prevent child pornography rings, for example, from exploiting differences in legislation in pursuit of their vile and degrading activities."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of an EU action plan to promote self-regulation, develop filtering and classification systems and encourage information activities and support measures."
"We are very much in favour of providing financial support for moves to restrict violence and pornography on the Internet."
"However, we have voted against a common European quality label awarded by the Commission."
"It is not the Commission's role to decide on the morality of material."
"We have also voted against harmonisation of civil and criminal law in the Member States."
"Legal practice in the Member States reflects the different national cultures and traditions in terms of what should be censored and how it should be punished."
"It is important to distinguish between what is illegal and what is offensive or damaging to morals."
"We need to have European cooperation to combat illegal material such as child pornography."
"In this area, we should extend the competence of Europol as soon as possible, so that we can combat international networks which produce, sell and distribute pornography of this kind."
"My reaction to the common position of the Council was one of ambivalence."
"On the one hand, I am glad that efforts are being made to counter 'pollution' of the Internet as effectively as possible."
"Cooperation between the Member States is altogether essential here."
"On the other hand, I remain very critical of the artificial, not to say spurious distinction generally made between 'illegal' and 'harmful' material."
"Child pornography is illegal, whilst adult pornography is merely harmful to children."
"But the appalling and abhorrent extent of sexual abuse against women and children ought to make us take a more realistic view of things."
"I voted for the amendment to develop a European 'quality-site label'."
"If we first have self-regulation on the part of service providers and personal responsibility on the part of Internet users, everything should be done to facilitate this."
"I did not support the proposed amendment to have legal questions ruled on at Community level."
"After all, the law varies from Member State to Member State in respect of the limits placed on freedom of expression. I think it would be a waste of energy trying to persuade the Council to change its mind on this."
"The development of the Internet has rapidly presented us with a difficult problem: how can we prevent this new means of communication from being used for unlawful purposes such as prostitution, paedophilia and the dissemination of theories or doctrines that do not respect human dignity, without establishing a system of censorship?"
"The only realistic method was to take action with the Internet providers."
"The Community action plan is based around this idea, particularly through codes of conduct developed by self-regulatory bodies."
"In this respect, the European Parliament had proposed, at first reading, the creation of a European quality label for suppliers of Internet services complying with these rules."
"The Commission did not adopt this idea and that is unfortunate."
"We therefore welcomed the fact that this amendment was tabled again."
"Finally, since the legal questions raised by the content or use of the Internet are difficult, the Council has reserved the possibility of issuing an invitation to tender in order to assess these difficulties."
"Parliament wishes to go further and to make this initiative compulsory so that these studies can begin immediately."
"The Council's position seems to be more sensible, and we should only undertake these studies if there truly is a need to do so."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that the same applies to the Internet as to all means of communication: it is the reflection of a civilisation, of a general state of mind."
"It is in some ways the mirror of our society, its tensions, its contradictions, its hedonism and its amorality, but also its creativity and the need to break the personal solitude and misery that the materialism and individualism of our time so often bring with them."
"If the images we receive over the Internet are not always pleasant, we should ask ourselves why."
"Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Amadeo report although I consider the report itself to be a very good one."
"I did this to protest against the fact that in particular the Group of the Party of European Socialists rejected Amendment No 36."
"The amendment is worded in such a way as to allow a type of disciplinary committee of the professional representation or a committee of the national professional representation to be convened in the event of a breach by the doctor conducting the trial."
"I believe that, where a problem arises, it is the right of doctors, who do so much for all of us, to have a professional representative that can be informed, make a case for and stand by the doctors."
"I regret this attitude of hostility towards doctors that is shown by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and I wished to protest against this by abstaining from the vote."
"'In Europe there is a diversity of cultural traditions. Equally, there is diversity in religious beliefs.'"
"That is what the European Commission says in its proposal for a directive on the introduction of good clinical practice. This pronouncement was an important starting-point for me in deciding where I stood on the clinical trials directive."
"Decisions on whether or not clinical trials are ethical are the province of the Member States, precisely because of this cultural and religious diversity."
"This is an important issue, and decisions on whether or not to authorise clinical trials cannot be taken just like that."
"Ethics committees can never carry as much authority as national governments."
"Moreover, each Member State has developed its own system for allowing or not allowing trials. The industry is familiar with them."
"They are afraid that a European directive will create a lack of clarity and thus an additional link in the chain of decision- making on clinical testing."
"In this way we are making the European market less attractive."
"These considerations prompted me, following the adoption of Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15, to vote against the report."
"We have today voted against the Amadeo report on the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use."
"We believe that the Member States themselves should be able to decide how to organise their health systems, and that there should be no harmonisation of health policy at EU level."
"We therefore cannot support the undermining of the Member States' competence in this area through an EU directive, or the undermining of national systems which work perfectly well because of a desire to lay down standards by law at EU level."
"We cannot vote in favour of a proposal which would mean increased bureaucracy and higher costs for existing national systems which already efficiently handle applications for the authorisation of trials of medicinal products for human use."
"However, we have decided to vote in favour of those amendments which deal solely with the protection of trial subjects and their rights."
"The report is far too vague about the procedures associated with applying to begin a clinical trial, and we do not think it is justifiable that the new ethics committees are exclusively able to authorise trials, without consulting the national authorities."
"The time limits set out in the report for communicating authorisations are unreasonably short, and mean that it is not possible to carry out a thorough assessment of the applications as is required."
"We therefore cannot support the proposal that clinical trials of medicinal products can be begun if authorisation has not been given by the expiry of the time limit."
"It is unacceptable to us that clinical trials of medicinal products for human use can be started under any circumstances without being directly authorised by the Member States, but simply once the authorities have been notified."
"The proposal will cause a reduction in the level of health protection in those cases where the Member States are obliged to give authorisation for trials on the basis of the time limits in the directive, even if the national authorities have still not completed a more thorough assessment of the application."
"We shall always oppose EU rules in the health sector which produce a lower level of health protection in the Member States in this way."
"As is quite rightly pointed out in the Commission's proposal for a directive, ethical principles reflect the culture, traditions and expectations of our peoples, and we also think that the Commission should respect these."
"We will not play a part in enabling the EU to harmonise national ethical judgements."
"We are grateful to the rapporteur for producing a good and thorough text."
"Given the transfrontier dimension of fraud and counterfeiting, there is a clear need for the countries of the Union to cooperate in combating such crime - especially when it comes to protecting the euro against counterfeiters."
"The report offers some imaginative suggestions as to how the Commission's proposal might be rendered more precise."
"As regards the role of Europol, we can support the relevant amendments for the specific purpose they are designed to serve: namely to combat fraud and the counterfeiting of means of payment."
"Given the emergence of electronic commerce that is developing on the Internet, the report by our colleague Gerhard Schmid has come at just the right time to warn us of the risks of fraud that we can already see growing."
"I believe that the text should enable us to limit the amount of fraud, even if it cannot put a stop to all attempted fraud on its own."
"Moreover, it is vital for the Member States to coordinate their judicial policies, for this type of crime will undoubtedly tend to develop on the global network."
"As it has done already."
"In this respect, we must speed up the talks we are holding with our partners in the framework of the WTO."
"It is not unreasonable to think that countries that are very conciliatory towards certain networks involved in serious crime might kindly welcome these new types of criminals."
"To fight them effectively, the international community must not only mobilise itself but must also have the means available to ensure that a minimum standard is applied in every country."
"It is indeed necessary to coordinate all those involved in these new means of payment, but we must also encourage the use of encryption in payment transactions."
"Equally, the use of credit cards at home can be made secure though the use of an individual terminal."
"The first trials in this respect seem encouraging."
"But there is a great deal yet to be done and time is moving on."
"We are not in favour of economic and monetary union and would rather it never came about. EMU signals a major political step in the direction of a 'Greater Europe'."
"Eleven out of the 15 Member States are more or less sure to go ahead, however, and we accept that the consequences will have to be dealt with as best as possible."
"This report deals with protecting the euro against counterfeiting, and we appreciate the need to introduce an effective system for pre-empting the forging of bank notes."
"Close cooperation between the national police authorities will be essential - and with Interpol, since the euro will also be circulating outside the eleven participating countries."
"We therefore see the logic of supporting this report, despite our fundamental disapproval of EMU as a political project."
"We are unable to support this report."
"We are opposed to harmonisation in the legal sector and see this report as the beginning of cooperation in the area of criminal law."
"Amongst other things, we are concerned at the proposal for a common European definition of what constitute criminal offences."
"The current differences in definitions are a reflection of differences in culture and legal traditions, and they should be maintained."
"We are also deeply concerned at the part of the proposal which relates to the Member States exchanging information on people who have been convicted of breaking the law in this area."
"The Commission document on which the report is based contains many sensible elements which respect the Member States' sovereignty in this area of criminal law."
"Unfortunately, this does not alter the fact that other parts of it may provide a basis for EU cooperation on criminal law being developed in the longer term, and we are opposed to this form of cooperation."
"Mr President, on behalf of the German delegation in the Group of the European People's Party, but also on behalf of the Austrian and some other delegations - for example, the Luxembourgish delegation - I would like to say that some of us voted against the Cederschiöld report and some abstained from the vote because it is our opinion that this report was rendered unacceptable by the adoption of the socialists' amendment on the introduction of voting rights for foreigners."
"The text contravenes our own constitution and the Treaties because we are exceeding our authority here, and it contravenes the constitutions of a number of Member States, such as Germany, that expressly prohibit it; it is a pity that this does such a disservice to the serious concerns expressed by Mrs Cederschiöld in her excellent report."
"We therefore felt obliged to vote against this report although we fully agree with the report's concerns."
"But we must reject the text of the amendment, which certainly does not belong in the report, as totally unacceptable."
"It is our opinion that it is basically unlawful because it is inconsistent with the legal system of the European Union and of a number of Member States."
"The need for joint action to combat and prevent organised crime cannot be overstated, and we welcome the Council's initiative in this field."
"The report from the committee responsible brings some useful improvements to the original text."
"The purpose of our explanation of vote is to express some reticence with regard to the rapporteur's paragraph 6."
"We find the wording somewhat infelicitous, since it would be inappropriate to seek to infringe the media's inalienable right to make independent judgements as to editorial content."
"The report by Mrs Cederschiöld on crime prevention is full of good intentions, and we can but say that it is unfortunate that the European Union is not paying more heed to them."
"It says, for example, that we need 'a strengthening of a sense of community' through the promotion of 'families, kindergartens, schools, churches and leisure associations'. We also need to encourage 'the absorption of laws and values in the family socialisation process' and, finally, we need to maintain a feeling of belonging to a neighbourhood so as to form a 'sense of local area', which will encourage citizens to feel responsible for what happens in their common area."
"All these intentions are excellent, and we can only regret the fact that the European Union is doing the contrary by trying to destabilise all communities, from the nation, through standardisation and integration, to the family, by fighting against discrimination on grounds of 'sexual orientation'."
"Similarly, we do not see how it could be possible to promote a sense of belonging to a local neighbourhood at a time when the European Union is advocating mobility on an international scale as the greatest of virtues and when it is establishing, moreover, all the policies that will mean that this is absolutely necessary in the future."
"However, we cannot support the section of the Cederschiöld report relating to immigrants, which has been made even worse by an amendment."
"It says that the European Parliament wishes to guarantee them 'the introduction of voting rights at communal level after a certain period of legal residence', according to the same conditions as apply for citizens of the European Union."
"We can see here a glimpse of the old idea promoted by certain federalist camps that nationals of third countries should have at least some of the rights of European citizens."
"We believe that those who wish to vote in a country, at whatever level, must apply for nationality of that country."
"They must share the destiny of a country - that is, hold its nationality - if they want to be involved in its decisions."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of this report on the prevention of organised crime."
"We have voted in favour of calling on the Member States to develop national programmes in the areas of job creation, health, education and social policy, and of improving the European cooperation which already exists in this sector."
"However, we believe that this report is somewhat superfluous."
"It is not particularly ambitious, and it is time that we proceeded instead with a practical and binding form of cooperation which really is capable of preventing organised crime."
"In principle I support all measures to combat organised crime, both repressive and preventive measures. The current scale of organised crime makes all conceivable initiatives necessary."
"Nevertheless, in my opinion the report goes beyond the stated aim, which is to draft guidelines and measures for the prevention of organised crime."
"In several points in paragraph 7, for example, measures to prevent organised crime are confused with measures to prevent small-scale crime."
"Apart from the fact that in my opinion it is not the task of the European Union to make such detailed statements on these issues, I also reject some points because of their content (the introduction of voting rights at local level for foreigners, giving priority to crime prevention projects in the context of the reform of the Structural Funds, attaching increased importance to alternative forms of reaction)."
"Despite this, I voted in favour of the report in the final vote because in my view the positive aspects outweigh the negative, and I would simply like to make it clear that this approval does not apply to all points."
"We cannot support the Cederschiöld report, even thoughwe fully sympathise with its view that combating crime does not just involve tackling the crime which currently exists, but also social prevention, for example."
"In this context, we can only deplore the adverse social effects of the EMU policy on large sections of the EU's population, while the convergence demands made on national budgets by EMU will indeed make it difficult for the Member States to carry through many of the sound proposals contained in the Cederschiöld report."
"We are voting in favour of all the report's good advice to the Member States, but we are strongly opposed to all those elements which point to EU harmonisation of this sector, whether now or in the future."
"This is a good report overall."
"Mrs Cederschiöld manages to come to grips with many of the problems connected with organised crime, but two important elements are missing."
"My first caveat is that no real account is given of the huge social problems underlying criminal behaviour."
"What we need is an analysis of the way in which greater divisions in society and mass unemployment are generating organised crime."
"The second shortcoming is a consequence of the first."
"Flawed premises lead to faulty conclusions, as we find on occasion in this report."
"Special reference is made to the importance of 'civil society' and the role of the individual in reducing organised crime."
"I have no faith in such an approach."
"Welfare and equality are the prerequisites for cutting crime."
"There are many good suggestions and interesting ideas in this report."
"The rapporteur fails nonetheless to mention the prime causes of both organised and non-organised crime: poverty, destitution, large income discrepancies and, of course, unemployment."
"In paragraph 7, she expresses the view that we can combat organised crime by encouraging 'voluntary service for social policy objectives and the communication of values through private socialisation' - by setting up kindergartens and schools, for example."
"Such things are always possible, but it would be far preferable to build up a strong public sector, financed by taxation and capable of offering the fundamental facilities of society to everyone."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Social action programme 1998-2000 (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mr Hughes on the communication from the Commission on the social action programme 1998-2000."
"Mr President, a model for political action in Europe is the market economy, or at least the social market economy."
"An element of the work of unification is cohesion, both economic and social."
"And the single market, which as a result of the euro will become the home market, will only be complete when this social dimension is in place. The Commission's Social Action Programme therefore has an important status even in principle, and not only for unemployed, excluded, disabled and disadvantaged persons."
"It creates the general conditions for new fields of responsibility in social policy, particularly in employment."
"For this reason it is particularly regrettable that it is only a medium-term strategy until 2000."
"The opportunity to make a longer-term arrangement until 2006 was missed, but this is what we need in view of EU enlargement and the rapidly changing age structure."
"Equal opportunities is one of the four pillars of the NAPs."
"The Commission mentions it only randomly, however, instead of devoting a chapter to it."
"Mainstreaming is not given sufficient attention either."
"It deserves more than lip-service and is too significant to be restricted to employment and social protection."
"Gender mainstreaming is relevant to health and safety at work, demography, new work organisation and other areas."
"We thank Stephen Hughes, the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for his excellent report."
"He has also accepted some of the demands of the Committee on Women's Rights, such as the directive on equal treatment between women and men in social security schemes, the social protection statute for assisting spouses and the evaluation reports on the health and safety of pregnant women and on equal pay for work of equal value."
"We were able to integrate other issues into the report on Leonardo and the report on the European Structural Funds."
"We call upon the Commission to take the initiative in the following areas: child care in the Member States, improved access for women to education, and the provision of new information on the situation of women in the applicant countries, both on the labour market and in society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would firstly like to thank Stephen Hughes for his report, which is a good and balanced one, as we have come to expect from him."
"The Commission communication, however, contains an assortment of good ideas that have been put into practice but only very modest plans for the future."
"The large discrepancy between Annex I and Annex II is perhaps symptomatic of this."
"The debate about the new Social Action Programme is taking place in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty; this means that the new instruments - the employment chapter, the Protocol on Social Policy, Article 13 on anti-discrimination and the instrument of social dialogue - should in future ensure a new quality for Europe's social policy."
"However, when I consider the Commission plans I am very sceptical."
"They contain too many non-binding measures instead of new proposals to expand European legislation."
"The consequences of European monetary union, of the euro and of enlargement to the east, on which our committee has often asked for information, are not mentioned."
"Coordination of the guidelines and economic policy is imprecise and non-binding."
"Two of the three main areas are also absolutely inadequate."
"We consider the participation of workers to be relevant to the subject of the world of work in relation to modernisation, but at the moment it seems that the debate on information and consultation of workers has disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle of the Council."
"The second area is that of exclusion."
"Citizens have lost a great deal of faith in us due to the irresponsible behaviour of the Council of Ministers in this area, and incidentally the poverty reports demanded by Parliament are not mentioned."
"The third area is that of jobs and mobility, and here I must in fact praise the Commission."
"Many points have already been discussed this morning in the context of the van Velzen report."
"However, the courageous decision made by the Commission on the issue of free movement was the right one."
"If you continue in this way, including in other legislation, you will be able to count on the support of our committee and my group."
"Mr President, I too must thank Mr Hughes very sincerely for all the work he has put into this actually quite slim report."
"I think we have a new process here."
"He has said as much himself this morning, a new process in our cooperation with the Commission, namely that we look first at what an action programme of this kind might contain and then pass it over to the Commission, which then shapes it into an action programme of its own or at least adopts it as one element of its own programme."
"I think it has worked well."
"And I do not think there are too many problems."
"We have one amendment concerning a relatively minor detail."
"So there are no differences of opinion as far as the main substance of the report is concerned."
"I agree really with Mrs Weiler that the Commission's proposals are somewhat on the lean side, that there is not all that much to them."
"This brings us really to the only major difference we have with the European Commission, namely the time frame we have for this action programme."
"The time frame, which is above all limited to what is covered by the current mandate of the Commission, is too short."
"We cannot know exactly when the Amsterdam Treaty will come into force."
"We know the Amsterdam Treaty creates many new opportunities precisely in the very sensitive and important area of social and employment policy."
"That has not really been taken into account."
"What makes no sense, and what I want to ask the Commissioner, is this: how can it be that the Commission has very far-reaching plans with regard to Agenda 2000, so far-reaching that it is virtually impossible for the Council to agree them, but that in this relatively simple, straightforward area it refuses to go beyond its own mandate?"
"I think these things are very hard to reconcile, because social policy will be important not only within the European Union of today, but also in our dealings with the new states which will be joining the European Union early in the next millennium."
"And unless we have our house in order, unless we have clearly established what constitutes the acquis communautaire , we shall have a lot of problems."
"Those problems could be greater than the problems in all the other areas which we cover in such breadth."
"So this is a missed opportunity."
"I would actually have been far happier if the Commission had gone along with what we suggested, namely working to a longer time scale."
"Then we could take the Amsterdam Treaty fully on board, and if we did that we should advance a little further in the social field and show the public some results from our social and employment policy, not just what has been achieved already, but what is likely to be achieved soon."
"Mr President, let me begin by stressing how important it is that jobs and employment policy are now to receive the treatment they deserve at EU level. European cooperation has too long been dominated by competition, the market, trade policy and so on."
"There is, however, a problem."
"Perhaps I will not have my whole group behind me in what I am about to say, but I am not convinced that EMU is the way forward on jobs."
"An abiding anti-inflationary strategy - in the current climate of low inflation throughout most of Europe - could in fact cause more problems than it solves on the employment front."
"I feel that we should be looking for alternative ways of improving the unemployment situation, focusing on an interplay between economic and employment policy."
"The social dialogue, social policy cooperation and the action programme are important instruments for highlighting political issues and analysing problems. We need all this in order to understand the causes of exclusion, poverty, unemployment, discrimination and globalisation."
"My position possibly differs somewhat from the general committee view in this respect."
"I would tend more towards supporting the Commission's approach."
"Many of us in my group feel that these are matters to be dealt with primarily by the individual Member States."
"Decisions on the rights of individuals belong within the realm of domestic policy."
"Furthermore, I believe that partnership, mutual support, positive incentives and setting a good example count for just as much as Europe-wide legislation."
"Provided all these elements are handled properly, equally good results can be achieved."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the chairman of our committee on this important report and echo his support for the Commission communication on this new social action programme that presents significant new areas for intervention."
"I would like to say that I agree with and I thank the rapporteur for proposing the inclusion of a bill of rights at the next revision of the Treaties, as requested by many associations as well as our fellow citizens."
"I can tell you that the President of France at least is very much in favour of this as part of refocusing the Treaties and the necessary changes to the institutional set-up of the Union for enlargement."
"I would also like to emphasise how important we feel it is to promote every aspect of the social dialogue and European civil dialogue."
"This is the way to make those taking part in social dialogue more representative, particularly the SMEs which account for more than 66 % of all jobs in France today."
"I would like to emphasise another aspect of participation."
"I am referring here, Commissioner, to participation in the profits and results of companies, particularly in its most perfect form, that is, employee share ownership."
"This is not mentioned in the social action programme despite the fact that its development seems to me to be an important element in modernising labour relations."
"That is why I am calling on the Commission to encourage the development of this form of participation, which is both beneficial to the competitiveness of companies and fulfilling for employees."
"Those are the few comments I wanted to make on behalf of the UPE Group on this important report."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank our committee chairman for all the work he has put into this report."
"He has my support in his criticism of the fact that the action plan will cover only three years and not run the full five to 2006, as originally envisaged."
"Forward planning and a long-term perspective are essential here."
"I am also a little disappointed that the civil dialogue, which we well and truly need, was deemed to be dispensable."
"The Commission appears content with the European social policy forums held every other year, although these are far from adequate."
"It is a great pity that neither home working nor the general issue of equal opportunities are included in the action plan. An amendment from my group seeks to remedy this."
"I do not share the rapporteur's disappointment over the Commission's proposal for greater resort to 'soft law'."
"This is an acceptable way forward, preferably in combination with commitment to the civil dialogue."
"Mr President, when I read the Commission's Social Action Programme 1998-2000 and the Hughes report on it, an expression which is often used in Denmark came to mind: this is the thin end of the wedge."
"Well, the fact is that when someone says 'A' in the European Union, it is not long before the whole alphabet has been used."
"This is also clearly illustrated by this report, as when the rapporteur states that there is a need for an action programme which is 'more explicitly a political document rather than simply a list of intended actions'."
"And when a concept like 'the European social model' is used from time to time, then in my view we have taken far too many steps in the wrong direction."
"Because what is the European social model?"
"It does not exist in reality, although it certainly does in the imaginations of most of the Members of Parliament."
"That does nothing to make it any more real, however."
"There is a huge gulf between fantasy and reality in this system, and everyone should face that fact before the next step is taken."
"Think of the people out there in the Member States who cannot identify with the fantasy world of the EU, and who in many ways have hardly any idea of what is going on down here."
"There are great differences between north and south in the EU, and these are both cultural and economic."
"For example, there is a major difference in terms of women's participation in the labour market and as regards the provision of care for children and the elderly."
"There is a different basis for social policy in the individual countries."
"In some, it is largely geared to families and private schemes, whereas in others it is based on the public sector."
"In Denmark and the rest of Scandinavia, the dominant principle is that of solidarity - and continues to be, I have to say."
"But we are seeing in Denmark too how things are changing towards a more personal system, in which it is up to individuals to save and take out insurance for themselves."
"This is a new and not particularly welcome trend, in my opinion."
"It is also one which has not just taken place because the majority of the population want it, but also because Denmark is a member of the EU and is therefore trying to approximate Danish social policy to the concept referred to as the European social model."
"This is a foolish and mistaken development, and one which is dangerous for democracy in our individual countries."
"It is stated in the Commission's proposal and in the report that the introduction of the European social model is important in relation to the internal market and EMU."
"I refuse to accept a social principle which is based on the principles of the internal market, where it is reasons of competition which determine what kind of social policy is pursued."
"That does not imply any particular kind of solidarity."
"And in conclusion, I would say that it must continue to be the individual Member States that decide for themselves what kind of social policy they wish to pursue in their countries."
"Mr President, I wish to join with the others in congratulating the rapporteur."
"I also welcome Commissioner Flynn, who has been unstinting in his efforts to encourage a very close dialogue between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Commission in this area."
"Turning to the Hughes report and to the future of the social action programme, I should like to make a few brief comments."
"At a time of unprecedented political change in Europe, we should not only consolidate but also strengthen the social dimension and update it for the next century."
"We face three tremendous challenges in the European Union at the moment: the advent of economic and monetary union, enlargement and the policy to combat large-scale unemployment."
"When we add this to the demographic trends within the European Union, global economic change and technological innovation, we can see that we are facing considerable challenges."
"I agree with Bartho Pronk and Barbara Weiler that it is regrettable the Commission has only really planned for an action programme up to the year 2000, which is just over 18 months away."
"We need something longer term, particularly as the Amsterdam Treaty - which has not yet been ratified in all the Member States - will have greater powers in the social area than any previous Treaty."
"The social action programme should form the heart of Europe's social policy agenda."
"Like everyone else, I welcome the Commission's emphasis on employment creation but this is not only a panacea for the European Union."
"We need to strive to develop policies to help people who are unemployed, excluded or less fortunate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hughes report that we are debating today, welcoming the Commission's new social action programme, makes such major changes that it virtually transforms the subject into a debate on the European social policy in its broadest sense."
"Creating a genuine European welfare society, with an improved quality of life and strong social cohesion, calls for the drafting and subsequent implementation, in practical and objective terms, of a political document reflecting the new status of a European Union social and employment policy, something that has already been acknowledged."
"Regrettably, instead of covering a longer period, 1998-2006, the timetable has been limited to 1998-2000, hampering the issues of employment and other social matters in Community policy."
"The European Union's new economic framework, resulting from the completion of the Single Market and the new monetary policy, which is about to come into effect, makes interaction between economic policy and social policy all the more important and accentuates the need to consolidate relations between EMU, the Single Market, the cohesion policy and effective social and employment policies."
"The new social action programme, as a strong component of a European social policy, should be taken on board by all the European institutions, by the Member States and by the social partners, stressing the importance of more objective and decisive ways of bringing about civil dialogue in the future."
"The report emphasises the need to strengthen the existing legislative framework, particularly in the areas of labour organisation, workers' individual and collective rights and social measures aimed at regulating a free market economy."
"However, we should not neglect legal arrangements for tackling serious problems lingering as a consequence of demographic trends, racism, poverty and social exclusion, for example."
"This report has our support since, in our view, it should lead on to new and far-reaching discussions about the future of European social policy."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mr Hughes, has produced an excellent report."
"We in the Green Group would like to make one or two changes touching on the issue of equality between women and men."
"I believe that it would be a good thing if the report were to emphasise that the issue of equality should be incorporated in all social policy, with particular emphasis on mainstreaming."
"We would also like Parliament to remind everyone of the importance of childcare, without which equality between women and men will make no progress whatsoever."
"We know that Mr Flynn has made enormous efforts here, and we would like Parliament to support him in this."
"Finally, we should remember that we are in the middle of the enlargement process and we have to be concerned when we see how badly applicant countries perform in the area of equality between women and men."
"We would like this to be emphasised in the enlargement negotiations."
"Mr President, when you look at a report, it is important to realise that you have to read what it actually says."
"My Danish colleague from the movement of permanent discontent evidently had some difficulty with that."
"However, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Hughes on what is a very fine report."
"It focuses on the challenges that we are facing in labour market policy over the coming years."
"The new social action programme is different from the previous action programmes in that it does not contain any specific proposals for directives on such things as the working environment and social protection."
"I think it is a pity that the action programme does not include some more specific proposals on the working environment."
"We do still need to improve matters there."
"On the whole, the new programme is an excellent basis for the EU's social and labour market policy in the next few years."
"There are some shortcomings, for example the fact that the Commission does not mention home workers."
"I am therefore pleased that we are calling on the Commission to take action in this area."
"We should ensure that the seven million people in the Community who work at home are not treated in an inferior way to the rest of the labour market."
"We should also be calling on the Commission to ensure that the existing directives also cover home workers."
"The section dealing with employment could also have been a little more ambitious."
"We should not just shift jobs around between the Member States."
"That will not bring many people into work."
"Some Member States have unfortunately used the trick of enticing businesses to their country with offers of tax exemptions and low corporation tax."
"The Commission should therefore act to set a minimum rate for corporation tax."
"Work is currently being done on drawing up a code of conduct for business taxation."
"That is not enough."
"We must have binding rules in this sector."
"So there is a need for a more ambitious and binding form of cooperation on social and labour market policy for the future."
"Mr President, the new social action programme for 1998-2000 proposed by the Commission is securely based on the guidelines for employment as agreed at the European Councils of Amsterdam and Luxembourg."
"However, the proposals could certainly have been more daring."
"For example, there should be more active participation by working people in the decision-making process in companies, and the rights of their representatives should be amplified."
"But a special approach is also needed for small and medium-sized enterprises, which takes account of their special features and needs."
"The Commission also ought to clarify the way in which it means to exploit the potential offered by the new legal base in the area of social protection."
"In addition, preparatory work should begin straight away on action programmes against social discrimination and to promote social access, and I wish to stress in particular the care we must devote to people with special needs."
"We must make sure that in directives concerning public contracts it will be compulsory to conform with current social legislation."
"Finally, I cannot but agree with the rapporteur that the Commission should have chosen the period 1998-2006 and not the very brief span of 1998-2000 which it ultimately selected, since the former would have reinforced the basic role of employment and social affairs in the Union's policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by saying that I regard this present debate on the excellent report by Mr Hughes as a very important symbolic debate."
"The rapporteur and Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sets out in his explanatory statement the entire history of this contact and cooperation with the Commission, and the entire history of its development following the progress in Amsterdam and at the special conference in Luxembourg."
"We in the European Union are today facing a new reality which finally accepts and recognises that employment and social policy are the first priority in Europe, and I think the social action programme which the Commission has proposed, Commissioner, is an important step forward."
"It is indeed a policy document of great weight for the European Union."
"I think this must be followed up, and I stress that the emphasis placed on dialogue with the civil society in various forums is extremely important, though more important still is social dialogue with the social partners, which is of course not just a fashion which has had its day."
"Last Saturday a very important event took place in Athens at which Mr Delors was present, and he repeated that what Europe needs is precisely to highlight the value of social justice and solidarity."
"I believe that for us too, this ought to form the basis which gives the European Union, our Europe, fresh impetus and brings our vision to fruition."
"Mr President, I would like to comment further on the van Velzen report in the light of this morning's debate."
"Employment continues to be first and foremost a task for the Member States."
"Guidelines and coordination are useful and good, and I too hope that they will allow us to promote and develop employment."
"But we must be careful not to do as we did this morning and talk as though we alone at EU level are capable of solving the problem of unemployment."
"By doing so we are merely giving the relevant national politicians the opportunity to pass the buck to the EU or the European Central Bank if national labour market policy fails."
"Incidentally, calling the Stability Pact into question has the effect of threatening employment rather than promoting it."
"I call upon the Commission to give greater prominence to updating minimum social standards in the Social Action Programme 1998-2000."
"A fundamental aim of European social policy is to develop a European framework of social legislation that guarantees a common basis of binding and enforceable minimum social standards, which does not demand too much of weaker states and does not prevent more developed economies from maintaining or improving their social standards."
"At least, this is what I have been told, Commissioner."
"However, those countries which are weaker in economic terms have made progress since minimum standards were established, which is why I would repeat that the further development of minimum social standards must be seriously taken in hand."
"Existing gaps, such as the inclusion of homeworking, teleworking and contract workers, and the reinforcement of information, consultation and participation procedures, must be dealt with by introducing new directives."
"These gaps must be closed."
"I would also like to comment on the social dialogue."
"I support Mr Peter's demand that the social dialogue must be placed on a broader basis of organisations, and despite your optimism, Commissioner, the results of the social dialogue have so far been disappointing."
"In my opinion there is a great deal to be done, and if need be we must put the situation right by means of directives."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Hughes for his report and all those who stayed and contributed to the debate."
"I look on the report as being very supportive of the Commission Social Action Programme."
"As Mr Hughes says, the programme reflects very valuable prior input from himself and his colleagues."
"This has been very favourably reported upon by many who contributed."
"For the record I should like to say that, from the Commission's perspective, the constructive way we have worked together to develop this programme was quite exemplary and has brought us a long way in the development of the relationship between the Commission and Parliament."
"The Social Action Programme 1998-2000 adopted by the Commission on 29 April provides a strategic overview of how we see the key priorities for the future development of European social policy."
"Indeed, European citizens want a very strong, dynamic and forward-looking social policy and this programme provides a framework within which all of that can be achieved."
"The programme responds to the very significant potential of the new Amsterdam Treaty in the social field."
"The programme places employment - as Mr Hughes quite rightly says - at the very centre of social policy, drawing out the complementarity between the new European employment strategy and the broader social policy agenda."
"Employment is the principal means by which we can deal with many social problems and sustain the core values of the European social model."
"Social protection systems - work regulation, health and safety provisions - are productive factors helping to improve economic performance as well as ensuring a fair sharing of the benefits of that performance."
"We have already gone a long way in implementing the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in the field of employment."
"Although much remains to be done to meet the expectations of our citizens, there are signs that our employment strategy is proving to be a success story."
"Within a very short time Member States have engaged in a process to make their employment strategy systematic, consistent and quite transparent."
"There is the opportunity for the Heads of State to move further at the Vienna Council and thereafter in their internal budget decisions."
"While employment is central to our vision the programme goes beyond the labour market."
"It sets out a balanced, ambitious and forward-looking vision of social policy as an essential element of the next challenging phase of European integration."
"I am more than happy to make a commitment here to come back to report regularly on the implementation of the programme and to maintain the collaborative approach we have followed so far which has proved so useful in the development of the whole of European social policy."
"The Commission is already preparing for the implementation of the other provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty as soon as it is ratified."
"I will be looking for Parliament's support to develop this new and exciting part of the agenda."
"I should like to say a few words about the debate held in the Council on 27 October on the social action programme."
"It was quite encouraging and I took note of several messages which came from the Council at that meeting."
"Firstly, there was explicit support for our approach as set out and reconfirmation that employment is Europe's top priority."
"Enlargement was very strongly signalled as a key issue."
"I believe that Member States would like social policy to have more emphasis in our enlargement discussions and I expect that will be the case."
"I can report that the spirit of Amsterdam is very much alive."
"I was particularly heartened by the encouragement to table proposals in the area of anti-discrimination under Article 13."
"There was a strong message from the Social Affairs Council as to the necessity of strengthening social dialogue."
"I will not hide from you that social dialogue has a long way to go."
"We have made some progress but it has been rather limited and I am going to have to work on that a little harder with the social partners."
"I will now reply to some points which seem to be causing concern."
"Some Members asked why, so far as the programme is concerned, the time span is not longer."
"Let us be clear."
"There will certainly be a need for a new social action programme post-2000."
"But by then we will be a lot clearer on many of the major issues we are talking about, for example developments in globalisation, in particular the social impact of economic and monetary union."
"The potential that exists from the new Treaty will be clearer to us then."
"We will have advanced a little in the negotiations on enlargement and we will be better able to focus on the key issues there."
"There will be the impact of the employment strategy."
"We will have progressed further in the whole evaluation of the national action plans and then we will be in a better position to get a longer term view for the next programme."
"As honourable Members have said, social policy is changing and there will be a new focus particularly when the Treaty is ratified."
"The strategy with regard to employment will be advanced as well."
"Mrs Schörling put it very well when she said that we are taking the first steps in order to take further steps."
"It is a good way of looking at the whole matter."
"There is a lot to do and I would suggest that the House is going to be extremely busy between now and the end of this Commission and this Parliament in dealing both with the legislative programmes that are now coming on-stream and also the non-legislative actions."
"Social policy is an ongoing process and our evaluation will help us to develop it better as time goes on."
"Mr Hughes made it contingent on his support that certain matters would be replied to so I will make a few further remarks."
"On the civil dialogue we did not get what we had hoped for from the Treaty."
"However, we will be publishing the outcome from the Social Forum quite soon."
"We have a budget line to do all this in 1999 so we are going to continue to develop it."
"On preparatory actions for Articles 13 and 137, you will be pleased to hear that work is well under way."
"In fact, we issued a call for tenders to prepare for Article 137 in September so we are moving ahead nicely there."
"On health and safety staffing, we now have the agency in Bilbao and I am trying to divide up the work in a more even-handed way so that we will continue to get the best results possible."
"Remarks were made by Mr Hughes on social protection and the framework of investment."
"Our plan contains three elements."
"In a matter of weeks we will publish a review of the 1992 recommendation on minimum income support schemes within the social welfare systems and next year we will publish a new communication on the future of social protection."
"We had two previous texts there in 1995 and 1997 but it is important that we do it again."
"As we set out in the Action Programme we want to use Article 137 to develop a framework for national policies, including social protection systems to work against social exclusion."
"The issue of sexual harassment was also raised."
"I agree that the question of sexual harassment is a real problem."
"I will soon be able to give you two studies concerning sexual harassment and its prevalence in organisations in all of the surveyed countries in the European Union."
"It is my assessment that the majority of the Member States are, at the moment, not interested in legislation."
"As you know, the social partners could not come to an agreement on the matter either, so I am in a bit of a dilemma there."
"I would like to ask your indulgence to reflect further upon this."
"Perhaps after the two studies have been published we can talk about it again."
"Insofar as stress, as a health and safety matter to be examined is concerned, there is no problem."
"It is already explicitly mentioned on page 9 of the mid-term report on Community programmes concerning safety, hygiene and health at work."
"As far as home workers are concerned I should like to tell the House that the Commission will be adopting a communication on modernising the organisation of work."
"We hope to do that on 25 November."
"This is a framework document that will give the social partners and others an opportunity to comment on how we should now proceed with all of the organisation of work issues."
"I can tell you, Mr Hughes, that home working will be included in that matter."
"You also mentioned the question about a directive on equal treatment and social security in 1998."
"Our programme has a commitment to do that in 1999 and work is in progress which is well advanced now."
"We have not discussed it yet at Commission-level, but it is quite well advanced."
"Regarding the question of implementation of the pregnant workers directive, the report is presently being drafted on that particular issue."
"It may be adopted by the end of the year."
"I should like to say to Mrs Hautala that there will be a communication by the end of December, if possible, but certainly sometime before the middle of January, on the question of the external aspects of social policy."
"That will include enlargement."
"We have an awful lot of work to do between now and the end of next year."
"Certainly, in my opinion, social policy has moved on quite dramatically."
"We will be extremely busy with legislation, where a number of points are pending, and on non-legislative matters, together with the whole employment strategy."
"I ask for your support for the plan."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Social dialogue"
"The next item is the report (A4-0392/98) by Mr Peter, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission: Adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level."
"Mr President, allow me firstly to raise a technical point."
"My attention has been drawn to the fact that in recital D of the Swedish version of this report there is a translation error which distorts the meaning."
"I would ask you to have this checked."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of coherence of economic and social development is enshrined in the Treaties."
"The Commission's clear remit to promote social dialogue, the European Social Charter, the Agreement on Social Policy which has now been incorporated into the Amsterdam Treaty, the employment chapter in this Treaty and not least the effects of imminent monetary union give the social dialogue greater significance than ever before."
"It is consensus rather than conflict that remains at the heart of the social dialogue."
"Where the social partners have completely different interests, a major factor in determining their ability to reach agreement will be whether they carry equal weight."
"It is essential that the individual organisations prove that they are representative, but clear criteria must be set for establishing this and these must be continuously updated."
"The organisations are autonomous, which means that they are free to decide with whom, in the given representative framework, they wish to sit at the table, negotiate, perhaps reach agreement. They also decide, within the given framework, what they want to regulate."
"Out of respect for the autonomy of the organisations the public authorities and political bodies must not directly interfere in the composition of the social partners."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs supports all the basic elements of the proposals drawn up by the Commission to increase the efficiency of structured European social dialogue, as presented in the Communication of 20 May 1998 on adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level."
"The amendments approved by the committee do not stand in the way of this."
"I have a few more points to make on this topic. The social dialogue is doubtless part of what we call the European social model."
"In order to really do justice to this claim, it is crucial - and this is a point I would like to emphasise again - that the Commission should identify with it completely."
"This means that there can be no arbitrary restriction of the traditional jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Commissioner, for example, or of certain of the other Commissioners!"
"Regardless of jurisdiction, the social dialogue must be conducted seriously at the relevant level for all social issues."
"In future not only the employment guidelines but also the economic policy guidelines of the EU are to be discussed in the Standing Committee on Employment."
"The results of the consultations are to be forwarded to the relevant Councils in time to be included in their consultations and decision-making."
"This may seem obvious but from past experience it should not be taken for granted."
"In the context of accession measures for the central and eastern European countries we must ensure that these countries have in place appropriate structures for the social dialogue by the time of accession."
"I can only recommend to Parliament that it make its approval of accession conditional upon this."
"Because legislation comes into effect in the EU by means of a Council decision resulting from the social dialogue process, the fact that the European Parliament is not involved creates the problem of a lack of democratic legitimation for such legislation."
"Not least because of the rules which will in future become effective in all Member States and the duty of the Commission to present all social legislative initiatives to the social partners so that they can decide whether they wish to negotiate on the issue, Parliament must now insist on being placed on an equal footing with the Council in this procedure."
"As the Commission has now stated that it is prepared to participate in interinstitutional negotiations, whether or not this actually happens will depend on the Council."
"If Parliament continues to be excluded completely from this legislative procedure, while the Council has the last word, this will be a cardinal error that cannot be compensated for by extending the codecision procedure elsewhere."
"Mr President, the European integration process, particularly after economic and monetary union, must bear the hallmark of greater commitment to sustainable growth and development and to social policy and employment; indeed, this is the thrust of the reports presented this morning and this afternoon."
"Europe's social partners have a crucial role to play in this process, a role which is expressly recognised in the Treaty."
"The Member States must take account of basic social rights in all their actions, and one of their aims is to promote social dialogue."
"The new chapter of the Treaty devoted to employment, which was inserted at Amsterdam, also refers explicitly to consultation of the social partners."
"What is more, under the Treaty the social partners may negotiate European-level framework agreements on relevant social policy issues falling within their competence."
"Thus, because of the steadily increasing significance of the social dialogue, I should like to touch on three matters which crop up in the Commission's communication and are also referred to in Mr Peter's report."
"Firstly, the problem of representation and the representativeness of the organisations concerned."
"This is a problem that is beginning to arise in the Member States too, so in my opinion there is all the more cause to raise it at European level."
"In this context, the study launched by the Commission - which we hope will soon be completed - will undoubtedly be most helpful in consolidating the European social dialogue, and will go a long way to avoiding the sort of disputes that have occurred in the past, some of which have even ended up in court."
"The second matter is sectoral dialogue."
"The development of social and sectoral dialogue can be crucial in terms of predicting and managing industrial change in the Community, paving the way for further progress and improving quantitative and qualitative results."
"My final point relates to the role of the European Parliament."
"Although I appreciate the Commission's willingness to keep Parliament informed, under the legislative procedure laid down in the Protocol, I believe that an interinstitutional agreement should be concluded in the near future with a view to involving Parliament - the only institution directly elected by the citizens - in the legislative procedure provided for in the Agreement on Social Policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the social dialogue procedure is still a relatively new arrival in the European Union."
"After two successful test runs involving the guidelines on parental leave and on part-time working, we now have a Commission communication that is considered to be a revision and a new direction."
"The Commission has not provided anything new."
"The rapporteur, Mr Peter, whom I should like to thank warmly for his collaboration, has put a great deal of effort into his report."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be overlooked that the trade unions had the lead role in this extremely important text."
"There need not be anything wrong with this if negotiations remain balanced and fair."
"It is difficult to understand why the Commission should give increased support to only one side: that of employees' representatives."
"The ETUC certainly does not require any coaching or particular support in its work."
"The financial support provided by the Commission for the ETUC should also be adequate."
"I would now like to address a key issue."
"The current round of social dialogue takes the form of tripartite negotiations, and many who cannot take part directly in the negotiations object to this."
"The Commission has not been able to come up with any satisfactory proposals."
"The Christian trade unions are still waiting in the wings, as are many representatives of small sectors and areas of employment."
"Even if 80 % of UNICE's members are from SMEs, UEAPME, as a direct and individual SME representative at EU level, has so far been forced to adopt a completely unacceptable position in the social dialogue."
"Our group has protested against this again and again, and has asked that UEAPME be included. UNICE and UEAPME are now concluding a contractual agreement that should allow SME representatives to participate directly in negotiations within the context of the social dialogue."
"I deliberately say 'should', as we will have to wait and see how it works and whether the UEAPME representatives consider themselves to have been accepted."
"This would solve one problem to a certain degree, even if it is only a stopgap, but other parties continue to be excluded from the negotiations."
"We now urgently need the study of representativeness that the Commission announced in 1996, and then we will have to take another long, hard look at the participants in the social dialogue."
"At that point, at the very latest, the position of the European Parliament as the only democratically legitimate body of the European Union will have to re-examined, since our role in the social dialogue is also unsatisfactory."
"We therefore continue to have two major problems facing us in the context of the social dialogue that are only too familiar to us."
"Our group is determined to continue to work towards a solution to both these problems."
"We owe it to the small organisations."
"Mr President, what we are mainly dealing with here is how to structure the social dialogue as it operates between the two sides of industry."
"The end result of such a process is a collective agreement of some kind - an instrument often better suited to resolving issues than legislation."
"We have used this model of negotiation in Scandinavia for a long time now and would be happy to see it adopted at European level."
"All the same, policy-makers should beware of seeing the passing of laws as an inevitable consequence of entering into a social dialogue and promoting collective agreements."
"Legislation may follow, but that should not be the main purpose of the exercise."
"The role of national authorities and the EU institutions is to further cooperation between autonomous and independent negotiating partners, as the rapporteur rightly says in paragraph 8."
"It will be up to the public bodies to act as mediators and facilitators, fostering contacts between the parties and stimulating discussion."
"Many openings exist; there is no need to reach for the legislative option every time."
"I have three further points, Mr President. If the necessary connection between the employment guidelines and the economic policy guidelines is to be made, the Standing Committee on Employment would be well advised to discuss them in parallel."
"Secondly, the social dialogue will need special consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe, since the parties have not had the same scope for cooperation as has existed in labour relations elsewhere."
"Lastly, let us not forget that the local and regional authorities are major employers too. We will have to find a better way of incorporating them - as a matter of course - into the process of dialogue and cooperation."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and also to pay tribute to Commissioner Flynn for his involvement in this whole area."
"With any model of social dialogue and social partnership, rights are devolved to the social partners to negotiate, consult and come up with framework agreements which should be implemented on a European basis."
"Alongside the rights there are obligations."
"A very important aspect, perhaps sometimes overlooked by this Parliament, is the obligation to come to the table with a real negotiating position and not just take a stance for the cameras."
"In particular, it is necessary to broaden the partnership to include those sectors that are at present excluded, in particular the SME sector."
"We should also look at questions like the disability sector, the education sector and the importance of life-long learning and education and training with regard to employment and other social exclusion problems which we discussed this morning, when we were speaking about the Van Velzen report and the Commission's response."
"Maybe we should now examine how we can bring more people into the social dialogue."
"One way that we could do this, perhaps on a trial basis, is with a third type of organisation which also incorporates the Economic and Social Committee."
"This would be more representative and could be used as a clearing house for some of the minor details and proposals."
"I am concerned about the role of Parliament in this whole process."
"Sometimes we in Parliament feel that we are presented with a fait accompli agreed by the social partners, and that this is political blackmail - we cannot oppose it because the social partners have agreed it."
"Therefore some role must be found for Parliament in the interactions between the social partners."
"However, bearing those points in mind, I would commend this report to the House and my group will be supporting the position of the rapporteur."
"Mr President, under Article 118b of the Single European Act, the Commission is required to 'develop relations between management and labour at European level'. Yet the local and regional authorities - who together constitute one of Europe's largest employers - are being sidelined from this process."
"Local and regional employers in the EU are extremely annoyed at not being seen as fully- fledged partners in the cross-sectoral social dialogue."
"CEMR, the body representing hundreds of thousands of municipalities and regions around Europe, was set up back in 1951. It is somewhat bizarre that an organisation representing the employers of over 14 million people full-time - and up to 30 million, if part-time workers are included - should be left out in this way."
"The members of CEMR are very active in labour relations nationally and often enjoy negotiating powers."
"They have behind them a long tradition of negotiating practice, after years of successful participation in social dialogue at national level."
"It therefore makes sense in my view to envisage taking CEMR on board as a full and equal partner."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for producing such a fine and eloquent text."
"In future, the social dialogue will play an ever-increasing part in shaping EU policy. One of the main reasons for this is that the new treaty includes a specific reference to social and employment issues."
"I wish to concentrate on three points."
"Mrs Schörling was talking about the important question of fair representation."
"Just how are we going to enhance representation?"
"Is it a matter for politicians, or should the parties directly concerned be left to work things out for themselves?"
"In line with Swedish tradition, my belief is that it is up to management and labour to ensure that they are properly represented."
"The workers' side - including public sector employees - has managed to get its act together."
"The employers will now have to see to it that they follow suit."
"Whilst I can appreciate the desire to reduce the membership of the Standing Committee on Employment, I do feel that something may be lost if that happens."
"We must not lose sight of the need for outreach from the Standing Committee to the Member States."
"A Brussels-only phenomenon is not what we want at all."
"I would therefore urge people to take heed of paragraph 13 in Mr Peter's report."
"Thirdly, I should like to raise the matter of the Standing Committee's remit."
"Employment policy cannot be seen in isolation, as separate from economic policy."
"It is essential for the Standing Committee on Employment to encompass macroeconomic issues and take part in drawing up economic policy guidelines."
"Lastly, I agree with what has already been said on Parliament's role in this process."
"Mr President, a few days ago the presidents of UNICE and UEAPME declared that, respecting each other's autonomy, they would be recognising one another as interlocutors in future European negotiations and would be stepping up their cooperation in that context."
"UNICE acknowledges meanwhile that UEAPME is the body most representative of the specific interests of SMEs in Europe, and is thus giving it a place at the negotiating table."
"If this agreement is finalised on 4 December by the decision-making bodies of the two organisations, a major step will have been taken towards achieving something which the PPE Group called for at the time of the Maastricht Treaty, namely full participation in European social dialogue by a partner speaking specifically for SMEs."
"We are in favour of social dialogue, Mr President, but as a democratically elected body we cannot but approve of growing autonomy for the social partners, provided these are sufficiently representative - that word again."
"This presupposes, amongst other things, that these partners together will cover enough of the ground to ensure that different interests are given sufficient consideration in negotiations."
"This agreement represents a particularly significant step in that direction."
"I would ask the Commission to honour the agreement in setting the long-awaited representativeness criteria."
"We could put it this way, Mr President."
"An engagement has been announced which will increase the representativeness and legitimacy of the social dialogue."
"Anyone who now puts a spoke in the wheel and stops the wedding from going ahead or stops the couple from living together will bear an enormously heavy burden of responsibility."
"SMEs are important creators of jobs."
"They must have the chance - by virtue of having their own social partner at the European negotiating table - to take part in the negotiations and in that way to give expression and shape to their desire to be a responsible player."
"Mr President, Ireland's version of the social dialogue, which we call social partnership, is well established and has played a major part in the economic success which our country has achieved over recent years."
"Our version of social partnership is in many ways ahead of the social dialogue."
"The traditional social partners - the unions and the employers - are certainly central to the process, but they have been joined by others: farmers, women, people with disabilities, the unemployed and other marginalised groups."
"I would like to see that broadened to include those representing the development area."
"The benefits of the change from an adversarial to a consensual approach are very clear to everybody."
"But there have been difficulties for many in Ireland, as the Ryanair dispute earlier this year clearly showed."
"While we have managed to reach consensus on issues such as pay and taxation, the question of employee consultation within firms has not yet been adequately explored."
"It is for this reason that I really welcome last week's decision by the Commission."
"Commissioner Flynn is to be congratulated for coming forward with a draft directive on worker consultation in firms with more than 50 employees."
"I see the Commissioner is rightly satisfied."
"This is another success and I hope to do the report."
"I am convinced that the Ryanair dispute in Ireland would have been solved long ago if this directive had been in place."
"Ireland fits somewhere between the continental European social model and the Anglo-Saxon model."
"Worker consultation and information is a key part of the former but relatively unknown in the latter."
"But it is strange that many companies in Ireland which do not negotiate with trade unions representing their own workers at local level do not seem to have great difficulty dealing with unions at the national or European levels."
"I therefore call on all employers to be consistent in their approach to social dialogue and to take a positive view of the new directive."
"Increased worker participation helps to achieve a happier, more highly motivated and more productive workforce."
"Is this not what employers want?"
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Peter on his report, which is of a very high quality."
"If agreements by the European social partners acquire legal force in the European Union in the area of work by making them generally binding through a Council decision, the SMEs will be among those most affected as they employ the majority of workers in Europe."
"The report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to call for increased involvement of the SMEs in shaping the European social dialogue, which is an issue of great concern to the Group of the European People's Party, as is clear from our Amendment No 9."
"The social dialogue is necessary at both European and national levels."
"It is also successful at company level."
"This is illustrated by the success story of the European Works Council and the positive development of the discussion on the European Company."
"Or so I am told, Commissioner. In both cases the remedy has been negotiations by the social partners to establish ways in which the workers can participate."
"A conference organised by the Austrian Presidency took place in Vienna last week on the European social model and the social dialogue."
"Comparisons were made with other models, for example with the market economy pure and simple, as in the emergent industrial nations of South-East Asia."
"But as they have neglected the social dimension many of the Asian tigers have in economic terms become tame, lame domestic cats."
"The effective answer to globalisation is the European model, the social market economy based on social partnership and social dialogue."
"The Group of the European People's Party will therefore be voting in favour of the Peter report."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Peter for his report, which has been very helpful."
"I would remind you that in 1996 the Commission initiated a major consultation exercise on the future of the social dialogue through the consultative communication."
"At that time Parliament drew up a comprehensive resolution on the document and I was here in Strasbourg to discuss it with you in the summer of 1997."
"The Commission has worked very hard to take on board your comments in drafting this second communication."
"The new Amsterdam Treaty provides the means for a renewed commitment of the social partners to modernise and strengthen the social dimension of Europe."
"To do this the social dialogue must be helped."
"It has to be helped to play its full role within the framework of supportive and efficient information, consultation and negotiation procedures."
"As you said in the 1997 resolution, there are some key issues that we had to tackle and there are three of them."
"Firstly, the need to reform the Standing Committee on Employment: considering the new focus on employment and the unwieldiness of the current structure, it has not worked well and has to be reformed."
"Secondly, the importance of creating a more coherent and efficient framework within which the sectoral dialogue could develop and, finally, the question of representativeness."
"The Commission's communication on adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level was adopted on 20 May this year."
"It addresses these three issues and sets out to strengthen the social dialogue at the European level and to make it more adaptable so that we can link the work of the social partners much more closely with the development and the implementation of all our European Union policies."
"I begin with the question of representativeness, because it was raised by a number of Members - Mrs Ghilardotti, Mrs Glase, Mrs Schörling and Mrs Thyssen - and I am grateful for their concern."
"It is clear that the institutions have to fully respect the autonomy of the social partners during their negotiations."
"It is the social partners which, in this context, are responsible for ensuring sufficient representativeness."
"However, as regards consultations, the institutions have to take their responsibilities to ensure the best possible representativeness."
"It must be remembered that the Court of First Instance recently supported this approach in a landmark judgment."
"We take the principle of the autonomy of the partners very seriously indeed."
"In view of the European Parliament's call on the Commission to reform the Standing Committee on Employment, as a matter of urgency, the Commission adopted a parallel to the communication: a proposal to the Council to reform the current structure."
"What we want to do there is to give each presidency the choice of either calling a troika of Heads of State or Government or a council to meet with the social partners within the framework of the Standing Committee on Employment."
"The social partner delegations to these meetings should be restricted in their number but always include the main social partner organisations."
"In short, the Commission suggests to the Council creating a single, transparent and representative forum for high-level dialogue on employment."
"So the ball is really in the Council's court, to ensure that the real dialogue on employment is not restricted just to a core group of social partners."
"With regard to the other consultation procedures, the communication introduced a liaison forum, involving quarterly consultations with all recognised European social partners on policy matters."
"The first of these forums has already taken place and has proved to be a very useful exercise indeed."
"Furthermore, at the sectoral level, new, flexible, sectoral committees will replace the many existing and cumbersome structures."
"This decision caused some initial fears of a reduction in support for the sectoral dialogue."
"Many of you have been in contact with me personally to query the practicalities of this new structure."
"I will emphasise again here that this is not a reduction but rather a new start for the sectoral dialogue, where all the sectors wanting to make a meaningful joint contribution at European level can take part on equal terms."
"There will no longer be a restriction of formalised support to activities where there is exclusive Community competence."
"So the need to discuss industrial restructuring in employment matters is present today in all sectors of activity."
"Just a few words about the Peter report."
"Mr Peter and the Social Affairs Committee have once again managed to strike a fair balance between the different interests that are involved."
"This is a very good report."
"I would simply like to reiterate the importance of respecting the autonomy of the social partners."
"I would therefore question whether it is politically or, indeed legally, feasible to involve any form of consultative committees in the negotiations between the partners or to involve any national organisations directly at European level."
"As for the key point of the communication, I find the report is very supportive indeed and this is true of reform of the Standing Committee on Employment, the new sectoral dialogue committees, the representativeness question and the importance of developing a social dialogue with the applicant countries."
"This should not come as a surprise because, as I have already stated, the position taken on these issues in the communication takes into account to a large extent the position of the European Parliament."
"So the whole exercise serves, in my opinion, as an example of very good cooperation and understanding between our institutions."
"Mr Crowley raised the question of the involvement of the European Parliament in the decision-making process leading to the adoption of legislation based on European agreements."
"I wish to say to him that the Commission worked for the involvement of Parliament in this very respect during the IGC."
"As emphasised in our draft report, this standpoint is clearly reiterated in our communication, and I know there are ongoing contacts between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in order to resolve this particular issue."
"You know where I stand and where my support is on that point."
"I wish to say to Mrs Thyssen that UNICE is in dialogue with UEAPME about the representativeness issue."
"We understand that great progress is being made, and certainly I support that."
"I would say to Mr Lindqvist, on the question of enlargement, that on all my visits to the applicant countries I have sought out the social partners to talk with them."
"There are real problems there."
"Through PHARE, we are trying to help the development of the dialogue there."
"We look at the state of the social dialogue in all the screening exercises on each of the applicants. But it is a very keen point and we will return to it certainly."
"Finally, I wish to say to Mrs Schörling that local government is part of CEEP, and I understand they are contemplating a sectoral dialogue."
"If that is the case, I would greatly support it."
"I thank Mr Peter."
"It has been a very useful debate, and I look forward to the continuation and the enhancement of the social dialogue."
"Mrs Malone, what happened last week on information and consultation was an enormous step forward."
"We look forward to debating that issue in the House at a later date."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"New Transatlantic Marketplace"
"The next item is the report (A4-0387/98) by Mrs Mann, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the Commission communication on the 'New Transatlantic Marketplace' (COM(98)0125 - C4-0271/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner Brittan, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a few fundamental points before I discuss the report."
"Today's debate will be dominated by the Americans' threat to impose sanctions in the form of duties on products from Member States of the European Union, in particular from France and the UK, in order to undermine the present regulation on the banana market before 1 January 1999 and to stir up trouble among the Member States."
"It is particularly ironic that the General Affairs Council made its decision on adopting the Action Plan for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership on 9 November 1998, at almost the same time as the Americans decided to impose unilateral sanctions on the European Union."
"This step by the Americans threatens the credibility of the whole WTO dispute settlement procedure."
"The Americans are within their rights not to agree with the new banana market regulation."
"They are within their rights to believe that this regulation is not consistent with WTO rules."
"But they are not within their rights to decide this themselves."
"However attractive such wild west behaviour may seem at national level, it provokes severe counter-reactions."
"Increasing nervousness on the part of the Americans is nevertheless understandable and can be explained largely by their current trade deficit, which is relatively large."
"So we should adopt a calmer stance in future."
"We are doing well to consolidate and expand the political and economic basis between us."
"The banana dispute will not be our last trade dispute; the next ones, on hormones and steel, are already on the horizon."
"We must accept these realities."
"Since 1989 and 1990 our relations have been undergoing a sea-change."
"The conditions which we formerly took for granted have changed and we have become global competitors."
"Economic and trade policy determine more than ever the political actions of the two world powers."
"However, we should not forget that we compete on a solid basis of friendship."
"Nor should we forget that adapting and strengthening economic relations guarantees jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."
"The huge merger of Daimler and Chrysler is only a foretaste of what we can expect in the near future."
"The present report on the Action Plan 'Transatlantic Economic Partnership' expressly supports the initiative of the Commission and the Council."
"You will all remember that during the last summit between the European Union and the United States in London, the Council, particularly France, withheld its approval and presented a new plan that was less ambitious."
"The result of the process was then the Transatlantic Economic Partnership rather than the Transatlantic Marketplace."
"The Council feared that the Commission's proposal to call for a framework agreement with a general negotiating mandate would result in an uncontrolled transfer of national decision-making powers and scope."
"A framework agreement would have had the advantage for the European Parliament of allowing it to be formally consulted."
"Now we are merely informed."
"The Action Plan for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership proposes firstly the coordination of multilateral activities and secondly the coordination of a bilateral agenda for the following areas: first, removal of technical barriers; second, intensification of the role of labour in services; third, increased market access for EU and US companies in government procurement; fourth, better protection for intellectual property; fifth, strengthened dialogue and the creation of social cooperation structures in the areas of food, plant and animal health and biotechnology, and the creation of an environmental group."
"I believe that this is a good report and we should support it."
"However, the creation of an organisational framework should also be part of this report. Many of the issues that are the subject of negotiations relate to what are regarded as new, sensitive areas, such as biotechnology."
"This organisational framework should also define the forms of institutional cooperation between the institutions and procedures involved, and in many cases open the door to agreements, along the lines of mutual recognition, on certification and testing procedures."
"To allow this to work in areas that are very sensitive for the consumer, it is essential that the process be absolutely transparent, and that the industries, experts, occupational groups and consumers concerned be kept fully informed and consulted."
"We must build up an institutional process of trust so that we can ensure the broad approval of the public."
"Certainly, I do not share the fear of some Members of the House and of the consumer associations that we are ignoring the general public."
"We have become institutional experts, in a manner of speaking, so it is not amateurs that are taking action at European level, either in the Commission, the Council or Parliament."
"We are perfectly capable of managing this process very well."
"Mr President, the relationship between the European Union and the United States is a very important one."
"We share many common values and interests and, while trade and investment links between us represent the world's largest economic partnership, it would be wrong to restrict discussions to simply trade and economic matters."
"I regret the fact that the more ambitious plans suggested by Sir Leon Brittan under the heading of the new transatlantic marketplace met with such strong opposition in the Council and were therefore not discussed with the US authorities."
"Consequently, the obstructive stance of the Council resulted in the more restricted proposals contained in the transatlantic economic partnership."
"When the European Parliament discussed the Souchet report in January of this year we expressed the desire for a more comprehensive level of cooperation."
"Paragraph 3 of the Souchet resolution pointed to the need for greater dialogue in relation to justice and home affairs."
"Paragraph 5 called for greater cooperation regarding the management of crisis situations and the use of peace-keeping forces."
"The opinion that I have produced on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee attempts to restore the wishes of Parliament and, I hope, of Sir Leon Brittan himself, to ensure that security and defence relations become an important part of the EU-US dialogue."
"An EU-US summit will be held shortly and it is important that we are able to examine the state of our respective relationships and resolve any problems, including those in the field of security and defence which are underlined by the current crisis in the Gulf."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her report and I thank her for including in it the specific proposal contained in the Foreign Affairs Committee opinion on this important issue."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. (NL) Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has given broad support to the transatlantic economic partnership and Mrs Mann's excellent report on it."
"Without in any way playing down the importance of multilateral talks, I think it is good that the two biggest players in the world market should be talking about eliminating barriers to free trade."
"Together, the two trading blocs can provide the combined impetus for launching the debate which is needed if a multilateral agreement is ultimately to be concluded."
"Of course, that must not mean that the EU and the USA together form a power bloc so that other countries are faced with a fait accompli within the WTO."
"But the ideal of regional trading blocs is consistent with the ideals of the WTO."
"Apart from long-standing issues which are obviously harder to resolve, there are two newer issues causing me some concern in the current trade relations between the EU and USA."
"Firstly there is the metric-only directive."
"In the meantime, Commissioner Bangemann has promised at the Internal Market Council that he will bring forward a proposal quickly, though he does not say how quickly, to defer the requirement that products should be labelled using the metric system only."
"That proposal ought really to have been made months ago."
"I have pressed the Commissioner for it on several occasions."
"Europe is all about helping business and industry to play a more powerful role, not about hampering it."
"The Economic Affairs Committee proposed in an amendment that conclusion of the transatlantic economic partnership should be conditional on the USA going over to the metric system."
"We gave careful thought to this."
"We were sorry that the REX Committee watered down our amendment to the point where it was neither fish nor fowl."
"I hope that Mr Bangemann gets the message."
"There has to be an end to the burden placed on European business and industry by American recalcitrance."
"I think that Mr Bangemann and Sir Leon Brittan must put pressure on the USA."
"My second concern is about anti-dumping measures in the EU and the USA."
"Mrs Mann devotes just one paragraph to this in her report, and the European steel industry complains that it receives unreasonably harsh treatment."
"Even the US Congress says in a major report that the ratio last year was 35 anti-dumping cases on the American side compared with just two on the European side."
"Mr President, these relations are also extremely important as far as jobs are concerned."
"On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would make the point that 59 % of EU investment goes to the USA, and the figure in the other direction is 44 %, so to both parties that is very important in terms of jobs."
"In an increasingly global world economy, however, there is more to it than trade relations alone."
"We also have a responsibility to work together to tackle important issues of the kind which can lead to a new declaration by the International Labour Organisation on fundamental labour standards such as freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, non-discrimination, the abolition of forced labour and of child labour."
"Both parties can play a part here in the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"But there are more things of relevance to the social and employment dimension."
"Let me quote a few of them."
"Take European works councils, for example: numerous companies in Europe with parent companies in the USA come under the directive on European works councils, and there needs to be a proper exchange of information here between US and European firms and governments."
"Another issue is that of pension funds."
"Europe is a long way behind when it comes to the provision of investment loans."
"Here too we need to work together, take notice of each other and talk to one another."
"Lastly, Mr President, agriculture is a not insignificant obstacle in transatlantic negotiations."
"In my view, things can get better here if not only the EU authorities but the US authorities too take greater account of social and employment issues in rural areas."
"Optimum competition does not always have the best outcome for all parties in the world."
"A balanced approach is needed here."
"As my very last point, I should like to say that our education and training programmes ought also to include provision for exchanges with America.."
"First of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her admirable report and also on the way in which she has put the banana contest in its proper perspective."
"I will come to that at a later stage, but I entirely agree with her that we must not allow it to completely distort our consideration of relations between the European Union and the United States, which relate to wider issues."
"Some of those have already been referred to by the previous speakers."
"I am grateful to Mr Cushnahan for his kind remarks about the scaling down of the new transatlantic marketplace proposals."
"They were more ambitious."
"I do not apologise for that."
"Nonetheless they have certainly informed the transatlantic economic partnership."
"But important as the transatlantic economic partnership is, Mrs Peijs is quite right to say that the multilateral aspect of that should not allow us to give the impression of ganging up against the rest of the world."
"We are cooperating to try and make faster progress in the multilateral talks, not seeking to impose a diktat, still less a fait accompli."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak is right in saying that the discussions that we have with the United States have to include matters relating to social and employment questions, just as Mr Cushnahan is right in saying that there is a very important security and defence component in our relationship, even though that has to be pursued outside the transatlantic economic partnership."
"Nonetheless, the transatlantic economic partnership is the most recent feature of the relationship, deriving from the new transatlantic marketplace and now, as Mrs Mann reminded us, endorsed by the Council last week in the form of an action plan."
"Negotiating directives have been approved for the Commission to start bilateral negotiations on a series of agreements relating to technical barriers to trade in goods, services, public procurement and intellectual property."
"It is a major initiative to consolidate and enhance transatlantic relations, including both multilateral and bilateral elements."
"Bilaterally the core element is the tackling of trade issues such as regulatory barriers, which are the main current obstacle to transatlantic business while preserving a high level of protection for health, safety, consumers and the environment."
"If we can achieve a degree of progress in dealing with these barriers, that promises great new economic opportunities for European firms and consumers."
"If we can stimulate further multilateral liberalisation then I believe we will be able to make great headway in the new millennium and save a great deal of time."
"The European Parliament has played a key role in this process, first with its call in January this year for a new impulse in transatlantic relations and afterwards through its involvement in the evolution of the transatlantic economic partnership."
"I am very glad that we have been able to work together."
"This will need to continue, not only in the face of the threat represented by the banana dispute but also in dealing with, for example, the unjust and inaccurate allegations that have recently been made about the European Union not doing its share in taking the strain of additional Asian exports."
"So I welcome the very operational report of Mrs Mann and thank her for the support that she and Parliament have given to the development of the relationship."
"I can give you some preliminary reactions to the report."
"We fully share your desire to see positive results in the areas of MRAs, food safety, government procurement, intellectual property, compliance with international rules in the liberalisation process and many other areas."
"I welcome the European Parliament's desire to enhance its involvement in the work to be done on the transatlantic economic partnership."
"Unfortunately all this has been overshadowed in recent days not only by the position of the United States on Asian exports but most of all by the recent controversy over bananas."
"The position is really quite simple."
"The WTO ruled against certain aspects of our regime and gave us until 1 January next year to comply with the ruling."
"We have taken action to comply fully with it and a revised regime which we believe to be entirely consistent with WTO rules will take effect on 1 January."
"The US is entitled to disagree with us about the compatibility of our new regime with the WTO rules."
"It has the right to challenge this if it wishes, but only according to the procedures established by the WTO which are readily available to deal with precisely this sort of disagreement."
"No WTO member has the right unilaterally to judge the compliance of another, nor to be judge and jury in its own cause."
"In resorting to unilateral action the United States is setting itself above the law and resorting to the principle of 'might is right'."
"This threatens to damage the system which we both helped to create."
"It will seriously undermine the confidence of WTO members in that system."
"Therefore, we have publicly called on the United States to desist from unilateral action and seek to resolve our differences according to the lawful multilateral channels which are readily available and are the sole means that a law-abiding country should choose."
"We are ready to cooperate with the United States to deal with our differences within the WTO rules and procedures but we will not do so under the threat of illegal unilateral action."
"Unless the United States desists from that we will have no alternative but to go to the WTO and begin proceedings against the United States for its unlawful action."
"I regret that this issue has overshadowed - at least in the headlines - the broader and more important work we have been doing."
"It is, indeed, as Mrs Mann has rightly said, ironic that this should be the case."
"I look to the European Parliament to be robust in the defence of European interests where they are under attack but also to take the broader view of what we need to do for the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that the issue of trade and economic relations between the European Union and the USA is one which usually inspires very heated debates and, I would say, intense passions."
"That happens because so far we have been unable to form relations of mutual trust and open, sincere communication, despite the prolonged talks and negotiations, despite the planning of an ambitious programme and despite the honest efforts both by the Commission and by our rapporteur, our esteemed colleague Mrs Erika Mann, whom I congratulate on her report."
"From what you have said, Commissioner, it is clear that we are still facing a very difficult interlocutor who is also burdened by activities which have shown that the United States, to promote its own exclusive interests, does not hesitate to violate international rules, and this to the cost of the poorest and weakest countries."
"The truth of what I am saying is demonstrated by the fact that problems are still outstanding related to extraterritorial American legislation, while competition against the Union is constantly becoming keener."
"So in view of the forthcoming transatlantic summit conference, the European Parliament must today send out some very clear messages, such as these:"
"First, the bipartite approach is acceptable to the extent that it does not impede multipartite negotiations at WTO level and does not create obstacles to access by third countries to markets in the Union and the USA."
"Second, respect must be ensured for the rules of international law, and a definitive solution must be found for the dispute concerning extraterritorial laws."
"Third, any commitments undertaken must be compatible with the acquis communautaire , especially with the CAP and the trade agreements we have concluded, particularly those with our traditional partners."
"They must also be compatible with the commitments undertaken by the Union under the Lomé Convention and in the context of the enlargement procedure with central and eastern European countries."
"Fourth, cooperation must include and emphasise social issues, such as securing the rights of working people and safeguarding collective bargaining, the abolition of child labour and forced labour, job creation, and the mutual recognition of qualifications."
"Fifth, any agreement must be compatible with the high standards that prevail in Europe concerning health and safety, consumer protection, and the protection of the natural and human environment."
"Sixth, cooperation must lead to the establishment of rules on the operation of credit institutions in all countries and control of the international movement of capital. I say this bearing in mind the present economic and money-market crisis."
"Finally, the European Parliament must be kept constantly informed about the negotiations, most particularly about matters that relate to co-decision procedures."
"As our rapporteur Mrs Mann said, there must be transparency and full information."
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party welcomes Mrs Mann's report and congratulates her on her very useful arguments presented here over 43 pages, though they have been overshadowed by current events."
"The USA's relations with the European Union are a high priority for all of us, and in future, despite all the conflicts caused in our bilateral relations both by ourselves and particularly by the USA, we will continue to place great importance on the fact that we are dependent upon one another."
"Bananas, hormones, steel, the US trade deficit, all these things make us nervous."
"What increasingly concerns me about our relations with the USA is the fact that it is always the parliamentarians who put their governments under pressure and that administrations are often too cowardly to observe WTO rules because they always have to give in to domestic policy."
"It is precisely this that should make us, as Members of the European Parliament, intensify our own contacts with Congress, and not rely on the Commission, which always seems to be told: we cannot do anything, it is the members of Congress who do that."
"The Helms-Burton and d'Amato Acts, which violate the principles of international law, were also the work of members of Congress."
"Thankfully d'Amato cannot be voted in again, so that leaves one less to be considered."
"I say this because it must be clear that, as Sir Leon said, it must be the WTO requirements that determine our rules."
"The WTO sets the standard for free competition, and in free competition we compete with each other."
"Competition will become increasingly fierce, borders will become increasingly fluid, technology and in particular investment will become an area over which we Members of Parliament no longer have an overall view."
"We do not always see the source of the conflicts in question."
"This is all the more reason for us to support the Commission so that it does not debate for too long or look for compromises, but can often take a tough stance."
"The USA often accuses us of being only paper tigers or lightweights because when it is being tough our reaction is not tough enough."
"We must move more quickly in future with the new measures."
"As Parliament we can perhaps take a tougher stance than the Commission does."
"We are also accused of not really being affected by the growth of the Asian markets while the USA suffers as it has to take in all the cheap products."
"We face the same the problems, although it has to be said that one or two aspects of our trade policy are also rather doubtful, and this has nothing to do with the USA."
"We must monitor this and not simply say for the sake of national interests that one form of protectionism is good and the other bad."
"None of the 15 Member States would bear scrutiny here!"
"In conclusion, I believe that an appreciation of mutual-interest politics is always advantageous if we advocate the interests that are important for our European economy strongly and consistently."
"I would encourage us to intervene again in the current discussion about the USA's violation of the principles of international law."
"This report has given us a good opportunity to do so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly compliment Mrs Mann on her excellent report."
"The transatlantic economic partnership which has now been agreed can put an end to the succession of trade disputes we have seen in recent years."
"Remember the biotechnology bananas and all the rest of it."
"The agreement may serve as an example to the rest of the world."
"The European Union and the United States are the two biggest trading blocs in the world and each others' main trading partners as well."
"Bilateral agreement between two leading trading blocs will enable the Union and the USA to develop a transferable trading model consistent with the multilateral framework of trade, and in particular with the rules of the WTO."
"My group deplores the fact that the Council has given a negotiating mandate to the Commission and already adopted an action plan without waiting to hear the European Parliament's position."
"I agree with Mrs Mann and Mr Kittelmann."
"A new transatlantic economic partnership has major implications for private citizens and businesses in terms of jobs and prosperity."
"Democratic scrutiny is absolutely vital here, because only that will guarantee the requisite public acceptance."
"So my group also welcomes Mrs Mann's suggestion that a joint parliamentary committee should be set up, because we have seen time after time that solutions to disputes reached at civil servant or government level are regularly torpedoed again by the US Congress."
"Structural dialogue between parliamentary delegations and Members of Parliament may perhaps put an end to this."
"I would thus urge the Commission and the Council once again to stop talking to the Americans on their own and to involve Parliament to a far greater extent; they must not keep adopting plans without first waiting to hear what Parliament thinks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ever since the initiative of the transatlantic agenda, our relations with America have been visible."
"But I see that they are not sufficiently tangible, and this action plan may improve things here."
"Regrettably the action plan has come into being without the European Parliament being consulted in any way, and so I too support Mrs Mann's suggestion for a joint parliamentary committee linking the US Congress and our Parliament as the final democratic counterbalance in the new relationship."
"I must compliment Mrs Mann anyway on the form and content of her report."
"The new partnership may prevent bilateral trade disputes from ending in threats of sanctions, as happened over the EU's policy on bananas."
"But there are one or two things which are not covered."
"To my mind, too little attention is paid to the audiovisual imbalance."
"The USA does well out of the European market in this respect, but makes no concessions at all itself."
"We as the EU, with so many wonderful cultures, just cannot swallow that."
"Certainly not!"
"Furthermore, I hope that future political and economic dialogue will address the question of anti-dumping measures."
"Mrs Peijs has talked about that."
"My group is very anxious too to preserve the acquis communautaire and especially the services of general interest which have a considerable influence on our social and economic cohesion."
"These aspects must not be neglected."
"Lastly, Mr President, the partnership will be good for jobs."
"As Mrs Mann says, we shall have Daimler Benz and Chrysler on both sides of the Atlantic."
"I hope, though, that this initiative will stimulate not just commerce pure and simple, but above all the values and cultures which exist in the relationship between the USA and Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a transatlantic relationship that is of mutual benefit and positive for everyone else in the world is a fundamental political issue."
"Three conditions must be met: we must work to make trade more compatible with sustainable development and social welfare; we must respect multilateral solidarity and commitments; and we must guarantee real democratic control."
"By rejecting the MAI and transatlantic free trade projects, several European countries have highlighted the importance of these requirements and signalled their disapproval of a certain way of conducting external relations."
"We need a more autonomous and unified European Union and we would ask our American partners to show more loyalty towards the commitments they have made."
"The United States is renewing commercial tensions and is not respecting the London commitment on extraterritorial laws."
"We must remind them that the enormous deficit in the United States' balance of payments is inseparable from the privilege they have of financing their growth through other countries."
"The European Parliament is therefore faced with a contradiction: the renewal of aggressive commercial behaviour on the part of the Americans, and concern, on our part, for the development of dialogue."
"It is under these conditions that we will undoubtedly be forced to take other political initiatives."
"For the time being, we are taking note of the Transatlantic Economic Partnership and the Action Plan."
"We welcome the fact that it is not simply a resumption of the NTM project, which project was particularly dangerous because of its aim of guaranteeing free trade in services and because it favoured bilateral settlements, at the risk of stifling multilateral progress."
"We are also pleased that some of the provisions included in the Draft Action Plan have been removed by the Council, particularly a bilateral standstill agreement that would have suspended the development of Community rules."
"We are pleased, too, that the Council is resuming its supervisory role by placing bilateral negotiations under its mandate."
"We would finally like to stress the need to develop a new political doctrine for the Union in terms of both the content of the negotiations and democratic control."
"We want to discuss the future WTO negotiations with the Americans, but has the impact of the Uruguay Round been felt?"
"Do we know what we want to say on the new issues of society and regulation?"
"Within the partnership, we must not prepare the basis of an agreement between two giants - the United States and Europe - before the next millennium."
"Dialogue must only be exploratory and we have other friends to talk to."
"As regards bilateral negotiations, we would like to look at them on a case-by-case basis."
"We must defend employment and our industries, and this would mean strengthening their solidarity before the negotiations start."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise the fact that our institutional procedures are showing a political and democratic deficit."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to inform and consult the European Parliament both before and during the dialogue and negotiation process."
"Consultation of the civil society, which today is inexistent, must be organised, and it is up to the European Parliament itself to play a key role here in guiding firms, unions, associations and public opinion."
"Mr President, in order to prevent any misunderstandings right from the beginning, I must say that a good relationship with the USA is very important to us."
"But not in the way you see it, Sir Leon."
"Your first priority is the removal of so-called barriers to trade, and this includes political decision-making powers."
"Your plans for the NTM were rejected by the Council in the spring, and now a slimmed-down version of the TEP is on the table, practically a disguised MAI."
"But why should we applaud something that was rigged in advance?"
"The negotiating mandate for the TEP was given long ago."
"Yet we in the committee were only able to see it when the vote had already taken place."
"That is absurd."
"But some of its content is even more absurd."
"It does not contain anything about setting up joint programmes for sustainable development in the world economy, nor does it say anything about commitment to a better quality of life, about using fewer natural resources, or about strengthening the multilateral system."
"On the contrary, Charline Barschifsky stated on 28 July what the important issues are for the USA: the rights of US industry, the enforcement of US patent laws, crushing European protection laws in the field of biotechnology, the business interests of American banana producers, Helms-Burton, hormonized meat and genetically-modified food on European tables."
"You, Sir Leon Brittan, wish to sacrifice all European and national standards on the altar of free trade, in accordance with your neoliberal philosophy."
"Instead of constantly hatching new projects you should do your homework."
"You gave in on the issue of Helms-Burton instead of enforcing WTO rules."
"As a result, the Americans have taken legal proceedings against European firms in 5 911 cases."
"Now the US does not care about the WTO and is threatening a full-scale attack on European products if the EU does not given in to US interests in the banana dispute."
"We have been waiting for a reply from you since September on ECHELON, the unspeakable EU/US secret service dossier."
"The Greens certainly do not want to see more and more national and European consumer protection laws, for which we have fought so hard, being violated by dubious trade agreements in the name of free trade."
"We can only approve the report if our amendments are adopted."
"Mr President, I would naturally like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her report, which I believe to be balanced on the whole."
"This new partnership is obviously preferable to any notion of a single market between the European Union and the US, which was rightly rejected by the Council last April."
"The Action Plan proposed today by the Commission to establish this dialogue provides a framework for the negotiations in the months ahead."
"In my opinion, it is, for example, essential to establish a common strategy between the European Union and the United States with a view to laying down minimum social standards within both the WTO and the ILO."
"It may be beneficial to have discussions on services or electronic commerce provided that this does not undermine countries' cultural interests, and I am naturally thinking here of the audiovisual sector."
"The creation of a global economic area in the field of electronic commerce is, to my mind, completely premature, particularly when we know that the US is the market leader in terms of the Internet."
"This framework must therefore clearly establish the boundaries of the debate in terms of social, environmental and cultural issues."
"It is true that similar action plans exist and serve as a basis for discussion between the Union and other countries, such as Canada, New Zealand and Japan."
"But there is a fundamental difference between those countries and the United States: with them we do not negotiate with a gun at our heads."
"In fact, the US is once again threatening to impose 100 % customs duties on us, jeopardising the very existence of some of our companies."
"And surprise, surprise, the products concerned come from countries in the Union that produce bananas."
"So after the famous Helms-Burton legislation, the United States is again beginning to use gunboat diplomacy, and we cannot accept that."
"We do not underestimate the role of the American multinationals behind the Clinton administration."
"I am thinking here of Chiquita in the case of bananas, but also of the American oil companies that are encouraging the bombing of Iraq."
"That is why I believe that this notion of partnership must be suspended, and I call on the Commission to draw up a list of retaliatory measures aimed at certain American companies."
"We must stop being naive!"
"If the Americans want to complain, then let them, but let them do it before the WTO. And let us hope this time that the body responsible for settling disputes gives a clear ruling on the banana issue."
"In the meantime, my group believes that the report by Mrs Mann, good as it may be, should be referred back to committee."
"Mr President, recent developments that have taken place have tended to temper somewhat the optimism surrounding the report by Mrs Mann on the future of transatlantic economic relations."
"The rapporteur herself has just admitted this."
"In this respect, the entirely unacceptable threats of trade retaliation illegally made by Congress towards a number of our countries, outside the WTO dispute settlement procedure on the banana issue, show that our partners have an uncontrollable propensity for unilateralism. And this is true even though everyone knows that the economic survival of entire regions of the European Union, particularly in the French overseas territories, depends on a solution to the banana conflict."
"Moreover, on 21 October, Congress introduced a new provision that clearly has an extraterritorial effect, by adopting a corresponding amendment to Article 211 of the Finance Act, aimed at banning all transactions involving a well-known confiscated brand."
"This provision, which aims to block the commercial development of the Pernod-Ricard company on the American market, is further proof that the United States, far from renouncing unilateralism, is, on the contrary, forging ahead with sanctions that have an extraterritorial effect."
"This violation, which is taking place scarcely six months after the signing of the London agreement, makes us seriously question the credibility of the commitments that have been negotiated by the Commission with our American partners."
"This is all the more worrying since, in addition, Congress does not seem willing to vote for the derogations provided for by the London agreement, which itself still does not completely settle the question of American laws with extraterritorial effect."
"If we add to this use of unilateral instruments (which cannot fail to affect the implementation of the TEP), the lack of progress in the negotiations on government procurement and intellectual property (areas that are essential for Europe), the divergent positions on the future multilateral trade negotiations, and the stonewalling attitude that was maintained by the United States at the Buenos Aires Conference, it appears that the current situation is very worrying and requires a great deal of determination on our part."
"This determination can be easily seen in the Council, which has ensured, in particular, that the audiovisual sector is excluded and the status quo for services clearly rejected within the framework of the TEP."
"We hope that the Commission will also display such determination."
"Perhaps the Council has some concerns in this respect, since it thought it necessary to formally state that the Commission could not give a definite decision on the Union's position in the future multilateral trade negotiations, particularly in the audiovisual sector, without the Council's approval."
"It is unfortunate that in the recitals the rapporteur limits herself to deploring the institutional imbalance and does not mention these different and important concerns that may weigh heavily on the development of trade relations with the United States and on the implementation of the Transatlantic Economic Partnership if they are not tackled with enough determination by Europe."
"Mr President, the debate about the United States and Europe is an old one."
"Today, Commissioner, we are returning to it in a context that has three aspects: the United States' trade deficit, which we have all discussed; the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, which are multilateral and that is why we cannot understand this bilateral move, unless we recall the unpleasant memories of Blair House and your colleague, Franz Andriessen, at the beginning of the 1990s; and finally, of course, the American tradition of the big stick policy, with its attacks on Iraq, imperialism in the audiovisual sector, and selfishness in Rio."
"This all means that we may well have doubts about the sincerity of the United States."
"Everyone has mentioned - including Mr Sainjon and other speakers - the banana issue, the unilateral 100 % customs duties, the Helms-Burton legislation, Libya, Iran, Pernod-Ricard, etc."
"This leads me to put two questions to you, Commissioner."
"Firstly, I would like you to tell me about the strategy, the principle and the philosophy involved."
"Are the world trade negotiations necessary for the wealth of nations?"
"We signed the GATT in 1994."
"Has that led to increased wealth in Japan, Brazil, Korea or Thailand?"
"Has unemployment fallen?"
"Conversely, we rejected the MAI, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment."
"Who suffered because of that?"
"No-one did."
"The truth is that world trade, despite the myth, only plays a residual role."
"Let us look at the beef and veal market, for example."
"It does not even represent 10 % of our production."
"And if we had another policy besides Article 104c of the Maastricht Treaty, another policy besides austerity and rationing, we would have an internal demand that would do away with all this rubbish about having to find external markets."
"Secondly, I would like to know how we can have an independent trade policy when we do not have an independent foreign policy, when we do not have an independent military policy and when we behave as we have done in Iraq, the country of the Code of Hammurabi, the country of Babylonia?"
"I was with Mr Tariq Aziz three weeks ago and he asked the following question: 'I am offering Europe the best oilfields in southern Iraq."
"Why will Europe not accept them?' Mr Sainjon gave you the answer: when we have a global market, we should not hold bilateral negotiations."
"We are a parliament: we are not traders, we are not a chamber of commerce, we are representatives of the people."
"Mr President, I take the floor to make clear my support for Mrs Mann's report."
"As debate is focusing mainly on the background to this report rather than on its content, I should like to say that it might initially appear that, in principle, we are offering an olive branch whilst our friends in the United States are digging up the battle axe."
"I do not in fact believe that this is the case, because we could have applied many of the arguments we now use in connection with United States imperialism to each other in Europe in the past."
"Nevertheless, I do believe we must send two clear messages to our friends and allies in the United States: firstly, that the association known as the Transatlantic Economic Partnership essentially implies a shared responsibility on the world stage, at global level, and therefore at multilateral not just at bilateral level; and secondly, that we are not concerned solely with trade at this moment."
"We are indeed concerned with trade, but also, and especially at the moment, we wish to emphasise the notion of shared responsibility for the world as a whole. In particular, we are concerned with the financial situation, bearing in mind that our discussion is taking place on the eve of the introduction of the euro."
"I feel this is the first message we should send, and I for one have never been in favour of adopting a defensive position as a matter of course."
"I am convinced that we Europeans put forward very good reasons and arguments when we state that a market and a relationship have to be civilised and bilateral, and that they cannot be controlled solely by one party, in the kind of atmosphere portrayed - if I may be permitted a reference to the cinema - in 'High Noon', where the Sheriff wields absolute power."
"I believe that we are and must continue to be partners on equal terms."
"My second concern is that we must make it quite clear to our friends in the United States that we do not share the unilateral vision of managed trade they uphold and that is particularly evident not only in Act 301 and 'Super 301', but also in extraterritorial legislation such as the Helms-Burton Act and the D'Amato Act. In addition, it underlies several other measures that contravene the regulations of the World Trade Organisation."
"In my opinion, this report reflects our philosophy."
"However, we obviously need to do more."
"In the first instance, we need, for example, to coordinate the Commission, the Council and Parliament, given that they are not presently coordinated."
"In addition to being absent, the Council takes decisions without consulting Parliament."
"I think we need to prove that we can act as one, like the United States."
"If we do, I am sure we will be listened to."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank Mrs Mann for her report, which we support. I should also like to express my appreciation to the Commissioner for his efforts towards developing the best possible transatlantic relations."
"Unfortunately, what seemed at first to be a good idea - the Transatlantic Agenda - turned into something of a damp squib after April, when the Council took a number of decisions we perhaps did not all support."
"I agree entirely with Mr Enrique Barón who has just said that we ought to get on well, as well as we can."
"Commissioner, you said that might is not necessarily right."
"It remains to be seen who will have most might, once the euro is in place, the European Union's institutions have developed and the 11 countries - soon to be more - are working together."
"In any case, power must be vested in the bodies, and we need to learn to use them to resolve conflicts."
"As the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has stated, the existing obstacles must be removed, and here, we are certainly not in a very happy position."
"The situation concerning Asian exports and the banana dispute are not exactly encouraging examples. Nevertheless, we have to ensure that, within the framework of the WTO, we can reach multilateral agreements that are compatible with the acquis communautaire , the CAP, the Lomé Convention, and the association and enlargement agreements."
"Commissioner, Parliament will support you, in the hope that we can establish a relationship on equal terms with our friends in the United States, insofar as the provisions of the law allow. It is quite clear, though, that Parliament will have to be more involved."
"As Parliament can express its support for your claims, you will be in a stronger negotiating position and so will we."
"It is not acceptable that our companies should still be experiencing difficulties in the area of government procurement in the United States, and there is a long list of other problems I do not think it appropriate to elaborate on here and now."
"We support the report, trust that deadlines for achieving the objectives are set and that we will find the way of enjoying the best possible relationship with our friends in the United States."
"Mr President, I want to concentrate on one area only."
"I have read few reports - even from the Commission - that have been stuffed so full of three and four-letter acronyms."
"The one that is missing is GMOs."
"If there is one area where US and European public opinion contrasts most it is here."
"In the European Union consumers are particularly resistant to genetically modified food and the governments of Luxembourg and Austria are moving against current European policy."
"On the other hand, in America crops which have been genetically modified are increasing and the proportion of maize now grown under GM conditions is quite large."
"Then there is this brave attempt to remove trade barriers between these two major trading blocs."
"My question to the Commissioner is: In such a market place as he proposes, how do we protect European citizens' preferences in public health and environmental areas, as illustrated by the GMO issue?"
"Mr President, the relations that link the United States and the European Union are very special."
"We form the most important trade relationship in the world."
"Therefore, the project for a new Transatlantic Economic Partnership carries great hopes for our respective economies and reasserts the objectives of Euro-American multilateral cooperation."
"The global economy requires us to participate in this regular dialogue, but recent events lead me to fear that this enhanced partnership, which we have achieved after months of work and negotiations, might be at risk if one of the partners does not apply the principles on which it is founded."
"The threats made by the United States of unilateral sanctions against European products, such as bananas and meat, are of some concern for the future, to say the least."
"A solution will have to be found to this dispute within the framework of the WTO, that is, through the multilateral legal channel."
"In any case, the application of unilateral sanctions against European products on the part of the United States would be unacceptable and would seriously damage the trust and cooperation that characterise our relationship."
"I agree with the rapporteur and I would like to pay tribute here to her excellent work and to insist that as far as possible Parliament be involved in and informed of the development of transatlantic relations."
"In addition, I fully agree with the proposal to create a US-Europe interparliamentary group."
"Mr President, the French left-wing government overturned the MAI agreement in the OECD, which it considered a threat to national sovereignty in social issues and matters relating to working life and the environment."
"My thanks to France."
"In a new combination of letters of the alphabet, TEP, the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, poses the same problems as the MAI."
"The TEP is a slimmed-down version of the MAI, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler said, and he is right."
"We are hanging flesh on the same skeleton."
"Free trade, which is the freedom of markets rather than people, is often an attack on the structures set up in a nation to protect its people and its environment."
"They were created with good intentions."
"Market forces have no social or ecological responsibility."
"For example, the views of consumers in Europe on the one hand, and the USA on the other, on health foods are fundamentally different."
"We do not want to eat hormone-treated meat."
"We do not want to eat poison-resistant, genetically-modified soya, maize or potatoes, nor any other new American foods."
"One problem in particular is the agreement on the reciprocal approval of products: approved one place, approved everywhere."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few comments. I would firstly like to say that I am surprised that the United States is using retaliatory measures towards the European Union."
"In the case of bananas, it is quite obvious."
"I am amazed that we are surprised because, in fact, it is not the first time."
"The United States has been playing this type of game for a very long time and, without getting involved here in kneejerk anti-American reactions, we should nevertheless remember the serious case of the Helms-Burton Act in which the European Union adopted an extremely timid attitude."
"We even withdrew our complaint to the World Trade Organisation - in accordance with who knows what regulation and what principle - but this demonstrated two things: intransigence on the one hand, and weakness on the other."
"It therefore seems to me to be time to put an end to this imbalance, particularly since - and I would like to mention this point - the United States has just showed itself up once again through its intransigence in Buenos Aires where it totally ruined a conference that was absolutely essential for the future of the planet."
"My second comment relates to the involvement of the European Parliament in the process we are discussing today."
"Are we going to continue to allow ourselves to be treated like this over the months ahead?"
"As far as I am concerned, I do not think we should run after a moving target."
"We firstly had the MAI, and I believe that we managed, along with others, to avert the danger."
"There is the New Transatlantic Marketplace, which has been rejected by the Council, and we are now being offered the Transatlantic Economic Partnership."
"When I look at what that project contains, I do not have the same positive outlook as some of my colleagues."
"I think that it basically involves stepping up and extending bilateral cooperation with the United States, even if we add to it the multilateral dimension."
"And it involves making general use of the principle of mutual recognition, particularly in areas such as biotechnology, food quality, the environment and social protection, which seems to me to be extremely dangerous."
"If Parliament accepts the idea of not intervening from the outset in this type of debate, I think that it is making a fool of itself and bringing discredit upon itself in the face of public opinion."
"Mr President, improved trade relations with the USA are a welcome development."
"Given the increasing trend towards globalisation, it is useful to have a good relationship with trading partners whose interests are similar to ours."
"The position of the individual Member States is fairly weak within a multilateral trading system, certainly since the advent of the World Trade Organisation."
"So this is a job for the European Union, especially when it comes to looking for like-minded trading partners."
"But I have a few cautionary comments to make on the new transatlantic marketplace."
"Earlier this year, Parliament approved a resolution on the environmental, health and consumer protection aspects of world trade."
"Those aspects are extremely important for the transatlantic marketplace."
"The Commission's communication does not take sufficient account of them."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Mann, when she insists that there can be no tampering with European legislation in this area."
"Another word of caution on the new transatlantic partnership concerns the place of the European Union in multilateral bodies and agreements."
"The Union's position in these must remain independent of the USA, especially in debate with and about the developing world."
"I am not talking here of the so-called 'banana preferences' referred to in Amendment No 4."
"I am concerned to ensure that this new transatlantic marketplace should not hamper the European Union in its worldwide pursuit of sustainable development and a fair distribution of prosperity."
"Nor must the new transatlantic marketplace lead to a widening of the gap between north and south."
"The same goes for other initiatives for cooperation by developed nations, for example the multilateral agreement on investment."
"Lastly, I would like consideration to be given to the cultural issues on the transatlantic agenda."
"There are important differences in approach here between the European Union and the USA."
"The Member States of the European Union, for example, have a different system for protecting intellectual property."
"On the question of whether or not a royalty should be paid for books made available on the Internet, we cannot allow the Americans to dictate to us."
"Europe's cultural identity must not be left to the mercy of the free market."
"Mr President, the report by our colleague remains very quiet about the serious imbalance that characterises the economic and trade relations between the European Union and the United States."
"However, the draftsmen of the opinions - whose opinions are annexed to the report - all mentioned this imbalance, in other words, the United States' unilateral domination of Europe."
"This domination is not a fabrication."
"It was the subject of a theory a good few years ago by Professor François Perroux of the Collège de France in Paris."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is, in fact, totally silent on this point, yet it is perhaps in the area of defence and arms that Europe is subject, in the most serious way possible, to American leadership, even going so far as accepting the gunboat diplomacy the United States currently applies towards European countries like Yugoslavia."
"For its part, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy pointed out, very appropriately, that the discussions with the United States on the transatlantic marketplace should have respected the acquis communautaire , particularly in the agriculture sector, the association agreements and the Lomé Convention, which is far from being the case."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights pointed out that the problem raised by the unilateral Helms-Burton and d'Amato-Kennedy Acts was still not settled."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs fears the loss of agricultural jobs in Europe with these transatlantic negotiations."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, in paragraph 4 of its opinion, fears discrimination against European industry."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media states in paragraph 7 that European television programmes only account for 2 % of the American market while American productions totally dominate this sector in Europe."
"This really is unilateral trade where Europeans are playing the role of the 'submissive colony'."
"Finally, the American federal states do not always feel bound by the agreements signed in Washington."
"We have seen several examples of this, particularly in the case of the market for electrical engineering a few years ago."
"With these few comments, we can see clearly that Europe is scarcely more than a satellite of the United States, and the real objective of this report should have been to discuss that issue."
"The transatlantic negotiations should aim to restore equality."
"But there is no question of that."
"The project for a transatlantic marketplace, as it stands, will give a little more encouragement to the colonisation of Europe by the American economic powers."
"We must reject this."
"Mr President, this is an excellent report but I have to say that I do regret its juxtaposition to the deep concern many of us have expressed here today about the threat to our banana regime."
"Commissioner Brittan, I heard you say last Friday on the BBC that the ongoing dispute with the United States is actually not about bananas but about trade rules and the obligation to comply with them."
"I have to say - and I know you are aware of this - that the poor farmers in the Caribbean are not going to be impressed by what they might see as a rather technocratic approach."
"They are bewildered and frightened by what they see as a relentless onslaught on the banana regime by the United States."
"If they are to grow another crop, as has been suggested, then - as you have said yourself - they are likely to resort to growing drugs."
"Therefore the principles here are very important indeed."
"As you rightly said earlier, sabre-rattling by the United States and the threat of sanctions against the European Union is something that we deeply regret, especially since there is no threat whatsoever to the United States' own economy."
"There are a number of questions that we need to ask."
"Is this dispute likely to be about rules; is it about hormones in beef; is it about the Democrats' pay-off to Chiquita bananas?"
"The Caribbean bananas which enter the European market account for only 7 % of the EU's market in bananas and also, if this wrangle is about Article 13 of WTO, there are other North-South arrangements that do not sit that happily with Article 13."
"I hope the United States recognises that as well."
"This is, I hope, the very last act in this banana drama that has been going on for many years."
"It needs to be shown up for what it is."
"I hope that the European Union will stand firm and say that there is a moral issue here, an issue of obligation and responsibility to our traditional suppliers in the Caribbean in particular."
"I hope that you will continue to make the case for real justice for the people of the Caribbean in the face of what is perceived by all of us here as the completely unacceptable attitude of the United States towards the European Union."
"Mr President, I have no intention of repeating the general statements made by previous speakers on the quality of the report. It covers all the key issues and I therefore congratulate Mrs Mann."
"Nevertheless, we regret the lack of mechanisms to prevent the United States from taking unilateral action in contravention of World Trade Organisation arrangements and to the detriment of bilateral relations."
"I do not want to talk about bananas."
"What had to be said has already been said by the other Members."
"No mechanisms are included to provide for concerted action in connection with third countries, such as China or Japan."
"Issues as important as the protection of databases, the protection of patents and intellectual property were omitted from the negotiations."
"I regret too that the liberalisation of international telecommunications, product responsibility, the harmonisation of customs issues and the standardisation and simplification of information required for business were not dealt with either."
"Mr President, we are convinced that transatlantic relations can be seen as an opportunity for Europe, especially in respect of difficulties still outstanding."
"Some of these problems are sizeable - we need only think of the barriers to trade and investment. Above all else, rules and regulations are what constitute the greatest difficulty and have given rise to a number of bilateral conflicts over the years."
"All things considered, the new transatlantic marketplace could serve to safeguard consumer interests, given the stated aim of eliminating by 2010 all existing tariffs on industrial goods, thanks to new agreements negotiated on the basis of mutual recognition, the so-called MRAs. These, in our opinion, should reproduce the levels of consumer protection, safeguards and environmental safety currently guaranteed by EU rules within the Community."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say that I will always be the first to defend close links with the United States: we are talking about the world's two main blocs and they both have special responsibilities."
"We believe that, apart from the bilateral links uniting us, we should endeavour to strengthen multilateral arrangements, provided that we bear in mind the interests of smaller countries as well as the United States and Europe."
"Of course, we must refer to the backward step taken over the banana issue."
"A mountain has been made out of a molehill."
"As far as bananas are concerned, what is at stake are bananas from Madeira - as a Portuguese Member I have to speak about them - but also from the Canary Islands and certain ACP countries."
"What is at stake are potential social problems for people with no alternative way of earning a living."
"Unless we lend a little support to banana production, I do not see what alternatives we might offer."
"I would like to add that this is not a typical issue and I hope that no others crop up. This is also feared, as it happens, by the rapporteur, Mrs Erika Mann, whom I congratulate."
"I hope that this problem has been sorted out and that cooperation can be strengthened between the United States and Europe. I think that would benefit not just the two blocs but also the rest of the world."
"I would like to support the excellent report of the rapporteur, Mrs Mann, and the courageous proposal put forward by our Commissioner here today, for three reasons."
"Firstly, the TEP is going to give us a possibility of finding a framework to discuss multilateral issues with the United States."
"All those involved in multilateral negotiations know that, unless the European Union and the United States are prepared effectively, negotiations such as the World Trade groundwork which we expect in the millennium round will not happen."
"That is the first reason."
"Secondly, in terms of a bilateral relationship, looking into the longer term, we are wanting to see a broader partnership."
"It is not US colonialization of European decisions, it is a partnership based on broader economic aspects which will include monetary affairs and some security aspects when the Amsterdam Treaty is signed."
"The last point is that this will not operate, as our rapporteur has said, unless we have parliamentary dialogue - a legislative dialogue - because the problems which we have had on Cuba, the problems which we have on bananas, come from the US Congress and therefore you need a parliamentary dialogue based on equality, balance and substance to be able to make this important initiative succeed."
"Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mrs Mann on her full and thorough report. I would also like to thank Commissioner Brittan for the clarity and determination he showed in his statement last week and in what he said to the House this afternoon."
"Unfortunately, our friends and partners in the United States only understand firm and aggressive language."
"It really is remarkable that last week, as the Council of the European Union was adopting the action plan paving the way for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, our friends in the United States should spring a whole range of unilateral measures on us, in blatant disregard of the rules of the game and in clear violation of the obligations entered into within the World Trade Organisation."
"Unfortunately too, experience has shown that the United States only takes the European Union seriously when we take clear, strong and determined action. This is the case, for instance, when the European Union asks the World Trade Organisation to set up a panel to deal with extraterritorial legislation, as was the case for the Helms-Burton Act."
"However, we are not respected if we allow matters to run on."
"I believe that, as Mr Brittan put it so well this afternoon, the United States, flaunting its obvious irresponsibility, has placed itself above the law. It has replaced, or rather, hopes to replace, the rule of law with the rule of force."
"I feel that the European Union as a whole has displayed abundant prudence, caution and goodwill when handling transatlantic relations. Therefore, Mr President, I believe the time has come for the Commission to respond in kind now that we have the ability to suspend the negotiations until reason and good sense prevail."
"Thank you, Mr Salafranca."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0705/98)."
"In its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission would point out that Article 107 of the Treaty guarantees the independence of the ECB and of the national central banks when carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by the Treaty and by the Statute of the ESCB."
"The Commission would recall here that the primary objective of the ESCB is to maintain price stability."
"Article 105 of the Treaty adds that without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2."
"These objectives are concerned, among other things, with promoting sustainable and non-inflationary growth and a high level of employment and social protection."
"There is no need for the Commission to present a new proposal."
"In accordance with the Treaty it has always paid attention to the specific share of investment expenditure in general government deficits, as witness its recommendation of 25 March 1998 concerning qualification of the Member States for participation in the third stage of economic and monetary union."
"The Commission would, however, point out that sustainable growth is not possible without a reduction in public deficits, that the reduction in public deficits is not incompatible with a sustained level of investment and that the golden rule - namely, that the public deficit should be smaller than the volume of public investment - is a principle of sound fiscal conduct."
"In this connection, I can inform you that the Commission is preparing a report on the economic, fiscal and investment strategy for the Vienna European Council which will follow the Pörtschach European Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would simply like to ask whether you have heard about the statement made by Mr Strauss-Kahn and Mr Lafontaine at the latest German-French summit, which raised the issue of suspending the Stability Pact in a few years."
"What is the Commission's opinion on this issue, and what indeed is its view of the independence of the European Central Bank?"
"Are additional security measures necessary here?"
"I do not have the exact details concerning the matter you referred to."
"Perhaps it might be better if my colleague, Commissioner de Silguy, answered the matter in writing."
"I would just say that the Commission would be happy with a debate between the ECB and finance ministers."
"That is quite understandable because independence does not necessarily mean isolation."
"I will be quite happy to convey your point of view to Commissioner de Silguy."
"Question No 43 by Robert Evans (H-1023/98)"
"Subject: Reciprocity for pensioners' concessions in the EU"
"Would the Commission agree that pensioners travelling to other European Union countries should expect to be able to benefit from concessions, with particular regard to travel and cultural activities from which pensioners who are nationals of the state they are visiting are able to benefit from?"
"One of my constituents recently visited Italy. On seeing that entry to a monument was free for pensioners, he asked for that concession."
"He was shocked to hear from the staff that the concession applied only to Italian pensioners."
"A recognised card for the over-sixties would help to avoid this problem and ensure that pensioners received the concessions to which they are entitled across the EU."
"Could the Commission inform me if there has been any progress following the adoption of the Commission Recommendation of 10 May 1989 (89/350/EEC ) on this subject?"
"I give the floor to Mr Flynn to answer Mr Evans' question."
"The Commission agrees with the honourable Member's view that it is desirable that pensioners travelling to other European Union countres should be facilitated in claiming discretionary concessions available to pensioners from the state which they are visiting."
"Regrettably, the Commission knows that in practice such discretionary concessions are not always freely accessible to nationals from the state other than the one which is offering the concessions."
"The Court of Justice has examined several complaints of discrimination against nationals of other Member States as recipients of services, for example, to reduced or free entry to museums and other public buildings and reductions in transport fares."
"The Court, basing itself on Article 6 concerning discrimination on grounds of nationality and Article 59 on freedom to provide services, has consistently condemned discriminatory practices."
"The Commission will continue to be vigilant in upholding respect for basic principles of Community law and will, wherever appropriate, have recourse to the Court of Justice."
"Furthermore, for almost ten years, the Commission has been negotiating with Member States on the introduction of a European Union-wide over-60s card as called for in the Commission's recommendation of 10 May 1989."
"The implementation of this recommendation has been hindered by practical difficulties in a number of Member States."
"In order to take the matter forward, the Commission supported a first feasibility study on this issue during the European Year for Older People in 1993."
"The Commission launched a second feasibility study in 1995 aimed at updating and deepening the first one."
"The final report on this study has been received and copies have been given to the members of the European Parliament Intergroup on Ageing."
"The report has also been presented to the NGO members of the liaison group for older people."
"The conclusions and recommendations of the report still have to be examined and discussed further with the representatives of the Member State governments."
"While there is some cause for optimism in the Commissioner's response, there are also some worries."
"This is an important question about building a Europe for the people and when people are refused reductions because they are not residents of a particular Member State this is very damaging to the whole image of Europe."
"The Commissioner referred to the Commission recommendation of ten years ago but it is taking a long time."
"This is something that ought to be supported and which we should all want to come to fruition."
"I am also looking at a similar venture, namely a European youth card."
"As there is nothing to suggest that in ten years' time we will not still be looking at the question of an over-60s card, can the Commissioner give me any cause for optimism on a European students' card?"
"At the moment we seem to be backtracking as much as moving forward."
"Mr Evans, I would not be too optimistic."
"I certainly would not hold my breath on this issue."
"I have been trying for a number of years, without much success."
"There are two main obstacles to a card for older people."
"The nature, the form and the administration vary so much between Member States."
"The whole question of subsidiarity and proportionality raises its head every time I try to move the question forward."
"Some Member States operate a card system, others do not."
"The conditions vary: in some Member States age alone is sufficient, in others age is combined with income or even residence."
"The age of application varies from 58 to 67."
"Many Member States have decentralised and localised administration and services for application."
"The second problem is that the picture is constantly changing."
"There is a lot of commercialisation and privatisation, particularly in transport, and a lot of the responsibility is in the hands of private and semi-public agencies."
"So it has not gone well and I am finding it extremely difficult to reach a point where we can coordinate the whole system."
"I would like to think it could happen but, as you say, it has proved impossible so far and I do not see any great hope for the immediate future."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner for his reply to the question by Mr Evans."
"I certainly hope the Commission will consider bringing forward detailed proposals for a card for the over-60s in the foreseeable future, even given the difficulties."
"Would the Commissioner like to take this opportunity to condemn the ageism which is widespread throughout the European Union and is still a major problem?"
"I just wish to say that the Commission has already announced its intention in the 1998 to 2000 social action programme to launch a debate on the use of the future Article 13."
"Article 13 provides for appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial and ethnic origin, religion, belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"So we are examining the possibility of legislation as soon as the Treaty is ratified."
"I have just announced our intention under the programme to present a communication on the issues you have referred to as part of our contribution to next year's United Nations Year."
"We will have an opportunity to discuss the matter further at that time."
"Mr Flynn, if you hold your breath for too long you will do yourself an injury and then you might need the health card."
"I do not know whether you remember that some time ago we, as a Parliament, led an initiative and I presented you with a mock-up of that health card which you assured me you would strive for."
"You told me that in the Republic of Ireland the introduction of the health card was being considered."
"Since it was mentioned by my colleague, Mr Evans, what progress has been made on the introduction of a health card? I remind you that one of the possibilities I suggested to you was that rather than go for a high-tech version we might just go for something which was a very posh E111."
"You know that I support the introduction of this card."
"I have spent a lot of time trying to get it organised."
"It has been extremely difficult because of the difficulties I have outlined to you, but we might be able to make some progress."
"Perhaps more action could be taken at European level to help improve the flow of information."
"It might also be helpful to have an update on the concession schemes that are available and try and promote the identification and exchange of best practice."
"The Commission could consider supporting the development of a website on concession schemes available to older people in the Union."
"I do not whether you think that would be helpful but it might be a first step in breaking the log-jam."
"Question No 44 by Bernie Malone (H-0925/98)"
"Subject: Cancellation of 1999 Year Against Violence Against Women"
"I understand that the 1999 Year Against Violence Against Women has been cancelled at the behest of the Member States."
"Given that this House itself called for the declaration of 1999 as the Year Against Violence Against Women in a Resolution in 1997, can the Commissioner explain why the Commission was insufficiently prepared financially and organisationally for it to go ahead?"
"I should like to welcome Mrs Wulf-Mathies and give her the floor to answer Mr Malone's question."
"Mr President, Mrs Malone, Parliament was late in expressing its wish to declare a Year Against Violence Against Women, with the result that the Commission no longer had time to present a formal proposal, ensure appropriate finance and plan the activities carefully."
"However, in an effort to take Parliament's wishes into account, the Commission proposed a campaign on the subject of violence against women."
"Measures for this were begun following a preparatory meeting under the British Presidency in June 1998."
"The first conference will take place from 1 to 4 December on the role of the police in fighting violence against women, in particular against immigrants."
"This event is partly funded by the DAPHNE programme."
"Another important conference, which the Commission is organising with the German Presidency, will take place next spring."
"One feature of the conference will be the presentation of an analysis of relevant statistics from the Member States."
"This report is currently being drawn up jointly by experts from all Member States and the European Women's Lobby, and will also be financed by the DAPHNE programme."
"The campaign's closing conference will be organised in cooperation with the Finnish Presidency."
"The Commission is also planning an exhibition and several seminars, and will draw up and publish information literature that is to be used for prevention in particular."
"The Member States are being invited to organise events in their own countries that should be aimed at the general public and the non-governmental organisations."
"The Commission has also proposed launching a Eurobarometer survey on this subject in the Member States."
"In addition, a report is to be drawn up for the closing conference to summarise all the measures that have been taken or introduced in the Member States during the campaign."
"We would very much welcome the participation of the applicant countries in this campaign."
"Against this I must say, however, that the implementation, type and scale of the measures will depend on the level of financial and staff resources made available by you for 1999."
"The Commission will therefore not be able to make a final decision on the campaign until the general budget has been passed in December 1998."
"I thank the Commissioner for her reply."
"I do not normally put down questions because I do not like to waste time, but I feel very strongly about this issue."
"I am disappointed that we have not been able to make further progress."
"I wonder if the fact that you did not have enough resources at your disposal has anything to do with the report that was published yesterday by the Court of Auditors, which says that a lot of work is being impeded by people being on short-term contracts."
"I hope that is not the case here."
"Your plans are very laudable and the campaign and the points you have made are very good."
"But we must also take the campaign to the schools. Educational input is very important."
"Mr President, firstly, the problem of late application was due solely to the fact that we have certain deadlines to observe if the Council is to make appropriate decisions, and for this we were simply too late."
"But this has nothing to do with employment contracts in the Commission."
"You are familiar with the Commission communication 'on a medium-term Community action programme on measures providing a Community-wide support to Member States action relating to violence against children, young persons and women'."
"This is a programme that is to run from 2000 to 2004, and it makes sense to accept this proposal for schools too."
"You know that part of this communication and of the action programme is raising public awareness."
"I agree with you that raising this awareness must begin as early as possible so that the public develop information and attitudes that make them reject violence against women and allow joint measures to be organised."
"Question No 45 by Gerard Collins (H-1029/98)"
"Subject: EU support for computer purchases for schools"
"At Shanagolden Primary School in Limerick, in Ireland, a new computer room with eight computers has just been opened which will enable teachers to work with pupils, including remedial pupils, in furthering their education through the use of new technology."
"This only came about as a result of various fund-raising activities and the offer of an interest-free loan."
"Can the Commission outline what support, if any, is available at EU level to support the purchase of computers and/or the fitting out of computer rooms in primary and secondary schools."
"I give the floor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies to answer Mr Collins' question."
"Mr President, Mr Collins, the Commission is heavily involved in improving access for European schools to new information technologies."
"The actions that have already begun or are currently being introduced include the following: firstly, the Action Plan 'Learning in the information society', the aims of which include the networking of European schools, training for teachers and the development of strategies for developing multimedia content."
"Secondly, it includes the Educational Multimedia Task Force, which brings together the educational activities of eight different Community programmes."
"In this context, a joint call for proposals on the subject of educational multimedia was published in December 1996, in which in particular Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, TEN and three research programmes took part."
"One example of the 46 projects selected is the 'European Schoolnet' project, which involves the education ministries of the Member States."
"The Socrates programme is aimed at European cooperation in education and promotes cooperation in these areas, in particular within the context of open and distance learning."
"The proposal for Socrates II provides for a new action that is to promote the critical and responsible use of information technologies in schools and colleges."
"Finally, there are numerous research and development actions under various research programmes, which serve to develop an infrastructure and the resources to use it, to create new tools such as simulations or virtual classrooms and to promote open and distance learning."
"In the Community, provision of equipment for schools, in particular computers, is financed in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity from the budgets of the Member States or local authorities."
"Those areas which are eligible for aid from the Structural Funds receive additional funding from them, some of which has helped to finance suitable computer equipment for vocational training centres and further education institutions, including in Ireland."
"Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"Mr Collins is satisfied with your reply."
"Question No 46 by Marie-Paule Kestelijn-Sierens (H-0968/98)"
"Subject: Authorisation of the Drogenbos incinerator in contravention of European legislation"
"On 21 November 1997 the Flemish Ministry of the Environment authorised the construction of an incinerator at Drogenbos (Flemish Brabant)."
"The construction of this incinerator contravenes, inter alia, the proximity principle, the precautionary principle, Directive 80/779/EEC on air quality limit values and guide values for sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates and Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment."
"Does the Commission consider the complaint lodged by the people living nearby to be justified, and if so, what steps will it take?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies to answer Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens's question."
"Mr President, the Commission is currently investigating several complaints relating to the Drogenbos incinerator which this question refers to."
"In view of these complaints, the Commission asked the Belgian Government for information at the end of August, and it is currently examining the reply from the relevant Belgian authorities."
"If the current investigation confirms that Community environmental law is being violated, the Commission will decide whether infringement proceedings should be instituted in accordance with Article 169."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for her reply, but I should specifically like to know when we can expect a decision from the Commission."
"This is an extremely important problem which needs to be addressed with the utmost urgency, since it concerns an incinerator being built in a densely populated area of one and a half million people where the maximum limits for particulates and cadmium have already been reached."
"I would like to press the Commission to investigate this matter with the utmost urgency."
"Perhaps Mrs Wulf-Mathies could tell us how long it will take for the Commission to reach a decision?"
"Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, we are aware that this is a very sensitive issue."
"This is why we asked the Belgian Government for information, which we received in October."
"Please do not expect me to be able to tell you now how long the investigation will take."
"However, we are aware that this issue is a source of concern for the people from that area and they are therefore entitled to receive a reply from us as soon as possible to confirm whether environmental regulations have been violated."
"Question No 47 by John McCartin (H-0945/98)"
"Subject: Local partnership companies in Ireland"
"Is the Commission aware of the concern of Partnership companies in Ireland (receiving funding under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development under the sub-programme for the 'Integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas') that the programme will be cut short when it has only just got up and running (operational only in 1996)?"
"Will the Commission make a commitment, given the importance of countering disadvantage through such local community effort, to include such a programme in the new Structural Funds regulations?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies to answer Mr McCartin's question."
"Mr President, as we see it, the concern of partnership companies mentioned by Mr McCartin is unfounded."
"It is not the Commission's intention either to introduce reprogramming or to reduce funding."
"On the contrary, the Commission is convinced, on the strength of the information provided by the monitoring committee for the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, that partnership companies will succeed by the end of 1999 in dividing up between the projects all the programme funds available under the TAI Programme II."
"This is particularly important given that it will only be possible to fully disburse the funds allocated to the individual projects in the following year."
"The Commission would be in favour of the national authorities including, in their regional development plan, proposals on ways of promoting integrated development when making plans for the next programming period."
"It acknowledges the progress that was achieved within the current programme in promoting local socio-economic development and in compensating for disadvantages, and is open to proposals on ways of promoting local development and, in particular, combating social exclusion in future as well."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for her very full reply."
"One of my concerns is not actually about this year or next year but about the new programme which starts in the year 2000."
"This did not commence with the present structural funds programme because there was a delay in getting it off the ground, particularly in Ireland."
"At the moment people are just learning what it is about, getting their programme off the ground, and now they are concerned that it might not continue after the end of 1999."
"Will you be making proposals for it to be continued into the next programme so that they have another six years?"
"Mr President, I understand the concern."
"Firstly, it is simply a question of carrying out all appropriations for commitments by the end of 1999, and this means that measures can also still be financed in the year 2000."
"Secondly, the Commission is generally interested in promoting local partnerships in the next programming period as well."
"The only thing is that, without knowing the Irish Government's programme proposals, it would be going too far at this stage to say that they will also be part of future programmes."
"However, since we attach great importance, in the new proposals for structural reform, to local initiatives and, in particular, to local employment initiatives, I am assuming that continuing to promote similar measures in future as part of a programme will be an important concern for all of us."
"Question No 48 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H-0973/98)"
"Subject: Defective work in implementation of Greek Community Support Framework"
"According to information which has come to light in Greece, a great many of the projects jointly funded from the Community budget under the Second Community Support Framework for Greece, particularly road-building, have been carried out in a slipshod manner and, in general, do not meet Community specifications."
"This information came to light following the publication of a report by the expert quality control consultant appointed by the Greek Government. The report notes that for all categories of road-building projects subjected to checks, between 26 % and 95 % of the work was defective."
"This is a particularly serious matter both in terms of the high percentage of defective work and the fact that such work is largely responsible for the high number of accidents and deaths on the roads in Greece."
"Given that these projects are carried out with Community funding, will the Commission say whether it considers such a high percentage of defects to be normal in comparison with the situation in other Member States?"
"Where does responsibility for this situation lie and what does the Commission intend to do to put an end to this unacceptable state of affairs?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies to answer Mr Hatzidakis's question."
"Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis, according to existing Community law, responsibility for carrying out projects cofinanced by the Structural Funds lies exclusively with the Member States. In other words, according to existing law, the Member States must guarantee the required quality."
"Monitoring of these projects is therefore subject to national legislation."
"When the Community Support Framework for Greece was approved for 1994 to 1999, the Greek Government assured the Commission that it would take measures to put right the serious deficiencies occurring in the past in connection with the execution of public works."
"This was particularly important for the Commission given the significant increase in the number of new projects."
"One of the measures included the appointment of an independent special adviser for quality control for projects cofinanced by the Community."
"In fact, the first quarterly report of this body known as ESPEL establishes that there is still a problem of quality."
"However, despite spot checks carried out on the projects, it is still not possible to submit applications for certain projects."
"Therefore, the Joint Permanent Committee, whose members also include representatives of the Commission, made the proposal, accepted by the Greek authorities, to have the projects monitored systematically and thoroughly by a quality control officer from 1 July 1998, and no longer simply by spot checks."
"The results of this second ESPEL inspection are to be presented in two days, that is, on 19 November, at the next meeting of the Community Support Framework Audit Board."
"Only then will it be possible to identify the quality defects for each specific project, to determine who is responsible and, above all, to proceed at the same time according to three groupings. The first of these involves projects with secondary defects that are to be put right by the companies, and the second involves projects with considerable defects that do not affect the safety of transport, for instance, but result in high maintenance costs; these additional costs are to be settled by means of payments to the companies concerned."
"The third category is for projects with serious defects that cannot be repaired, and the companies must put these right at their own expense."
"The Commission has no information that would allow it to make a comparative assessment of quality problems in the individual Member States."
"However, the Commission is in favour of increasing independent quality control in Greece, and it is in close contact with the Greek authorities."
"It shall examine the results of the second ESPEL inspection and shall follow closely further developments to repair project defects with those responsible."
"Mr President, I do not know what to begin with because the subject is far too big to be covered in just one minute."
"Commissioner, whilst you know that all of us MEPs stand up for our regions and for the correct implementation of the Second Community Support Framework, trying to get more money for the forthcoming Santer package, there is unfair treatment here and we denounce that."
"It is a scandal."
"I have the published figures for the second quarter from the report by the Special Quality Control Council, which show that projects not conforming to specifications are found in a very high proportion: concrete materials of poor quality 77 %, substrate material of poor quality 91 %, foundation materials of poor quality 95 %, and so on."
"It is a scandal, Commissioner, and frankly I would have expected a clearer answer."
"To a written question I submitted to you a while ago about the Patras-Athens-Thessaloniki project, you answered that the work had not been put right even though you had asked for that to be done, and that the delay was worrying."
"So I want you to tell me what action you intend to take with the Greek Government, and tell me also, since you say you have comparative figures, what is happening elsewhere."
"Are there such major problems of the order of 95 % in other countries?"
"Sincerely, I ask you for a more specific answer because this is an issue of the first priority for my country."
"Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis, I do not have any figures from other Member States, but of course you know that for years we have been busy hurrying along improvements to the tendering procedures for public procurement. And you also know that the reform of public procurement has necessitated legislative changes that must now also be brought through Parliament by a democratic procedure."
"Therefore, all of this has lasted much longer than what was acceptable to us as well."
"However, we are now well on the way to obtaining really secure data."
"It would be good if, together - you given your responsibility as a Member of Parliament, and we given our responsibility as the Commission -, we now waited for the meeting of the monitoring committee where we could assess the last relevant inspection."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to hear from you which exactly are the projects we are discussing, who are the contractors, and who are those responsible in the various services of the Greek State for monitoring these projects."
"It is impossible for us to find out specific details."
"Secondly, please tell me what procedures have been set in motion for penal sanctions on the grounds of negligence, because in a written answer you gave me, you said that penalties would be imposed but I have heard of no such procedure taking place."
"Do you know anything about that?"
"Thirdly, if those instances of negligence, which are very major, happen to be real, will the return of the funds be demanded?"
"In other words, is it possible that my country will have to return money to the European Union and the Commission?"
"Mr President, I should gladly like to try that."
"I have just pointed out that we have now started a very specific inspection, the results of which are to be discussed on 19 November in the monitoring committee."
"Please appreciate that I do not wish to prejudge the meeting of the monitoring committee here today."
"However, I have made it clear what the consequences are if defects can definitely be proved."
"First and foremost, these are not things which the Commission demands from companies, but which the Member State is obliged to demand, because responsibility for the inspection lies with the Member State."
"We cannot govern within the Member State, nor do we wish to."
"There is not only the principle of subsidiarity, but also the need to separate the powers. However, it is clear that the necessary consequences will be discussed in the joint committees, and this is the case for both the monitoring committee, in which the Commission is also represented, and for this Joint Committee, which was set up because we realised that the system of pubic procurement is not working adequately."
"Due to our discussion in Parliament today, I will also gladly instruct our representative in the monitoring committee not only to be very careful when finding out which problems have actually occurred, but also to make sure that they result in appropriate financial consequences for companies, and naturally consequences under criminal law, where this proves necessary or is indicated."
"But I have to know the facts first before I start quoting criminal law here."
"In this respect, I now consider this discussion to be a further impetus for the representatives of the Commission to take appropriate action at the meeting of the monitoring committee on 19 November."
"Question No 49 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0980/98)"
"Subject: Timetable for Structural Fund negotiations"
"Will the Commission give a breakdown of the timetable for the remaining negotiations concerning the Structural Fund Regulations and the likely period of programme negotiations between the Commission and Member States for Objective 1 and Objective 2?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies to answer Mrs Kinnock's question."
"Mr President, I should like to point out to Mrs Kinnock that the timetable for the negotiations on structural intervention in the new programming period depends of course mainly on when the new Structural Fund Regulations are adopted."
"The Cardiff European Council has declared in this connection that political agreement on the whole package is to be achieved by March 1999 at the latest."
"The Commission was pleased to note that the German Government intends to keep to the Cardiff timetable during its Presidency of the Council, as stated by the German Chancellor, Mr Schröder, in his inaugural speech on 10 October."
"If this is the case, Parliament could agree, in particular, to the proposal for a Structural Fund Regulation with general terms and conditions by the end of the current legislative period."
"The regulation could then be finally adopted in May 1999."
"According to the Commission's proposal, the list of Objective 1 areas is to be drawn up immediately after the regulation has been adopted."
"If we take into account the period of time that is necessary for drawing up the regional development plans and negotiating the Community support frameworks, the Commission's decisions on the distribution of the funds under Objective 1 could therefore be issued in the first quarter of the year 2000."
"The list of eligible areas for Objective 2 could be adopted by the Commission in the third quarter of 1999, because the consultation process is longer in this area due to the flexibility that was introduced."
"In the third quarter of the year 2000, the Commission could draw up the plans for the Objective 2 programme and issue the decisions on the distribution of the funds."
"However, this depends on the regulations being adopted by Parliament within the legislative period, that is, in May, and on all the follow-up decisions being promptly taken as well, because things have yet to be put in concrete terms thereafter."
"I think it is therefore truly important that Parliament and the Council give a clear signal that they also intend to keep to this timetable."
"I hope very much that Parliament at least will do this tomorrow at the first reading on the reform of the Structural Funds."
"You may rest assured that the Commission has the greatest interest in urging all those concerned to fulfil their specific obligations now, so that the areas which need our assistance do not suffer as a result of the present standstill in the decision-making process."
"I thank the Commissioner for a very comprehensive answer."
"Could the Commissioner say what formula the Commission will be using to allocate Structural Fund resources to the Objective 1 areas for the period 2000 to 2006?"
"In the interests of transparency - and far be it from me to suggest that the Commission would not always want to be transparent on these issues - would the Commission do us the favour of publishing the formula it intends to adopt?"
"I should gladly like to do that, because we do in fact agree on the principle of transparency."
"We should like to make it clear that the basis of calculation and the indicators are transparent and can be understood by everyone."
"We are therefore currently in the process of preparing a paper which will be made available to the Council and of course to the appropriate committee."
"I have two supplementary questions, the first of them on Objective 6 areas."
"I am keen to discover how much headway has been made with regard to Sweden and Finland. The matter was raised during the accession negotiations in 1992."
"The criteria agreed upon then still hold good, and I wonder whether they will apply unchanged with the transfer to Objective 1."
"In the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament, it would also be useful to iron out any uncertainties as to what is going to happen in the various Member States with regard to the Structural Funds."
"Both MEPs and the public at large would benefit from clear information from the Commission on this point."
"You know that, should there be delays, it is not because of the Commission, and I still hope that we will also manage through a joint effort to bring the discussions on the Structural Funds to a close in May, that is, before you begin the election campaign."
"The Commission already submitted its proposals in March this year, and in this respect, more concrete results could have been achieved had they been wanted."
"However, it is now up to the Council, and I hope that the Council will ultimately remain loyal to the decisions it made in Cardiff."
"As far as Objective 6 is concerned, the principles applying to Finland and Sweden, which were laid down in their treaties of accession, are being retained; the one exception is a region in Finland which is going to be a genuine Objective 1 area, and which will be improved in accordance with this status."
"However, as was already said, this is the Commission's proposal, and the Council and Parliament still have to agree to it."
"Question No 50 by Reinhard Rack (H-1011/98)"
"Subject: Future substance of the Community's Interreg initiative"
"The details of the future framework conditions for the new objectives 1, 2 and 3 are now beginning to emerge very clearly."
"The same is not true of the Community initiatives."
"In particular I should like to know what priorities the future Interreg initiative will contain, whether one of these will be the promotion of the regions at the EU's external borders - which the European Parliament has called for by a large majority - and what type of measures the Commission considers to be worth supporting in the context of promoting the regions bordering on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe?"
"I give the floor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies to answer Mr Rack's question."
"Mr President, I should like to point out to Mr Rack that the Commission has proposed continuing and reinforcing the Community's Interreg initiative."
"It believes that in future this should comprise three forms of cooperation."
"Firstly, cooperation between neighbouring border regions with a view to developing integrated cross-border economic and social areas, as well as close cross-border cooperation in all other areas."
"Secondly, transnational cooperation between regional and national authorities with a view to promoting the economic integration of peripheral regions, and closer European integration, as well as deepening cooperation in regional development."
"Thirdly, interregional cooperation with a view to exchanging practical knowledge and proven methods, as well as promoting the transfer of know-how between the regions in question."
"As you know, only measures within the Member States can be financed under Interreg."
"However, Interreg measures in the regions bordering on the applicant countries are linked to the PHARE cross-border measures, under which cross-border cooperation is financed in the PHARE countries."
"This includes a large number of measures in areas such as economic cooperation, environmental protection, infrastructure, policies for small and medium-sized enterprises, tourism, and so on."
"The Commission has embarked upon reform of the PHARE-CBC regulation."
"The aim of this reform is to make cross-border cooperation more efficient, and to reinforce the cross-border nature of measures by means of common structures and common programmes."
"As regards the nature of the measures taken, the PHARE-CBC arrangements are to be brought into line with Interreg procedures in order to facilitate genuine cross-border cooperation and, if you so wish, to make the PHARE-CBC instrument a pre-accession Interreg instrument, so that together we can also learn how to cooperate across borders."
"Commissioner, what you have just summarised in your answer shows that we have already come a very long way particularly on this important matter, and above all, that we have gone in the right direction for the regions, but also particularly for you as the Commissioner responsible."
"The question which is always asked in this connection, of course, is the question of how much."
"Interreg was previously one of 15 Community initiatives, and funds were therefore not abundant, at least in the previous support period."
"How does the situation look for the next support period, as far as you can tell?"
"Mr President, Mr Rack, the funds are being extended in any case because, as you know, Interreg will no longer be one of 13 initiatives in future, but one of three, according to the Commission's proposal. I can only ask Parliament to now also oppose a whittling away of Community initiatives."
"In addition, the Commission has always believed that Interreg should be the most important of these three, and this could mean that around 50 % of the funds for Community initiatives - that is, from the Community initiatives' total 5 % slice of the cake - should be given to Interreg."
"However, this relies firstly on the Member States accepting the 5 % figure."
"This is still being disputed in the Council at present."
"Secondly, it requires that we resist all attempts to add further initiatives, because it is clear that the funds would then automatically have to be made available for more initiatives, with the result that Interreg would then also suffer financially."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with that question by Mr Rack, we have come to the end of the time set aside for questions to Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"I should like to thank her for attending."
"Since we have no more time for questions to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, Question No 51 by Mr Schröder will receive a written answer."
"Question No 52 by José Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (H-0923/98)"
"Subject: US-Cuba relations"
"Is the Commission aware of the letter of 3 August sent by Mrs Albright, United States Secretary of State, to Mr Helms, Chairman of the US Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, which was published by newspapers and other media?"
"Does the Commission intend to respond to this letter or take a stance on this matter?"
"Does the Commission consider that the interpretation placed on the terms of the declarations of 18 May by the US Secretary of State is in keeping with the spirit of the remarks made to the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs in May by the Commissioner responsible?"
"Does the Commission agree that this agreement represents an extraordinary reaffirmation of the principles underlying the Liberty Act?"
"I should like to welcome Sir Leon and give him the floor to answer Mr Salafranca's question."
"The Commission is aware of the letter from Secretary Albright to Senator Helms regarding the understanding on investment disciplines."
"We discussed it with Secretary Albright during the ministerial meeting in Vienna in September and the Commission informed her that there were several parts of the letter which the Commission would not have written."
"The Commission does not believe that it is desirable or useful to focus on differences in the presentation of the understanding on investment disciplines."
"The text of the understanding itself is detailed and explicit."
"It is a text which we will respect and implement when a title for waiver of the Helms-Burton Act is granted."
"Commissioner, I would be grateful for further clarification on two points."
"The day after the General Affairs Council at which the terms of the Transatlantic Summit's declaration on extraterritorial legislation, and more specifically, the Helms-Burton Act, were noted, you appeared before this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. On that occasion you stated that if the United States did not fulfill its part of the agreements - I refer in particular to the amendment of Title IV -, the agreements would lapse."
"Were this to prove the case, you did not rule out the possibility of again initiating proceedings in some way before the bodies of the World Trade Organisation."
"The question I should like to put to you, Commissioner, is as follows: what, in the Commission's opinion, is a reasonable period of time to allow the United States to amend Title IV of the Act?"
"Is President Clinton's term of office a reasonable period?"
"Or what about the present Commission's term of office?"
"Or perhaps the term of office of the next President of the United States is the appropriate period of time?"
"What exactly do you have in mind?"
"Moving on to my second point, Commissioner, I would like you to confirm that you did have the opportunity of meeting with the Chairman of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Gilman, and also with Congressman Bob Menéndez during your latest visit to Washington. Also, I would like you to state whether or not it is true that you - or the European Commission - were asked to put in writing your position with regard to the content of Mrs Albright's letter to Senator Helms."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to know whether you are in receipt of any communication from the United States' Congress on this matter, requesting the Commission to state its position on the content of the letter in question."
"The position is, that we will not carry out our part of the agreement if the United States does not carry out its part."
"We have not set a deadline."
"I had a number of meetings with Congressional leaders including Mr Gilman during a recent visit to the United States in which I put our position and the United States seemed more prepared to understand it."
"Above all, the reasons we have not concerned ourselves to set a deadline is that, for the moment, under the agreement, the United States is taking no action against any European company under either Title 3 or Title 4 and has indicated that not only does Total get a waiver agreement but anybody else who invests in Iran on comparable terms will similarly get a waiver."
"They are not implementing their law and we are not subject to it."
"Although the Commissioner has told us, the United States, is not at present implementing the Helms-Burton law in certain respects, is he aware of the fact that many European businessmen have been intimidated into refusing to take the risk of incurring liability under Title 3 and Title 4 of the bill and, if they have had relations with the United States, have preferred to limit relations with Cuba or not have any at all."
"In these circumstances, will there not come a time when, although no deadline has been set, further action will have to be taken to protect European businessmen from the effects of this situation."
"They seem to be pretty well protected by the understanding that we have because they are apparently piling into Cuba."
"Question No 53 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0976/98)"
"Subject: Negotiations on the MAI"
"The OECD negotiations on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) resumed some time ago."
"The draft agreement which was negotiated during the spring has been sharply criticised by the European Parliament and others."
"What changes does the Commission wish to see made to the agreement that was negotiated in spring?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Sjöstedt's question."
"This is, of course, a complicated question."
"Since it was tabled I made a Commission statement in the plenary session of 20 October."
"That remains an accurate statement of the current position, and I would refer to it."
"I should like to extend sincere thanks to the Commission for that answer, which was brief and to the point."
"My question is no longer entirely relevant in any case. It was in fact put down before the good news reached us that the French Government was withdrawing from the MAI negotiations."
"It now looks probable that new negotiations will be started up within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"I wonder if the Commission believes that the draft agreement produced at OECD level would constitute a sound basis for these WTO negotiations."
"Or would it be preferable to begin again from scratch, given that the situation has now changed?"
"As I explained in the debate, the position is that we favoured an agreement in the OECD."
"The negotiations have not been terminated but, being frank about it, I indicated that the prospects were not good."
"If we had had an agreement in the OECD, or if we have one, that seems to me to be a good prelude to negotiation in the WTO, which has not yet been agreed but which we have argued in favour of."
"If there is no agreement in the OECD, I still think that the right thing to do is to commence negotiation in the WTO."
"So that is the course we would favour, irrespective of what happens in the OECD."
"Question No 54 by Richard Howitt (H-1031/98)"
"Subject: The World Trade Organisation and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment"
"Given the recent actions of the French Government, will the European Commission now support the removal of talks on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) from the OECD to the World Trade Organisation (WTO)?"
"Will the Commissioner ensure that equal weight is given to responsibilities of investors under such an agreement as to rights vis-à-vis nation states?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Howitt's question."
"As I said in the debate I referred to in answer to the previous question, I have always believed that the WTO is the best place in the long term to create a predictable framework of investment rules."
"I am glad we have made some progress in starting down that road at the WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore."
"It is important that at the meeting next autumn we should continue to press the case for negotiation and ultimate agreement on investment in the WTO."
"Meanwhile, there have been the negotiations on the MAI in the framework of the OECD."
"We have participated in those negotiations but the chances of bringing them to a successful conclusion do not look promising at the moment."
"So we need to consider what would be the best way forward now in order to deal with the situation and get negotiations going in the WTO in any event."
"Could I ask the President-in-Office to comment on the second part of my question, in particular the need to incorporate binding regulatory standards, especially in the areas of labour, the environment, investment incentives and restrictive business practices in any new multilateral agreement on investment, alongside rights for investors."
"I am very pleased that the British Government, as reported on 13 November in the Guardian , has said that Ministers have decided the way forward is to include labour standards and environmental concerns from the outset."
"I hope that the Commission will take that view in its relations with the WTO."
"I should also like to ask the Commissioner if he will ensure that as far as the WTO is concerned, there is full consultation with civil society and NGOs and that labour issues are taken into account?"
"There has not been an agreement that there should be a negotiation in the WTO."
"I very much hope that we will get that but there is strong resistance from a number of developing countries."
"So it would be altogether premature to talk about the nature of our negotiating mandate for a negotiation that does not currently exist."
"The short answer is that there is none at the moment but there will have to be one in due course."
"As for consultation with civil society, that is enormously important."
"The Commission organised a very large meeting with representatives from a very large number of NGOs, as well as others concerned, yesterday in Brussels on the whole range of WTO negotiations."
"As Mr Barton is not present, Question No 55 lapses."
"Question No 56 by David Bowe (H-1034/98)"
"Subject: Steel"
"What action has the Commission taken in response to the recent court case in the Ohio State Court in the USA which was directly aimed at preventing foreign steel from entering that particular state, an action that appears to be in contravention of US and international law?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Bowe's question."
"On 27 October an Ohio- based steel producer filed an action in the Ohio State Court alleging unfair competition from low-priced steel imports into the state."
"The action was meant to seek restrictions on imports into the state by a number of trading companies as well as Russian and Japanese steel producers."
"This is a highly unusual move by the US steel industry which had already begun to lodge a serious of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy complaints at the federal level in response to the crisis in South-East Asia and Russia."
"On 17 November 1998, however, the Ohio State Court where the case was pending dismissed the action brought by the Ohio corporation."
"Apparently the judge decided that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief under state law."
"The Commission is monitoring the further progress of the case as there may well be an attempt to seek relief before a federal court."
"I thank the Commissioner for that reply which I found very interesting."
"I would also bring to his attention some more recent events."
"In the steel industry journal The Metal Bulletin of 12 November it said that US steel company executives and trade union representatives met a few days ago with President Clinton in order to push their case for exceptional protection against steel imports."
"While the report goes on to say that no decision has yet been taken, the companies are pressing for a change to the injury standard of the so-called 201 market safeguard rule which would make it easier for the Americans to shut down their market to imports but stay within WTO rules."
"If the American Government gives in to this type of pressure, what is the European Union - and the Commission in particular - going to do to protect its steel companies?"
"It would be unwise to speculate on what we would do in a certain speculative event but I can tell you one thing."
"We would certainly wish to ensure that the United States acted in accordance with WTO rules."
"As far as Europe is concerned, EUROFER has been to see me and has indicated that it will be putting forward a complaint alleging that there has been dumping and possibly other unlawful trading activities in the steel industry."
"If we receive that complaint we will obviously give it very serious attention."
"But the proper procedure would have to be gone through and I could not begin to anticipate what the outcome would be."
"Question No 57 by Graham Watson (H-1035/98)"
"Subject: China-Taiwan relations"
"What discussions has the Commission had recently with the Chinese authorities concerning its relations with Taiwan?"
"I give the floor to Sir Leon to answer Mr Watson's question."
"The latest contact that we had with the Chinese on the subject of Taiwan was in July 1998 when the Commission's Deputy Director-General in DG I, Mr Gérard Depayre, explained to an envoy from the Chinese mission to the EU the content and purpose of our bilateral WTO market access agreement which I signed - the record of the negotiations - with the Taiwanese Minister Wang in Brussels on 23 July."
"Since then there has been no official contact with the Chinese authorities on the question of Taiwan."
"We do not recognise Taiwan as a separate sovereign nation but rather as a separate customs territory with which we have had increasingly intense economic and commercial links. We attach great importance to our economic and commercial links with both China and Taiwan so we must be available to discuss these relations as and when necessary."
"Please allow me to declare an interest."
"I went with a group of other Members of this House from different countries and different political groups to Taiwan last week at the invitation of their Ministry of Foreign Affairs to observe their election campaign."
"I led a similar group there in 1995."
"Taiwan is a free and open democracy."
"They have made tremendous strides towards democracy."
"It is the world's 14th largest trading nation."
"As a result of being a free and open democracy with a transparent economy they have come well out of the financial turmoil."
"Would you not agree, Commissioner, that Taiwan is a beacon for democracy in the region and that the isolation of Taiwan is increasingly anomalous?"
"Will the Commission support Taiwan's early entry into the WTO and greater links between the European Union and the Republic of China?"
"Mr Watson knows the official position of the Commission and indeed Member States with regard to Taiwan."
"Our links with Taiwan are very strong."
"They are economic and commercial though."
"In those circumstances I do not think it would be appropriate for me to comment on political developments in Taiwan."
"But I would say, with regard to the other points that have been made, we are negotiating in good faith and rather successfully with Taiwan on its admission to the WTO."
"We have made very good progress on the market access question."
"There are other aspects that still have to be considered."
"We will negotiate with Taiwan on those other aspects without delay and seek to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"More generally, as far as the economic and commercial links with Taiwan are concerned, I entirely agree with what has been said."
"It is a territory that has been extremely successful economically, even in the context of the current problems in Asia."
"There is enormous further potential for the development of economic and commercial links with the European Union."
"Question No 58 by Paul Rübig (H-0924/98)"
"Subject: Directives on the recognition of diplomas and discrimination against consultant engineering firms"
"The first and second directives on the recognition of diplomas govern entitlement to exercise a profession, or rather the evidence entitling a person to pursue a regulated profession in an EU Member State."
"The term 'diploma', however, includes not only school leaving certificates and university degree certificates but also a number of training and examination certificates such as, for example, those required in Austria as proof of qualifications for a licence to exercise a regulated profession."
"However, some Member States, Italy for instance, interpret the directive very restrictively, only recognising, for the purposes of granting licences to consultant engineering firms, degrees from universities and higher education establishments."
"This practice has even led to the prosecution of Austrian citizens for illegal exercise of the profession of engineer."
"How does the Commission intend to react to this possible discrimination against consultant engineering firms with regard to the exercise of their profession within the internal market?"
"I should like to welcome Mr Monti and give him the floor to answer Mr Rübig's question."
"As the honourable Member has pointed out, within the meaning of Directives 89/48/EEC and 92/51/EEC the term 'diploma' may include not only school leaving certificates and university degrees, but also a number of training and examination certificates."
"The directives relating to the general system of recognition of diplomas make no provision for coordination of training nor for automatic recognition of vocational qualifications."
"Each Member State is free to stipulate what qualifications are required to exercise an occupation or profession within its own borders."
"Thus Italy is entitled to permit only graduates from universities and higher education establishments to practise as consultant engineers."
"Practitioners from other Member States must be treated in the same way as Italian citizens."
"Infringement of the rules in force in the individual Member States may lead to the opening of legal proceedings, provided that any sentences are proportionate to the seriousness of the violation."
"Austrian citizens wishing to practise as consultant engineers in Italy must submit an application to this effect to the competent authorities."
"Should it emerge that there is a significant difference between the qualifications laid down by law in Italy and those required of Austrian citizens to practise that profession, the Italian authorities may invite the Austrian citizen to opt for an equalisation measure such as, for example, a training period or an aptitude test."
"If, as appears to be the case, the Austrian practitioners possess only lower-level diplomas such as those provided for in Directive 92/51/EEC, the Italian authorities may require an equalisation measure to be applied in all cases."
"It will be clear from what I have said that the general position of the Italian authorities does not conflict with the provisions of Community law."
"I might add that, here as in other spheres, should any specific individual cases prove problematic, the Commission is prepared to examine them and check on their compliance with Community law."
"Mr President, it appears in practice that an engineer in Austria may provide a service which meets market requirements, and that when he provides the same service in Italy or in another Member State, it is then no longer admissible."
"How do you intend to deal in future with these problems which constitute obstacles for the internal market?"
"Here the relevant distinction is the one introduced at the Fontainebleau summit back in 1984."
"Indeed, ever since the Fontainebleau summit the vertical sectoral approach - that is, specific directives - for specific jobs and occupations has been replaced by a horizontal approach, in other words the general system based on semi-automatic recognition of qualifications without prior harmonisation of education and training systems."
"Generally speaking, the Commission is not in favour of proposing new specific directives."
"In these cases, therefore, the host country is entitled to restrict the exercise of a certain occupation to holders of university and higher education degrees, and then - as I said - a citizen from another Member State may opt either for an aptitude test or a training period."
"The alternative to this system would be highly detailed regulatory provisions: these are appropriate for certain jobs and occupations but not for others."
"Question No 59 by Antonios Trakatellis (H-0940/98)"
"Subject: Decision on complaint concerning the Thessaloniki underground railway and implementation of Community legislation on public contracts"
"Almost four years since the Thessaloniki underground rail project was incorporated in the section of the 2nd CSF for Greece (1994-1999) entitled 'Improvement in living conditions', and almost two years since a complaint was made to the Commission that the project was in breach of Community legislation on public contracts, the only progress has been the transfer of ECU 26 million of the ECU 60.7 m of the Community's total contribution."
"According to the Commission's announcement in July, it had taken a decision on the complaint, on the authorization of Commissioner Monti."
"Will the Commission, therefore, say whether it has taken a final decision on the complaint, what that decision is and whether it may be overturned in the light of new information?"
"If that is so, how can the Commission ensure a swift review of the case when it took 18 months to make any statement on the complaint?"
"In view of the fact that the Greek Ministry for Public Works has announced that the contract has been signed, can work commence without further complication due to controversy over the contract?"
"Did examination of the complaint reveal any shortcoming in the implementation of Community directives on public contracts in relation to this project and, if so, how will the Commission ensure that the law is upheld in the future?"
"I give the floor to Mr Monti to answer Mr Trakatellis's question."
"The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that it has dropped the case concerning the Thessaloniki underground railway, by Decision H/98/3262 of 27 August 1998, given that it did not come across any breach of the principle of equal treatment."
"The competent authorities in Greece were informed in a letter dated 18 September 1998."
"Before arriving at the decision to drop the case, the Commission requested and obtained from the Greek authorities a guarantee that future calls for tender, in particular ones relating to contracts of a similar scale, will be drawn up and implemented with the greatest care, so as to avoid difficulties and delays of the kind which have occurred in the tender procedure for the Thessaloniki underground railway."
"The Commission would point out that, as always, should any new facts come into its possession relating to an infringement of Community legislation, it could decide to open a new procedure to verify the legality of the situation."
"However, the facts of which we are aware thus far do not justify such action."
"If valid reasons for reopening proceedings were to arise in the future, which - I repeat - is not the case at present, the Commission would certainly require considerably less time to assess the new facts, because the substance of the matter has already been investigated in depth."
"Finally, as concerns the state of advancement of the project itself, the Commission considers that all further developments must be the sole responsibility of the competent authorities in Greece."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer."
"Firstly, I would like you to tell me this, please: you have already said that when new figures emerge clearly from the agreement signed between the Greek state and the contractor, we will be able to make an approach to the Commission with those new figures."
"I would therefore like to ask you: if an approach is made, can the work begin and can payments be made, or do we first have to wait for the Commission's decision and only then begin the work?"
"Secondly, given that there has been an exchange of correspondence between you, Mr Monti, and the Greek Government, for the sake of more complete parliamentary monitoring and greater transparency I would like a copy at least of your own letter to the Greek Government."
"Finally, time marches on inexorably, Commissioner, towards the end of the Second Community Support Framework."
"Will it be possible for the work to begin and for payments to be made before then?"
"I would add in reply to Mr Trakatellis that - as I have said - if new and different facts arise in relation to a case, it is always possible to reopen proceedings."
"I would stress that, in this case, none of the information which has so far come to light justifies such action."
"Therefore, as far as the Commission is concerned, this case has been dropped in the same way as all others are dropped: the relevant proceedings have been closed."
"New and different facts would be required in order for it to be reopened, but that is not the situation at present."
"Commissioner, you said that you have shelved the matter until you receive new figures, but that at the same time you have told the Greek authorities that in future they should handle things differently from the way in which they dealt with the Thessaloniki metro contract."
"So the conclusion I draw is that the procedures followed had certain deficiencies."
"Politically, therefore, the procedures were not transparent."
"Legally, however - since I am a lawyer - you may indeed have shelved the matter, but the comment that in future such practices should be avoided means that the practice followed was incorrect, that it lacked transparency, that it infringed Community regulations, in other words that someone could go to court solely on the basis of what you have just told us, and blow the contract to pieces."
"The question, therefore, is: will the project go ahead?"
"What do you think of the syllogism I have stated, because you cannot both grant approval and say that in future the Greek Government must avoid such practices."
"You must do one or the other."
"Our approach in the matter under discussion was to assess whether or not Community legislation on public contracts had been breached."
"In examining the complaint, the Commission found that the voluminous contract documentation contained provisions on the specific conditions demanded which were open to differing interpretations by bidders."
"Nevertheless, in view of the complexity of the procedure and of the contract documentation, the Commission finally concluded that the awarding authority could not be said to have deliberately operated a tender procedure which was not genuinely competitive."
"It was not possible in this context to prove that a clear infringement of the principle of equal treatment had taken place; that would have meant opening the appropriate proceedings."
"As far as the future is concerned, I can say that the guarantees sought by the Commission take the form of the experience acquired by the Greek administration and its advisers in designing and completing projects of this type; these guarantees are backed by a firm undertaking regarding their future conduct."
"Naturally we shall continue to remain vigilant."
"Question No 60 by Sören Wibe (H-0951/98)"
"Subject: Parallel imports into the EEA"
"One of the effects of a judgment delivered by the European Court of Justice in summer 1998 is to prevent parallel imports of branded clothing from countries outside the EEA."
"Sweden has protested in the Council against this ruling, as it affects Swedish consumers and retailers."
"Sales of parallel imports in Sweden are worth SKr 30 bn a year."
"Naturally enough, then, parallel imports have a very significant effect on Swedish consumers' personal finances."
"The Commission has now resumed a study of the pros and cons of parallel imports (which according to Svenska Dagbladet of 29 September 1998 had been shelved), the findings of which are to be presented to the Council."
"When will the study be ready?"
"What will happen in the meantime?"
"Does the Commission not think it would be better to defend consumers' interests rather than those of general agents?"
"I give the floor to Mr Monti to answer Mr Wibe's question."
"In its judgment of 16 July 1998 in the Silhouette case, the Court of Justice upheld the principle that the holders of trade marks in the Community have the right, on the basis of those trade marks, to object to parallel imports into the European Union of products originally placed on the market elsewhere."
"This bears out the Commission's interpretation of the 1989 directive on trade marks."
"Consequently, importers and retailers may not import branded products into the Community without the consent of the holder of the relevant trade mark."
"This also means that the Member States must apply the current Community rules on trade marks in accordance with the interpretation given by the Court of Justice in its recent judgment."
"I am aware of the reactions provoked by this judgment in a limited number of countries, and particularly in Sweden."
"Concern has been expressed that consumers are being deprived of the opportunity, thanks to parallel imports, of buying branded products at cheaper prices."
"These concerns are, however, only partially justified."
"I would stress that the protection of intellectual property rights is crucially important in developing innovation in Europe."
"European producers invest vast quantities of money and know-how to create new high-quality products, build up the prestige of their brands and organise their distribution networks."
"It should be noted here that, although parallel imports enable consumers to benefit from lower prices in the short term, in the longer term reduced profits might discourage the holders of trade marks from investing in their brands or from competing actively with other brands, which would be disadvantageous for the entire sector."
"Let us be absolutely clear about one thing: parallel imports within the Community and also, more broadly, within the EEA are a key element of the single market, and the current discussions concerning the exhaustion of the right conferred by a trade mark do not revolve around this fundamental element, but relate only to parallel imports from outside the Community."
"I would point out, finally, that in order to gain a complete picture of the situation, a study is being undertaken of the economic consequences of the exhaustion of the right conferred by a trade mark in the Community; it is to be completed in the early part of 1999."
"This study will consider the various aspects of trade mark protection and the possible consequences of a change in the exhaustion system, in particular as concerns product availability, after-sales service, advice to consumers, investment in new products, price competition and employment."
"I have a very brief supplementary question, which I shall preface by saying that I disagree with the Commissioner on parallel imports."
"This ruling is tantamount to a ban on retail activity."
"I fail to see the economic rationale from anyone's point of view, including that of the manufacturers."
"My question is as follows. If parallel imports to various Swedish retailers continue, does the Commission intend to instigate legal proceedings against Sweden?"
"Given the situation which has been corroborated by the judgment of the European Court of Justice, the holders of trade marks are at liberty to demand the appropriate legal action."
"This does not affect the Commission; the Commission must see to it that trade mark holders are in a position to exercise this right."
"I am very pleased to see the Commissioner here."
"I did not think you would be in Strasbourg today because you did not attend the Duty-Free Intergroup."
"We had to cancel it, even though you had earlier said that you would attend."
"I took the floor to say that it is a shame that we cannot now deal with the two items on duty-free that are on the agenda and that some of us have come here to deal with."
"We get very little opportunity to speak to the Commissioner."
"We are trying very hard to change his mind on this issue with a very important report going to the ECOFIN ministers, which has just been completed by the Commission."
"I would like to cross-examine the Commissioner on this report, on the implications of duty-free for jobs."
"Mrs Malone, Mr Monti, this is not within the scope of the question under consideration. Also, the time allowed has elapsed."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, you may take the floor if you wish."
"I believe that this is a very important matter - and I have had occasion to speak on it both here in the plenary and in various parliamentary committees - but it is wholly unrelated to the question asked by Mr Wibe."
"I would therefore not wish to comment any further, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"Mr Gallagher has also asked for the floor to put a supplementary question further to Mr Wibe's question."
"I would ask you both to confine yourselves, please, to the context of the question put by Mr Wibe."
"I appreciate the time constraints, but I should like to take this opportunity while Commissioner Monti is in the House."
"He has on numerous occasions in the past referred to structural funds as an instrument to be used to overcome the consequences of the abolition of duty-free."
"I would say to the Commissioner that I have to hand a copy of the Commission's working document on the proposals."
"There is absolutely nothing new in this."
"I believe I am being reasonable and fair in saying this document is window-dressing."
"There is nothing more in it than has been available in the past."
"This is no reflection on the Chair or the Commissioner."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would give a number of us who have had questions tabled this evening the opportunity to meet him during the next week or so."
"This is nothing more than window-dressing and it will not address the issues."
"Thank you, Mr Gallagher."
"I did not ask you to stop speaking because that is not my practice, but I did warn you that the issue had been discussed for longer than anticipated and that the time allocated has been exceeded."
"Mr Monti may take the floor if he wishes."
"He is indicating that he does not wish to do so."
"Since the time allowed for Question Time to the Commission has now come to an end, Questions Nos 61 to 119 will receive written answers."
"That concludes Question Time to the Commission."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Budget lines for human rights"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the implementation in 1998 of budget lines for human rights and democracy under Chapter B7-70 'European initiative for democracy and the protection of human rights'."
"I give the floor to Mr van den Broek."
"Madam President, thank you for this chance to share our collective concern here with Parliament over some worrying reports which are circulating about the way in which human rights policy is being implemented at the moment."
"I think it is a very good idea to clarify one or two things and then to agree on a few points which may be useful to all the parties concerned in safeguarding this policy on human rights which is very dear to Parliament's heart, but certainly no less dear to the Commission's heart - and that also goes of course for all the organisations which work to protect and promote the upholding of human rights."
"Perhaps I can begin by trying to outline the current state of affairs and then deal with questions and comments of the kind made, for example, in a letter from the vice-chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mendiluce, to the President of Parliament, Mr Gil-Robles."
"When we talk about human rights policy, at least that part of it for which I have direct responsibility, we are talking about part of an ECU 97.4 million budget, that is to say a part which totals ECU 44 to 45 million and is administered by Directorate-General IA. It comes under budget chapter B7-7."
"We are talking about democracy projects, the fostering of democratic development in Eastern Europe, including the new independent states of the former Soviet Union."
"We are talking about more general human rights issues, but also of support for victims of torture."
"We are talking of support for a number of international criminal courts - for example the tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda."
"We are talking about the monitoring of elections."
"Total spending on these projects is ECU 44.7 million."
"Up to the end of May, we had important and valuable outside assistance in managing these funds from the European Human Rights Foundation, with which you are very familiar."
"This Foundation was involved in assessing project proposals, had a great deal of contact with applicants in the course of that work, and handled the post-completion evaluation work and the financial settlement for many of these projects."
"The fact that this assistance has ceased is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the concern which has arisen over management of the budget lines for human rights."
"Before I go into the situation which has arisen following the loss of this outside assistance and answer the question of how, in these circumstances, adequate management can be assured, I first want to tell you where things stand at present concerning the implementation of this budget line."
"To date some 315 applications - project proposals - for aid under the 1998 budget have been received in total."
"All these 315 proposals have been assessed."
"So far, the Commission has given its approval for ECU 19.1 million out of that ECU 44 million."
"This is for some 35 projects, whilst preparations for decisions to be taken in the Commission are largely complete in respect of ECU 18 million, that is to say for about 41 projects."
"So we really expect the Commission to have taken a decision within the next three weeks on 76 projects to a total value of some ECU 37 million - I am still talking about 1998."
"Out of the total sum of 44.7 million, that leaves about five to six million which have already been earmarked for civil society projects in Kosovo."
"The quickest and most effective way of implementing that will be by transferring the sum to the budget line for reconstruction in former Yugoslavia."
"Those submitting project proposals which cannot be accepted will be notified as speedily as possible."
"I should stress that acceptance of a project proposal is based solely on considerations such as quality, and of course the priority which the project merits."
"These are criteria which have been applied in earlier years to project assessment, and in other years too only some, a third to a quarter of all applications, were approved. In other words, over the years there have always been more applications for aid than the budget could fund."
"In itself that is hardly surprising."
"Of course it only makes sense for the Commission to approve these projects if there is also proper follow-up to them, in the form of awarding contracts, implementing the projects and completing the financial settlements."
"There is no denying the fact that the loss of the outside assistance which I referred to before was painful."
"I have the following things to say concerning that loss."
"At the end of 1997, it was decided for reasons of transparency and to encourage fair competition that outside assistance should be obtained by means of an open procedure, that is to say public tendering."
"The aim was to charge the costs of this outside assistance to part B of the budget, to operating appropriations."
"But before the tendering procedure could be taken further, all new commitments for the budget lines for human rights were frozen as a result of the famous Court judgment which was delivered in May of this year."
"Then came our consultation and the interinstitutional agreement of late July which was concluded for the remainder of this budget year, and which thus made it possible for us to enter into new commitments."
"So this was how things got moving again following the Court judgment."
"When it came to a new contract of assistance based on the call for tenders, a complication then arose over whether or not the Commission could draw on outside assistance and fund it from part B of the budget. Honourable Members who sit on the Committee on Budgets will recall the discussion on this matter."
"In view of the nature of the aid required to implement the budget lines for human rights and then assistance both to beneficiaries - i.e. the NGOs - and to the Commission, that is to say the debate over a joint technical assistance office, it was not possible to draw on the operating appropriations."
"The budget remarks for 1998 made no provision for that, and for the same reason it was not possible to draw on part A of the budget line. So the tendering procedure ground to a halt, and with it the chance of obtaining outside assistance."
"So where do we go from here?"
"Given that the regulation proposed by the Commission as a legal base for expenditure on human rights policy has not yet been approved - it is still under discussion by the Council and Parliament - it looks to begin with as if we shall need another interinstitutional agreement in 1999, and fairly quickly."
"Otherwise we shall have no legal base for 1999."
"But we shall also have to ask the budgetary authorities to add some remarks on the budget lines for human rights which will enable us to draw on outside assistance in carrying out these projects."
"Again, it is assistance not only for beneficiaries, but also for the Commission."
"The Commission will make that request before the second reading of the budget."
"These possibilities, namely the interinstitutional agreement on the one hand, plus the question of budget remarks allowing outside assistance on the other, may provide a solution in the shorter term."
"If the appropriate budget remarks are secured for this outside assistance, the Commission can explore all possible ways of obtaining the requisite outside assistance in the short term and perhaps through direct contracts."
"By the end of next year, that should give a greater assurance to all those involved that human rights projects will be properly selected and implemented."
"1999 could then be used for carefully considered decisions on how our human rights policy should be organised in the year 2000 and beyond, because in the meantime we may gain more of an idea, for example as to the areas of implementation in which the new joint service might take part, and at the same time we can study how human rights policy can best fit in to the reorganisation which the Commission is preparing for the field of external relations and which will take effect from the year 2000."
"When we talk about how human rights policy is to be organised in future, there are also possible variants such as the setting-up of a human rights agency."
"But I would prefer to discuss the alternatives with you at a later date, because we feel that for the moment our first priority must be to secure the situation for the rest of this year and for 1999 through an interinstitutional agreement and remarks in the budget."
"That is what I wanted to say to Parliament in the first instance, adding a heartfelt cry of my own that obviously there will time and again be tensions between, on the one hand, the justified plea of Parliament and the human rights organisations too that we should not only provide an opportunity for large-scale projects, but also give smaller organisations and those truly working to develop civil society from the grass roots up a chance in our programmes and, on the other hand, the constant pressure which is understandably exerted on us by the Committee on Budgets, by virtue of their responsibilities, to keep the Commission's use of outside assistance to a minimum."
"Because that is the debate which has been directed at us in recent months."
"I will end by saying this: give us the tools if we are to do the job."
"We cannot keep helping the smaller organisations, which automatically means a lot of projects and thus a fair degree of fragmentation which is sometimes unavoidable, and at the same time be deprived of outside help in implementing these projects."
"I repeat: we are in something of a transitional stage as far as the joint service is concerned, because at present I have no means of knowing exactly how much work the joint service will be taking off our hands."
"This joint service was set up to achieve a certain economy of scale in the implementation of all manner of aid projects."
"I think that what we are putting to you now is the best solution possible and the best guarantee possible for the period from now until the end of next year."
"Madam President, the problem is really threefold: the problems over the legal base which have come down to us from the Council, the question of minibudgets where Parliament has always insisted that agreements entered into should be kept, and finally the somewhat unclear policy and management priorities which we see in the Commission itself."
"If you look at the reports of the Court of Auditors, DG IA is hardly a model of sound management."
"We cannot do much about the legal base for the time being."
"I quite agree with Commissioner van den Broek that we must wait until things have been sorted out by regulations, and that means that the legislators must do their job first before we have any long-term solution."
"The question of minibudgets will remain controversial, but there is one aspect of these which needs to be pointed out, although the Commissioner did not do so."
"We increasingly get into difficulties with the Council over the minibudgets, because they are likely to mean cuts in the operating budget."
"Of course the administrative load is quite heavy with small-scale projects of this kind; in other words, cutting the operating budget becomes very attractive."
"So I think we have to look for solutions other than simple outside assistance, which has to be paid for at the expense of policy."
"And in my view not out of the operating budget, Madam President - I grant the Commissioner that we may not manage to find the right answer here in the short term."
"I think the long-term policy which the Commissioner responsible for budgets has launched within the Commission offers better possibilities, but just now I think that is too difficult."
"These are the problems which are facing us, but what we need are solutions."
"In the longer term, and I agree with the Commissioner here, ad hoc solutions are no longer acceptable."
"We must look for a structure within which we can work to longer deadlines."
"I am quite sure that we cannot achieve it in 1999, but I think 1999 has to be the basis for further developments."
"I am so against ad hoc solutions because they lead to the kind of endless discussions we are seeing now over ECHO or MEDA and that is not good, either for us, for the Commission or the European Union."
"So long-term stability is what we need."
"Madam President, this means that I think the Commission will this year need to find a few extra staff in DG IA to deal with the remaining problems, because I do not know, in all honesty, whether the civil society project in Kosovo is feasible this year."
"I think the situation there is still rather too unstable to allow larger-scale projects to be implemented."
"So I think priority should be given to human rights problems on a rather broader base."
"I wonder too if it might not be possible within the current machinery to make greater use of delegation."
"The Court of Auditors' report repeatedly tells us that we do not really decentralise enough."
"This Commissioner knows full well that in the Netherlands, in the area of development cooperation, ambassadors have little stashes of money which they can spend, subject to certain conditions."
"I think that kind of mechanism should be created to help small projects of this kind."
"That would help us."
"And then we have the proposal for a budget remark."
"It is something of a nuisance to have to add a new remark at the second reading of the budget, but I think that if we can reach an interinstitutional agreement on it, that will solve our problems for 1999, once again with all my reservations about the minibudgets which will automatically follow on from that."
"But again, Madam President, the only solution is a long-term solution, and I look to the Commission for a proposal on that in the very near future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I do not wish to blame you for this evening's empty house, as this is entirely down to ourselves."
"But the failure of human rights policies to work is something for which both Commission and Parliament must take the blame."
"That is what we wish to discuss this evening, and I cannot really endorse the comments made by Mr Dankert."
"In my view this is not just a budgetary problem."
"I would also like to broaden the context a little, as I was involved in the discussion on all of this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"You failed to make it sufficiently clear that the entire discussion over the last few days and weeks has centred on the issue of the 1998 human rights policy. You talked a little about its execution, but you were not able to tell us much about the budget for 1999."
"We have proposed a budget in which we have again had to accept some minor defects. It affects, of course, not only the human rights budget lines but also Bosnia, Kosovo, Latin America, MEDA, the Middle East and more."
"Our point though is a different one. For two years now, we have been looking to have a dialogue with the Commission on various resolutions in order to find new structures, but we did not manage to achieve this."
"This explains why the letter was written, which was actually supposed to have gone to the President of the Commission."
"But the dialogue did not take place."
"Together with yourself at first, we tried to invite the President, Commissioner Liikanen, and even the Secretary-General."
"But these visits never took place, which accounts for part of our annoyance."
"Even the instruments created hitherto have not worked as we had actually imagined they would. People have been saying that for a year now."
"We are constantly told that the programmes require greater transparency, and Mr Liikanen said this again this morning."
"Of course this also applies to the democracy programmes."
"But when we hear (and you have not entirely denied this) that the macro-projects just go to large organisations - the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and so on - then our view is that there should be interinstitutional agreements to clarify the role played by the European Union and the European Parliament with their resources."
"The second point is that we really cannot be glad about your shifting the micro-projects to EU delegations, without central monitoring from Brussels to include the NGOs. We cannot be glad about your shutting out the agency that previously helped you, no matter what the reasons behind it and regardless of your explanations."
"They are clients that help us to spread the European Union ideas of human rights and democracy far and wide. Most importantly of course, six months before an election they could really stab us in the back if we were to reclaim one of the most humane features of the European Union in a reorganisation."
"I admit that all this is very difficult but perhaps we should discuss it together at some point."
"When I consider that the result might be something like the course for the Masters degree in Human Rights, and that at one of its summit meetings the Council might set up a European Human Rights Monitoring Agency, a body which we really do not want as it would make it impossible for us to see where resources are going, then my urgent recommendation is that we meet here once again to have a better dialogue."
"Madam President, Commissioner, you have already answered a number of questions which I shall nevertheless put to you again directly."
"The Liberal Group is asking for a clear statement on how human rights policy is being implemented, either from you or from the Commission."
"It would seem, Commissioner, that fine words are obscuring a far harsher reality - the reality of inability, impotence and perhaps bureaucracy."
"How can it be that the Commission supposedly has hardly any officials to implement more than 1 000 projects, and how can we reconcile what you have said with the fact that 200 projects have not been implemented?"
"Why has the Commission not drawn on the technical assistance which the European Human Rights Foundation could provide?"
"From reports reaching us in recent months, it has become clear that chaos and poor monitoring of projects continue to be the order of the day, with no adequate measures being taken in the wake of what I have to say are administrative irregularities."
"We are talking about human rights, about people, and we are talking about people not on the other side of the world, but on the other side of society."
"I do not think the Commission has any right at all to gamble with their fate."
"Not that it means to, but that is what is happening."
"I would also like the Commission to tell us why money is being spent via the 'big' funds, the Council of Europe and the United Nations."
"I do not think we have drawn up our budget just to see development funds channelled into small projects through the Council of Europe."
"The process of constant reorganisation within the Commission is damaging the Union's human rights policy and has damaged it in the past."
"The Commission has not yet altogether thrown away the Union's good name on human rights but it is putting it in jeopardy, and we owe that good name to the work the Commission has done in the past."
"The priority for the Liberal Group is microprojects so that as wide a public as possible can be reached, and it is also essential of course that the funds should be soundly managed."
"I wish you a great deal of luck and staying power, Commissioner."
"Madam President, Mrs van Bladel cannot be here because of a meeting on human rights, and she has asked me at all events to be here before the actual reports on legal matters come up for discussion."
"But I have her authority to say just one thing, and that is in response to what Commissioner van den Broek said a moment ago."
"I refer to the tension which exists between our inclination to favour small-scale projects, because these have a more direct influence on human rights in countries where this is needed, and the scrutiny exercised by the Commission."
"A new case has just arisen in the Netherlands - I will not say which it is, you will be getting a question from me on the matter raised in the NRC on the misuse of funds in South Africa and so on, and I shall not go into it now - but it is most important, and here I totally agree with Mr Bertens, that you really do have the necessary know-how and powers of scrutiny to ensure that small projects are monitored properly."
"I wish you every success, and I thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, Commissioner, with the coming 50th anniversary of the UN Charter of Human Rights, I think it is quite shameful for this House to be engaged this month in a discussion on what is so bad about the management of DGIA."
"As you began your comments with the statement that rumours were circulating, I would like to point out that you are also responsible for giving rise to some of them."
"Five or six weeks ago, I wrote to you personally to tell you of my worries on this subject. To this day, unfortunately, I have received no reply."
"I am having to answer telephone calls such as the one today from a colleague in the Belgrade organisation 'Women in Black', which reached agreement with the Commission upon a project in 1997, carried it out, wrote the final report, and has been waiting for the final payment to be made since the beginning of 1998."
"This is because no one in the Commission has been able to read the final report, declare the work to be in order, and say that the organisation should receive the final payment because it has managed the project according to the rules."
"Please tell me, what should I say to these people on the telephone?"
"Should I say that there are some rumours in circulation, but that in general everything is going terrifically well in the Commission?"
"Or should I say that things are not that great?"
"We both know exactly what the truth is."
"It is out of the question for us to take this issue of mini-budgets and legal bases, and fight it out at the expense of the NGOs in this sensitive area."
"Mr van den Broek, pressure from the Committee on Budgets would make no difference at all to the mini-budgets. This has to do with the correct application of the Financial Regulation, which stipulates that money from Part A should not be used for Part B and vice versa."
"You cannot say that the Committee on Budgets is applying pressure."
"The Commission has known since 1991 that mini-budgets were not authorised and it has used them anyway."
"I very much agree with you that a solution should now be found to this particular issue."
"I was glad to hear you say therefore that in the 1999 budgetary procedure, together with the Commission and Council, we are going to find a solution for next year, and I hope for this year too, as you indicated."
"At any rate, what makes the rumours so offensive is that behind all this lurks an unspoken policy change by the Commission."
"That is why you must tell us whether you agree with Mr Burghardt, when he wrote on 22 October this year that in 1998 and 1999 priority will be given to payments to the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and so on."
"If that is the new Commission policy on human rights, then we might as well give up, and then a new debate on the true meaning of the construction of civil society and the defence of democracy and human rights both inside and outside the European Union will begin."
"Madam President, this is clearly a case of a Commission manoeuvre backfiring."
"Chapter 7 was 'invented' by Parliament and we are proud of it."
"Every year more money and more resources are requested."
"Every year, for example, I table an amendment asking for more officials for the internal management of this item, but this amendment is never adopted by the Committee on Budgets."
"The Commission has tried to argue over a system which basically worked until it was unfortunately realised that outside bodies were acting to accelerate the contracts."
"The Commission's manoeuvre has backfired and we are the first to have said that such a system cannot work."
"The lack of additional officials is clearly the Commission's fault."
"However, I believe that we too should examine our consciences to see how many of these additional items, which you have secretly removed without our approval, could have been spared if communications had been better and if our priorities had been better structured by using the essential resources provided by the admirable Part A of the budget."
"Madam President, it is clear that everyone is concerned about an apparently badly structured case and an organisation which was satisfactory in practical terms and also in terms of finance and accounting given the thanks it received from the Court of Auditors."
"So we now find ourselves in a very delicate situation where appropriations might not be committed."
"It is clear that the European Union represents the very essence of democracy in the world."
"This is because, after the horrors which our continent has experienced and in which many of our countries have unfortunately participated to a certain extent, we want to tell the world that this will never happen again."
"Rather, we want to stress that we are the home of human rights and we can therefore give others assistance."
"Yet we are deprived of the tools we need and the appropriations that are going to be used by others."
"This situation must be resolved as quickly as possible because it is clear that elsewhere in the world, as we chose to assume a global duty in this area, the poor and the disadvantaged, those who are persecuted, exiled or wrongly prosecuted, whether individuals or communities, cannot wait for us to agree on regulations."
"They cannot accept the excuse that our procedures are unsuitable and that they must therefore wait until the year 2000 for us to sort ourselves out."
"Everyone must make an effort and, even though we should respect certain rules and we should have legal bases, we must be able to act quickly."
"This has been proven by Hurricane Mitch, which has ravaged Central America and brought the international community to life."
"Why could we not do this ourselves?"
"You have made the admirable suggestion of setting up a monitoring centre, or rather an agency, together with other solutions, but the fundamental point is that we must act quickly."
"Commissioner, it would be good if you could do this."
"Commissioner, it is not clear from your comments whether the money which is to be committed this year is really going to be of benefit to the small human rights projects run by NGOs."
"I suspect that due to the shortage of personnel in the Commission, you have decided to simply hand this year's money over in large chunks to the international organisations."
"However, in my view this contradicts the budgetary purpose of these resources, which is to build up and strengthen the grass roots organisations of democracy in the beneficiary countries."
"I would be very glad if you could dispel my suspicion."
"I would also like to ask what problems you had with external support."
"And how would you assess these problems within the Commission in the light of the Court of Auditors report, which specifically praises this type of cooperation as the only way for smaller organisations to obtain access to this money at all?"
"I have to be completely honest and say that I think these questions must be answered because otherwise the European Parliament is going to have draw its own conclusions."
"Madam President, on the point about the interinstitutional agreement, I should like to ask the Commissioner by whose authority the interinstitutional agreement by which there was an advisory committee, established between Parliament, the Commission, the Council of Europe and the G24, was unilaterally abrogated on 9 January this year."
"I used to represent Parliament on that committee, and there were officials from Parliament too."
"We were told it was now ended."
"Since that time none of the programmes under democracy have gone forward."
"It is important to know that the Commission decided then to take all these matters in-house."
"Further, why, in response to a number of questions here, the contract in the tender brochure, properly entered into, which was won by the Human Rights Foundation, was never enacted."
"The result of that is that the democracy programmes, which we all support here, and the human rights programmes, are now dying."
"To take the last question first, Mr McMillan-Scott is aware that there are no longer two deadlines per year for submitting applications for aid, as was formerly the case, but that applications may now be submitted all through the year."
"Consequently there was no point in continuing the procedure whereby a review of them was conducted twice a year."
"Let me begin, Madam President, by clearing up another seemingly persistent misconception, namely that although policy in that direction has changed compared with last year, we are now focusing all our attention on the big organisations, OSCE or the Council of Europe."
"I can tell you that if we look at last year, the proportion of our spending which went to those organisations was about ten per cent."
"I should add, and I have not heard anyone make the point here tonight, that these projects are also human rights projects and civil society projects organised with the Council of Europe for the Baltic states, and in Albania too, and we all know what is going on there, and in Ukraine."
"In other words, it will not do to regard those projects as less worthy and put all our energy into small projects."
"The emphasis is still on small projects, but with all the difficulties inherent in them."
"I would ask you to understand here that it was less difficult for us to deal with these small projects while we were indeed able to count on outside help - help not only for the beneficiaries, the NGOs, but also for the Commission itself, which cannot manage and implement hundreds, sometimes thousands of contracts using its permanent staff alone."
"So for the benefit of Mrs Müller I would say yes, I do indeed recall your letter, which I believe recommended that we should conclude direct contracts with the European Human Rights Foundation."
"Mrs Müller also knows that last year we got bogged down over this tendering procedure as regards the Foundation due to the restricted interpretation given to our freedom to use outside assistance, the whole discussion about disputes, and so on. In other words, it is one thing or the other, Madam President, either we agree that the Commission cannot handle these kinds of projects, and smaller projects, without outside assistance, or we say no, you cannot have that outside assistance."
"It is up to you to decide what Parliament wants, but I have no option but to put the emphasis on larger-scale projects, which I am not doing at the moment."
"So above all let us agree on where we stand."
"Madam President, I think what we are in fact proposing now is that we make sure for the immediate future that we have an interinstitutional agreement, so that in any event a legal base is created pending adoption, formal acceptance of the new regulation."
"That, as we know, is currently being debated by the Council and Parliament, and with all the amendments which have been put down it looks as if it may take some time before this regulation is adopted."
"So we need an interinstitutional agreement in order to be able to continue the legal base."
"Secondly, and no doubt in this case equally importantly, we must at all events have a budget remark which, as I said in the first instance, will allow us to secure the outside assistance we need for 1999, possibly by the conclusion of direct contracts."
"I see no other way of restoring the good reputation we had previously established."
"And it certainly is not true that we have too few staff working on this, Mr Bertens, I too read those newspaper reports, about two hundred projects still floating around somewhere and still not yet assessed."
"That is not correct either."
"We have reached the stage where we can say for 1998 that within a few weeks' time we shall not only have assessed all the projects but also, as far as the Commission is concerned, we shall have accepted and approved them."
"But of course that still leaves us with the whole business of contracts, implementation, payment and evaluation."
"The Commission cannot do all that itself without outside assistance."
"If I am raising my voice here, it is because we feel very strongly about this."
"Human rights policy is something of huge importance to the European Commission, as it is important to the Union as a whole."
"We have very specific contacts on that with a large number of organisations which are active in this field."
"We are very much concerned, for example, with a region like Eastern Europe where the whole process of developing a civil society is naturally part of the efforts to foster an effective process of integration."
"But it is not fair to hold us solely responsible for one or two hiccups last year: the first time when the Court judgment meant that we could not create a legal base; the second time when a very restrictive interpretation was given of the freedom to use outside assistance, because of all the debate concerning disputes and the like."
"It distresses me greatly, Madam President, to be told by the Court of Auditors year after year that our aid projects, PHARE and TACIS to name but two, can never be implemented with our existing staffing levels and then to be accused in a Court of Auditors' report this year of making too much use of outside assistance, with as a result the whole debate which has now taken place in Parliament."
"It prompts me to ask, what am I supposed to do?"
"How can I in fact implement these projects if I cannot increase my staff, and I ask the question again."
"Because once these projects are completed, the question is whether or not those people are still needed."
"So some degree of flexibility has to be maintained."
"We have to try to find a solution to this, and I shall certainly play a part in assessing the ideas put forward for the longer term concerning agencies and suchlike."
"That concludes what I have to say, Madam President, and I must thank the House for its altogether constructive comments."
"I hope that in the short term, budget remarks will in any event provide a solution for next year."
"That will mean that the NGOs and those who benefit from their work do not suffer, and it will give us a little more time to consider together how best to proceed in the longer term."
"I would just say to Mrs Lenz that I suggested earlier in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, where I am a very faithful visitor, that I might come once or twice a year to exchange views with you on human rights strategy as such."
"Not management and operational matters, the place for that is a debate such as the one we have had this evening, but to trace the broad lines and hear what Parliament thinks."
"I have no problem at all with that, but first we must see to it that we get the ship under way again."
"I think that is the main priority."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Patents"
"The next item is the report (A4-0384/98) by Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Commission Green Paper on promoting innovation through patents (COM(97)0314 - C4-0342/97)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Green Paper we have before us has three main aims: to provide an overview of the protection afforded by patents, to examine the need for further Community action and to consider the form and substance of any such action."
"Commissioner, of all the methods available to protect innovation, a patent is one of the most important."
"From your point of view, however, the present system has three serious shortcomings. It is complex - national patents exist alongside Community patents -, it is costly, and it does not offer uniform protection in all the Member States."
"Taking all this into account, the Green Paper queries the extent to which the parties concerned would be prepared to make use of a system of a Community patent based on a regulation, on the basis of Article 235 of the Treaty. This arrangement would replace intergovernmental agreements such as the 1975 Luxembourg Convention or the agreement signed in 1989, which have not come into force."
"A regulation of this type would enable users to benefit from an accessible and legally secure system, at a reasonable cost."
"Further technical issues with a bearing on the future of a Community patent are raised: harmonisation, the impact of the information society and electronic commerce, to name but a few."
"Finally, the Green Paper raises the issue of the best way of modifying the system of fees within the patent system, to ensure it is appropriate for the service provided but does not deter the protection of innovation."
"The proposal for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs proposes harmonising this legislation within the European Union in order to consolidate the internal market, which is particularly important in advance of enlargement."
"The Luxembourg Convention and the 1989 Agreement do not provide unitary protection for patents within the European Union."
"Such a Community patent will have no option but to coexist with national patent systems."
"Further, we need to ensure that a Community patent can be converted into a European patent and devise a system whereby, conversely, a European patent can become a Community patent."
"The European Patent Office should be the technical operator of the patent, in cooperation with national authorities."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, a Member State must not abandon its national language since a patent is a means of providing information concerning the state of the technology and legal certainty."
"We therefore support the principle of linguistic equality, Commissioner, and would draw your attention to our recommendation for a procedure providing for such equality and a range of languages, on condition that this does not result in undue cost."
"As regards jurisdiction, national courts must be competent both in cases of infringement action and patent revocation, as is the case in the system used in trademark law."
"In our view, there should be two national courts to ensure more flexibility, greater ease and lower costs, especially for SMEs."
"The body of appeal should be the European Communities' Court of First Instance."
"We feel that the issue of employees' inventions should be settled by the Member States themselves."
"In our view, the mutual recognition of industrial property agents should also be considered."
"In conclusion, Madam President, Commissioner, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights calls on the Commissioner to establish a working group with the task of preparing one or more models for insurance to cover legal expenses in the field of patents."
"The working party should, for instance, study the way in which the scheme is funded, insurance cover, the level of premiums and a control authority."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must first congratulate the Commission and particularly Commissioner Monti, who was responsible for this Green Paper on the Community patent, together with Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the excellent work carried out on such an important issue. Clearly, this issue is significant not only as regards legal protection, but also from an economic point of view."
"The Green Paper is subtitled: 'promoting innovation through patents'."
"The number of patents granted is often one of the measures used when analysing the importance of innovation and attempting to quantify it in the various areas."
"We have evidently been found wanting at European Community level: there is not sufficient harmonisation, as no genuine European patent exists."
"Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes has already remarked that we are still operating within the framework of the 1973 Munich Convention on the European Patent, and that neither the 1975 Luxembourg Convention on the Community Patent or the 1989 Agreement have been implemented."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs has considered this matter and unanimously approved a series of recommendations. I have proposed these as amendments."
"Firstly, they aim to facilitate the introduction of the Community patent through fees at Community level."
"Secondly, they aim to facilitate the transition from the present patents at Member State level to the proposed Community patent."
"Thirdly, they aim to explore the possibility of patenting computer or software programmes as is already the case in Japan and in the United States. We have raised this issue repeatedly in many contexts, in connection with utility models or other aspects of protection and inventions."
"Madam President, spending Tuesday evening discussing patents is not everyone's idea of fun."
"Yet my group colleague, Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, was right to point out how important the subject is both for individual countries and for the Union as a whole."
"If we are to foster innovation and remain competitive, we need a system that works."
"There is also a regional policy dimension, in that citizens around the Union are entitled to a level playing field."
"I trust that a system will be devised that enables the European Patent Office to fulfil its mission, which is ultimately to spread knowledge."
"As Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes says, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has come out in favour of equal treatment of languages and advocates decent and fair service for all companies."
"I hope that the Commission will take up these proposals, and that the European patent will promote the spreading of information, benefit technology and guarantee legal certainty."
"If the committee's ideas are taken up, I am confident that this will be the case."
"It would be good if the Commission could accept the creative suggestions we put forward in recital E and paragraph 2, where we call for effective cooperation between the European Patent Office and the national authorities."
"I did mention to the Commissioner on another occasion that new technology would make a decentralised approach possible, and I hope that this option will be pursued."
"May I also express my gratitude to the rapporteur for the excellent degree of cooperation."
"I do not make a habit of saying thank you, but Mr Añoveros has done such a good job that I cannot resist."
"What is more, my Nordic soul glows at the mention of the EEA in the text of the resolution."
"All too often we forget that the directives which we adopt will, in many instances, apply in Norway and Iceland too."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the Commission for taking the initiative to produce this Green Paper."
"If we want to ensure that Europe is competitive, we have to work on innovation."
"Sponsoring research is one element of a policy supportive of innovation."
"At the same time, however, it is of crucial importance to guarantee effective legal protection of industrial property throughout the EU."
"In this context, it is also particularly important for all the options for reshaping European patent law to be explored, a process which the Commission has initiated with its Green Paper."
"A key point, to which I - speaking on behalf of the Committee on Research - attach particular importance is improving patent protection for computer software."
"Pursuant to Article 52(2) of the European Patent Convention and the corresponding national patent laws in the European Union, computer programs are excluded from patent protection."
"If we do not want to lose our competitive edge in the field of computer software technology, we need to change this legal situation."
"We should, therefore, delete computer programs from the provisions of Article 52(2) of the European Patent Convention."
"In addition, the respective national provisions should be harmonised by means of a European directive."
"By introducing these new arrangements, we could avoid falling behind the United States and Japan, where there is already extensive patent protection for computer software."
"New rules also need to be introduced on the language regime."
"The rapporteur's preferred solution here is also the one I have supported in my opinion for the Research Committee."
"A translation of the full patent specification would only be required if there were a dispute over the rights created by the patent."
"This would mean that the average translation costs could be reduced from their previous DEM 22 500 to DEM 4 000."
"Once again, my thanks go to the rapporteur."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, patent policy is a very important instrument in economic policy, and licensing policy is directly derived from patent policy."
"Research and development can thus lead to new products being created, and there was once a very good quotation on the subject: 'today's research and development policy is tomorrow's social policy'."
"A good patent policy is a particularly effective way of supporting research policy."
"We need to be aware that, on the one hand, there are the small-scale inventors who, once they have invented something, face the problem of developing the idea into a marketable commodity."
"Without a patent, it would be easy for a large company to appropriate this idea and exploit it."
"We know of many researchers, inventors working on their own, who have spent years, if not decades, working on particular ideas."
"On the other hand, many multinational companies have large research establishments which have billions pumped into them, and ultimately, of course, this investment has to pay off."
"That is why I am in favour of harmonising national provisions, because it is important, for both small and large companies, to identify the basic conditions which will make a single procedure possible."
"We know that inventiveness is important."
"If the Japanese display a very low level of invention, and we in Europe a very high one, then there will be many patents in Japan, and not in Europe, and this will affect the balance of licences accordingly."
"That is why I very much welcome the Commission proposal, precisely because international policy on patents and licences is an extremely important instrument for Europe."
"Madam President, you can deduct my time from the three minutes I had on the Ferri report."
"I am not Mrs Schaffner who was down to speak, and nor am I Mrs van Bladel."
"But on behalf of my group, I have to say that we are particularly grateful both to Mr Añoveros and to the Commissioner for this project, which is so important to Europe because in terms of the simplicity and safeguards we are seeking here, it is far more accessible than large-scale projects which encounter far more problems, and Commissioner Monti knows that."
"So I hope that the small project, which is far more important than large projects for strengthening the competitiveness of Europe's small businesses, will come into effect and be implemented quickly, and once again my warmest thanks to both gentlemen for their contribution here."
"Mr President, the patent system plays a crucial role in promoting innovation, growth and employment in the Community."
"In order to play this role to the full, the European patent system needs to be thoroughly overhauled and updated."
"It has two very obvious weaknesses, especially if compared with the systems in North America and Japan: it is costly and it is incomplete."
"As is clear from the report by Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes - whom I congratulate on the quality of his work - there is a direct link between the competitiveness of companies and the free movement of goods and services within the single market."
"A coherent and effective Community system of patent protection is a vital element in this context."
"The Commission's Green Paper has been successful in generating a very broad-based debate on this issue, in which those concerned have participated enthusiastically."
"The overall message emerging from these discussions is that the effectiveness of the patent system should be boosted by fully incorporating the practical needs of users."
"Moreover, as is rightly highlighted in the motion for a resolution under discussion today, the system must be restructured prior to the enlargement of the European Union."
"In particular, a clear and unanimous consensus has emerged that the right approach to reforming the system is the introduction of a unitary Community patent, preferably through a Community regulation, as was done in 1994 for the Community trade mark."
"I would recall here that, in late January 1998, the Commission held a meeting of experts from the Member States, an overwhelming majority of whom expressed a willingness to engage in legal and technical discussions linked to the design of the Community patent."
"The Economic and Social Committee, for its part, was virtually unanimous in adopting a highly positive opinion on the whole range of proposals aired in the Green Paper, including the introduction of the Community patent."
"I am pleased to note that the proposals put forward by Mr Añoveros go along similar lines: these proposals are extremely cogent and well-balanced, and I can assure you that they will be studied in detail by the Commission as it makes the legal preparations for introducing the Community patent."
"I would also say, with regard to the system of insurance to cover the costs of legal proceedings connected with patents, that the Commission will investigate the best ways of promoting this system across the Community and will involve the European Parliament in this task."
"To conclude, the Commission is now thoroughly convinced that the patent system must be modified as soon as possible."
"This modification must be based, on the one hand, on legislation to establish a Community right to patent protection and, on the other, on the updating and harmonisation of national rules on certain specific points, including the patentability of inventions relating to computer programmes, as mentioned by various speakers."
"In addition, this new framework could perhaps include Community action to support efforts made by national patent offices to promote innovation."
"I believe that the system must be developed within a Community context and not, as originally intended, through an international convention."
"Such an approach will inevitably strengthen the Union's hand when it comes to negotiating international agreements, and the role of the European Patent Office as technical operator of the Community patent will be guaranteed."
"The Commission will shortly be preparing a communication on the follow-up to be given to the Green Paper; this communication will conduct a thorough review of the consultations and announce the specific measures which the Commission intends to present in this important sector in the near future."
"The European Parliament will obviously be involved in this new stage of our work, but I already wish to thank Members for the constructive way in which they have participated so far."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Supplementary pensions"
"The next item is the report (A4-0400/98) by Mr Ferri, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market (COM(97)0283 - C4-0392/97-00/0595(COS))."
"Madam President, what is to become of Europe's pensioners?"
"The Commission's very well-structured Green Paper addresses this question - and it does so in a responsible fashion, as do we in the European Parliament, in these times of widespread crisis when the two most crucial and worrying issues of all are the economic future of pensioners and jobs for young people."
"Hence the need for this initiative taken by the Commission, which I should like to thank, and in particular Mr Monti himself."
"The Commission took the initiative, with active support from Parliament, of holding public hearings with the leading experts from various European countries; these, I believe, have shed light on a whole range of aspects."
"The first point to make is that we are all convinced that the first pillar - state social security - must remain the cornerstone, the foundation of the system."
"But it is not sufficient: cracks are appearing, and it cannot guarantee our economic future."
"That is why, together with life assurance which is well established and well regulated, pension funds are coming under the spotlight."
"A Community framework is however lacking: the Commission attempted to create one in 1991, but the proposal was subsequently withdrawn; there was an interpretative note from the Commission, if I remember rightly, which was then overturned by the Court of Justice; and now here we are again making a fresh attempt."
"We are calling on the Commission, given that it made such a good start, to draw up a directive taking due account of the various aspects which we have sought to highlight."
"One key point in the background is of course the sustainability of the euro, which in fact changes the frame of reference for pension funds and for supplementary pension schemes in general; in many senses, it certainly facilitates investment and cross-border mobility of workers."
"I must say here that another directive, a very recent one, has tackled at a most opportune moment the problem of acquired rights, also an important aspect of this afternoon's report."
"In addition, the report sets out to cover various general aspects: taxation, in other words fiscal harmonisation to eliminate the undoubted risk of double taxation, which at present jeopardises the future of anyone working for a multinational who is transferred or even temporarily seconded and runs the risk of being taxed twice over, including from a pension point of view."
"Another aspect is fund management, with administrative managers and investment managers: this is another very sensitive point which we have investigated jointly with workers and under their supervision, ensuring equal representation of men and women; this aspect has been stressed repeatedly here, in opinions from the Committees on Social Affairs and Women's Rights which we have taken on board."
"Then of course there are organisational aspects: a Pension Forum has been proposed, and could I believe be useful for the purposes of wider comparisons; the so-called European passport; and a stock exchange for SMEs, which will have the task of making investments that are vital and very sensitive, but at the same time very advantageous and very stimulating."
"All of this has still to be achieved, through capitalisation and the 'prudent man' principle."
"This point is an important and interesting one."
"I attended a congress on pension funds in Munich, where this concept of the 'prudent man' was discussed at length."
"I took the liberty of putting forward a framework, a sort of chart with various pointers."
"Naturally, the 'prudent man' is difficult to define, but in this most sensitive of sectors his hands must not be tied, because he must obviously manage his affairs in the light of the particular historical and economic context in which he is operating. We were nevertheless able to agree in the Legal Affairs Committee on a few little rules, which I believe are of some interest and comply with freedom of establishment, freedom to make cross-border investment, and so on and so forth."
"So, all in all, I would once again thank Mr Monti - for his sensitivity and attentiveness - and all who have participated in this work. This package - explained in more detail in the text - should constitute a significant turning-point in our economic system and also in the fundamental rights of our citizens."
"Madam President, Commissioner, first I must congratulate the Commission on the fact that thanks to the Green Paper a full picture has been provided of supplementary pensions and the whole question of pensions, and it is important that pensions should be considered at European level."
"If the demographic trend continues as it is at present, there will in future be just two employed people funding every pensioner, rather than the four we have at present."
"The reason for that is partly that most pension schemes in the European Union are funded by the pay-as-you-go system."
"So we urgently need to seek other solutions, because otherwise it may be disastrous when the euro comes in."
"I have said this on previous occasions here, and I think we must give it very serious thought."
"Apart from that, I think it is very difficult to tell Member States which system they should choose."
"But we can use benchmark studies, of the kind which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends, at least to identify the best practices in the Member States and put these before the various Member States."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs also thinks it important that pension systems should be gender-neutral, and that the investment returns on pension funds should be improved."
"That after all may lead to lower indirect wage costs, enabling more jobs to be created in Europe."
"The same goes for the pension providers' prudential rules."
"If these can be put in place quickly, I think it will mean a better investment yield on pension funds."
"These are things which will also be good for jobs in Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I think we need to look at pensions again here as a broader-based issue."
"I would urge the Commissioner to address the whole question of pensions again, including basic pensions."
"Madam President, in my opinion the essential merit of this Green Paper is that the Commission clearly specifies that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for the Member States to decide on the role of the first, second and third pillars which form the basis of pension schemes for employees and the self-employed in the Member States."
"I believe that the Community framework needed to ensure the development of a genuine single market for pension funds must be limited to removing the obstacles to the free choice of pension funds, to the free movement of persons and to the freedom to provide services."
"I must stress that the prudential supervision rules currently in force in some Member States are too disproportionate to guarantee the security of funds and they prevent fund managers from determining the best capital investment strategy."
"With regard to pension fund investment policy, the rules should prescribe the diversification of investment portfolios."
"Taxation is clearly a potential brake on the free movement of persons and on the freedom to provide services."
"I believe that tax treatment in the European Union must be harmonised, providing for tax exemption or deductibility when rights are constituted, and that beneficiaries should be taxed in accordance with Member States' income tax rules."
"Having said this, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights, I must insist on equal treatment for men and women in supplementary pension schemes."
"I know that the life expectancy of women is generally longer than that of men, but gender-based actuarial calculations cannot cause the principle of equal contributions and equal benefits for beneficiaries of both sexes to be questioned."
"I must also take this opportunity to stress the urgent need for the revision of the directives on equal treatment for men and women in statutory and occupational social security schemes so that we can lay the foundations for the individualisation of pension rights, fix flexible retirement ages for men and women, regulate the rights of survivors and those of divorced spouses during the splitting of pension rights acquired during marriage and, finally, ensure independent social security for spouses assisting self-employed partners in the craft sector, trade, agriculture and the professions."
"Mr Monti, I hope that you will inform your colleague, Commissioner Flynn, of these requests."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for producing this report because it is a very important one."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for bringing forward the documentation, although I may have a few critical comments to make as I go on."
"One of the most enriching experiences I have had in the European Parliament is a look at the structures which have governed Europe economically since 1945."
"That has led to huge economic benefits for the people of mainland Europe."
"The codecision and the codetermination policy which meant that communities, workers and people involved in the businesses worked together to build up Europe after 1945 was not repeated in the United Kingdom."
"In the United Kingdom we adopted the Anglo-American type structure."
"In the 1950s we saw the growth of pension and insurance funds in the UK."
"The figure now stands at something like £1.3 trillion, which converts into something like ECU 1.6 trillion, a huge amount of money by any standards."
"And yet we have watched since 1979, when Mrs Thatcher removed exchange controls in the United Kingdom, an investment drain and a portfolio investment drain from the United Kingdom to other parts of the world: from 6 % to 31 % out of the EEC, which the Commission now admits is the actual figure."
"There is no effective control on these funds by the contributors."
"They are set to one side as fund managers make use of the huge financial weapon afforded to them in takeovers, mergers and increases in the wages of the fat cats in the City of London."
"In any casual glance at the National Association of Pension Funds in my country you would have to search long and hard to find a workers' representative, and yet there are many representatives from the City of London."
"Compare this with Holland, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the other countries where cooperation, codecision and consultation are the order of the day."
"Yet the Commission, in its White Paper, made no reference whatsoever to the possible involvement of the contributors."
"I hope and trust that when the Commission brings forward the directive which I understand it is considering, there will be a clear assurance that the contributors towards these huge funds will be involved."
"The Socialist Group will support the European market model of codecision and codetermination."
"We reject short-termism and we expect financial and economic returns for our citizens."
"For a number of years now I have studied the advancement of political democracy."
"One of the people that I looked to for inspiration was Tom Paine, who took part in two revolutions, one in America and one in France, and strove for political democracy."
"I believe it is time now for us to move forward in order to give the citizens of Europe an economic democracy."
"I believe, with the Socialists, that democracy is best served by the European social market model."
"Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has incorporated the principal amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in its report, and has thus made appropriate comments on the Green Paper."
"Five points need to be emphasised, which the Commission should respect when drafting further Community legislation on the basis of the Green Paper."
"Firstly: reforms to the scope and structure of the first pillar - that is, statutory pension schemes on the pay-as-you-go model - can only take place at national level, and must thus remain the responsibility of national bodies."
"In my opinion, the Community is not competent to deal with contracts between the generations formed at national level."
"Secondly: supplementary pension schemes in the internal market are also characterised by a multitude of schemes and pension funds."
"Community legislation should not discriminate against pension funds, either in terms of prudential supervision provisions or in terms of tax conditions."
"Thirdly: restrictions on investment can only be eased if standard prudential supervision rules guarantee the possibility of controls, the joint involvement - on an equal footing - of those entitled to pensions, and insolvency insurance."
"Fourthly: basic tax conditions for supplementary pension schemes need to be harmonised and improved across the internal market, so as to better exploit the potential of the internal market in pension schemes and to make it more competitive."
"The principle of downstream taxation of pension entitlements should apply throughout the Community."
"Fifthly: a high degree of convergence needs to be achieved within the Community on transferring and preserving pension entitlements and on vesting periods."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, but also the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, for endorsing the proposals made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to modify the Green Paper."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the future, and the future is very important for everyone."
"Babies born today will probably live to be 100 years old!"
"We know that one of our most important objectives for the future is to remain in good health until we reach old age."
"That means that, even today, we need to consider how we can maintain the level of social security for the elderly."
"Today we have the principle of the contract between generations, with the result that young people provide what the elderly consume, and we need to complement this, in an appropriate way, with the principle of saving."
"It is a question of finding a sensible way to bring public pension schemes into line with private and company ones."
"If we can produce basic conditions for an internal pensions market in Europe, then we too will be able to look towards the future with hope."
"Madam President, I had not realised I would be getting one minute more, but I shall use it primarily to raise the question of freedom of movement for workers."
"At present fewer than two per cent of all workers in Europe are employed in another Member State."
"The main reason for that is social security, and pensions too play a major part."
"I think we might find the answer to this by exploring further the possibility of a European pension passport, for example."
"The directive we have at present is a step in the right direction, but if we are looking at greater flexibility in the labour market, we could have a far more work-friendly system of pensions simply by legislating to allow people to take their pension or their pension provider with them when they change jobs or move to a different country."
"I think it is possible to enact legislation at European level to safeguard the value of pensions and beneficiaries' entitlements."
"Pension funds of the kind operating in my country, for example, are rather too reluctant in this respect."
"I would ask the Commissioner to take this a little further."
"Madam President, pension schemes are based on three pillars."
"Firstly basic schemes, government ones - in our country the AOW or Working Incapacity Act, then supplementary pension schemes, social partners with full worker codetermination, and the third pillar, voluntary supplementary pension schemes."
"I wish Commissioner Monti luck in this mission, which is a 'mission practically impossible'."
"I must stress that there has been great alarm in the Netherlands at some things which the Italian Prime Minister has said."
"Other speakers and Mr Ferri too have already made the point that if there is any meddling with the fixed value of the euro - and rightly or wrongly we in the Netherlands have understood what Commissioner Monti and Mr Ferri have said to mean that the fixed value of the euro might be tinkered with for political reasons - that would meet with fierce opposition from those on fixed pensions."
"I would urge Commissioner Monti to allay the fears which have arisen in the Netherlands and to reassure those concerned about his inherently excellent Green Paper."
"My thanks to the rapporteur for the first-class job he has done."
"Madam President, the Commission's Green Paper uses the pretexts of the ageing population and the fall in the number of workers to open the door to pensions funds for supplementary pensions."
"This is wrong as this approach totally eliminates any dynamic for a process of job creation and reduction in retirement ages."
"Even before the consultations on the Green Paper had finished, Commissioner Monti approved a Community directive aimed at defining a liberal system for pension funds in the European Union."
"This directive guarantees, for pension funds, the freedom of investment and the freedom to provide management services."
"This approach runs the risk of creating a system based on private insurance which would gradually replace social security."
"Health and retirement would no longer be rights but would become goods subject to the laws of the market."
"The basic aim of the pension fund strategy is to channel savings towards the financial markets."
"The French MEPs in my group are totally against pension funds."
"This system of capitalisation is particularly dangerous and deeply unfair as it benefits the rich, who have the ability to save, and leaves the poorest with a starvation pension."
"This is why we cannot accept the Ferri report prepared by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, given that this report conforms to the approach taken in the Commission's proposals."
"Rather, we must defend the pay-as-you-go system which is alone in guaranteeing the rights of employees and which allows the latter to claim a pension in a context of national solidarity between workers and pensioners, between generations and between the nation and its workers."
"In order to find new resources and to increase the purchasing power of pensions which often lag behind the cost of living, as evidenced by the recent demonstrations by pensioners in France, we propose to apply a levy on financial products at the same rate as that applied to wages."
"Mr President, the Green Paper on supplementary pensions in the single market had two main aims: firstly, to launch the widest possible debate on ways of ensuring the financial sustainability of pension schemes in the Member States."
"Lengthening life expectancy and falling birth rates are likely to pose a threat to schemes based solely on the pay-as-you-go model."
"Most of these schemes were established at a time when there were four or five workers for every pensioner."
"In 2015 this ratio will be in the order of two to one, or even more unfavourable in certain Member States."
"The Member States must face up to these changes and organise their pension schemes in such a way as to safeguard the income levels of elderly persons, whilst keeping public spending under control."
"As regards the second aim of the Green Paper, we must strive at EU level to ensure that supplementary pension schemes, based on capitalisation, can benefit fully from the advantages of the single market."
"The current situation is quite different: it has to be said that in many cases, pension funds face severe restrictions in respect of investments."
"As the Green Paper points out, some of these restrictions - some, not all - are not justified by prudential considerations and limit the return on funds, causing pension costs to rise."
"These restrictions are hampering the integration of capital markets in the Union, to the detriment of growth and employment."
"Pension funds are not free to use any authorised manager established in the Union, and this limits the advantages deriving from healthy and effective competition at EU level."
"Occupational mobility is hampered by the frequent absence of mutual recognition of taxation systems and of transferability of supplementary pension rights."
"Finally, and in particular, because of the lack of coordination of taxation systems, life insurance companies and pension funds are not free to offer their services throughout the Union."
"This situation is all the more unsatisfactory, considering the way that supplementary pension schemes are flourishing in the EU."
"Pension fund assets in the Member States already constitute 25 % of EU GDP, and a growing number of countries are relying on these bodies to tackle demographic and budgetary changes."
"In addition, more and more people now wish to work in different EU Member States, and they must enjoy the freedom to do so without running the risk of losing their supplementary pension rights."
"The Commission has received almost a hundred responses to the Green Paper, from the Member States, the Economic and Social Committee, and financial and social circles."
"A large majority of them stress how urgent it is to create a Community legal framework for supplementary pension schemes, which will allow them to develop throughout the single market."
"In this way they will contribute fully to consolidating social protection and safeguarding pensioners' incomes, taking account of the need for equal treatment of women and men - I am addressing Mrs Lulling in particular here; it is indeed vital that women should not be penalised."
"I am very pleased to note that Mr Ferri's excellent report likewise concludes that it is necessary as a matter of urgency to create a Community legal framework governing supplementary pension schemes, and asks the Commission to propose a directive on pension fund management and better coordination of taxation systems."
"This same conclusion was reached in the context of the action plan on financial services, proposed by the Commission on 28 October."
"The Commission is quite determined to act along these lines, and will need active support from Parliament."
"Broadly speaking, the Commission very much welcomes Mr Ferri's report and the ideas contained in the opinions from the other parliamentary committees."
"Their work has added considerably to the consultations launched by the Green Paper, and will be extremely useful in our future work."
"At the beginning of next year the Commission is to publish a communication drawing political conclusions from these consultations."
"Thereafter we intend to propose a directive to ensure that pension funds can benefit, under conditions of optimal security, from the freedom of investment and to provide services, which are laid down in the Treaty."
"Finally, the Commission will cooperate closely with the Member States in an attempt to abolish the main fiscal barriers to the creation of an internal market in supplementary pensions."
"Allow me to conclude with a comment on the remark made by Mr Janssen van Raay."
"There is no doubt that supplementary pension funds are a vital instrument in looking after future generations in Europe, not least to guarantee a sustainable financial equilibrium in the long term."
"Turning now to Mrs Elmalan, I would say that the Member States will clearly retain every right to determine what role the different pillars of pension schemes ought to have."
"It is true that the Commission's proposed approach to the role of supplementary pension systems is a substantial liberalisation of their assets and management, subject to specific prudential rules."
"If we are keen to boost employment in Europe, as Mrs Elmalan undoubtedly is, we are duty-bound to acknowledge that a single market for pension funds will - for the same level of risk - make it possible to obtain a higher yield on pension fund assets, and hence to reduce both social contributions - for the same pension entitlement - and non-wage labour costs."
"All of this naturally plays an important role in employment policy."
"I therefore believe that few issues are as central to Europe's economic and social system as this one is in several respects, and I thank Parliament once again for its most valuable contribution."
"Mr President, just briefly, when Mr Monti spoke about his Green Paper there was no mention of how the contributors to these funds, i.e. people who put their money in, are to be involved in the decision-making process."
"Could he give us some assurance that any of these communications or directives will include that which is enshrined, i.e. the European market conditions of co-determination and co-decision?"
"Mr President, I wish to respond briefly to Mr Falconer by indicating that the possible involvement of contributors in the management of supplementary pension schemes and pension funds is, of course, important and falls within the competence of the Member States rather than within the competence of the Community."
"I also wish to point out the distinction between a firm producing goods and services in which, at least in some Member States, there are forms of involvement of workers employed in it and a financial intermediary in a broad sense, like a supplementary pension scheme."
"It is not the norm in financial intermediaries to have involvement of the counterparts in the management."
"To me the best guarantee for contributors is that an appropriate prudential regulation is set out and implemented in practice."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Vehicles with more than 8 seats"
"The next item is the second report (A4-0424/98) by Mr Murphy, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC (COM(97)0276 - C4-0545/97-97/0176(COD))."
"Mr President, given the reputation, at least in Britain, of buses being late and given the fact that this particular report is coming back to us a second time, having been delayed since April of this year, it is probably apt that we are starting a little bit late on the debate this evening."
"That said, I would like to place on record my thanks to the staff of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of this House, in particular the interpreters and translators who have quite a task in dealing with this particular report."
"They have done an admirable job."
"I would also like to thank my fellow members of the Economic Committee, in particular Mr Rübig who is here with us this evening, for their assistance in getting us to this stage."
"A friend of mine told me about somebody she met at a bus-stop in my home town of Wolverhampton, a young mother with a child in a buggy."
"A bus pulled up for her but she did not get on, she let it go."
"My friend asked her why she did she not get on the bus."
"She said she could not get on to that particular bus but there would be a low-floor bus along in a little while."
"At one level that describes what we are trying to do this evening: to make sure people can get on and off buses."
"But at another level we are quite clearly trying to put in place a further important piece of the completion of the single market."
"Buses and coaches are important products of the automotive industry and we need to have certain acceptable standards so that they can freely move around the single market place."
"I hope that the Commission will accept that although the proposal we have come forward with is a radical one it is nevertheless workable."
"I recall being here having a short exchange with Commissioner Bangemann in April, about the derogations in the Commission's original proposal about taking certain vehicles outside the scope of the directive."
"He challenged me as to why that should be the case."
"I told him that my proposals would have removed those derogations because to all intents and purposes Members of this House accept that most vehicles are safe and ought to be granted type-approval, not just in their national markets, but also in the European market."
"We have come back to that proposal in this report."
"A key area, certainly for this side of the House, is accessibility and the provisions for accessibility."
"To achieve that the Economic Committee has put in certain definitions of what a passenger is."
"We have also put in certain technical standards which we would expect a technical working party to look at as mandatory, for example: the height of the first step, particular specifications for boarding aids, wheelchair accessibility on vehicles and the safety of passengers inside the vehicles."
"Allied to that, the committee has also protected the ability of national preferences and regional variations to continue, whilst at the same time accepting that certain standards of accessibility are required."
"A further area that the committee has taken on board is the whole issue of driver safety."
"If we are to have safe vehicles for the citizens of the European Union to use then we need to make sure that the drivers are comfortable and free from any risk."
"Therefore we are calling on the Commission to come forward with a proposal six months after the introduction of the directive looking specifically at driver safety."
"I accept that the report which the Economic Committee is putting before you this evening is something of a challenge to the Commission and something of a new approach."
"Nevertheless I believe it merits serious consideration by the Commission."
"I would challenge the Commission to accept what the Economic Committee is trying to do: to balance out the needs of the citizen; to balance out our obligation to complete the single market, but at the same time to bring forward a report which is useable and sensible and deals with what is needed and not perhaps what civil servants might want to see."
"I accept it as a radical challenge, something which the Commission may not have dealt with before, but I believe that if the Commission is willing to take this new approach on board then we will get closer to completing that single market, we will respect national and regional variations where buses and coaches are concerned, and the sort of story I started off with this evening, of a young mother not being able to get on a vehicle in my home town may never happen again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Murphy's very good report is much more far-reaching that the title of the dossier suggests."
"This is no longer just about vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats."
"In presenting these amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, we are signalling the beginning of a new era in technical legislation."
"Until now, proposals have been settled down to the last detail."
"I should simply like to show you the proposals here, so that you can see what huge proportions the technical legislation - just for buses with more than eight seats - has assumed."
"The legislator then has to decide whether the height of the step for boarding a bus should be 240, 260 or 280 mm."
"This, however, can and should no longer be the task of this House and its Members."
"We are more responsible for laying down the political guidelines and basic principles."
"A bus has to be safe, stable and accessible to people with reduced mobility."
"Any more detailed provisions must be agreed - on the basis of these principles - by those whom they actually affect: manufacturers, operators and users, especially elderly and disabled people."
"In this regard, I should particularly like to thank Mr Murphy for placing special emphasis on this aspect."
"That is why we are proposing that a permanent working party be set up to perform these tasks."
"It should firstly, for practical reasons, rely heavily on the regulations which already exist in the context of the UN Economic Commission for Europe."
"Secondly, European standardisation bodies will be involved, and they have accumulated a wealth of experience with this type of legislation."
"Until agreement is reached on the individual issues, however, an alternative way of guaranteeing the free movement of goods and the proper functioning of the internal market will have to be found."
"That is why the subsidiary principle of mutual recognition applies."
"Once a bus is authorised for use in one Member State, it can be authorised for use throughout Europe."
"That also ensures that the arrangements are sufficiently flexible and geared towards customers."
"The demands placed on a bus in Sicily are completely different from those placed on a bus in the north of Finland, or in a large city such as London, or in a small town such as Oberplattling in Bavaria."
"I believe that we need to give the market this freedom, so that customers can say what they want, and so that manufacturers - once they have learnt this - can offer what their customers wish to have."
"In my opinion, it signals a breakthrough in terms of the kind of legislation we should be adopting and how we should see the EU's regulatory remit. Evidence has now been produced of Parliament's faith in the market and those who operate within it."
"I refused to take part in the first round of voting in committee last spring."
"The all-embracing proposal for a directive contained mathematical formulae and levels of detail that I could not understand myself, let alone explain to my electorate."
"The committee was confronted, in addition, with 135 amendments."
"The PPE Group abstained at the first vote in plenary and managed to get the report referred back to committee."
"We owe special thanks to Mr von Wogau, who is a political stalwart, always ready to take on ambitious reports and opinions."
"He, with our support, rightly questioned the wisdom of such extensive and detailed proposals. It was high time that this happened."
"I should also like to thank Mr Murphy for his insight and understanding. As the person responsible within Parliament for the SLIM project, he presumably realises that we need to do more than simply talk."
"Through our actions, we have to demonstrate our wish to simplify regulatory activity and produce better, and less all-embracing solutions. My thanks also go to Mr Rübig, who not only asked questions, but played a constructive role in this whole discussion."
"Let us hope that industry - which frequently calls for less, but better regulation - does not feel put out by the radical nature of the changes we have made."
"There are those who would probably have benefited from a very detailed proposal - the sort of people who take one view in general discussions and another when it comes to action which affects them in particular."
"I look forward to seeing the Commission overcome its annoyance at Parliament's pruning of its painstakingly drafted proposal. There is much to be learnt from the Murphy report."
"The European Parliament has now thrown down the gauntlet to the Council and Commission. It is now up to them to demonstrate who can best meet the challenge of simplifying and improving EU procedures - fighting for a common framework, whilst trusting in the subsidiarity principle and letting the market have its say in working out standards and resolving details."
"Parliament has put down a marker this week, making it clear that we want a less detailed, but better functioning EU."
"We are acting on a mandate from the citizens of Europe, at a time when they are rightly questioning an institutional set-up which has in many ways become unwieldy, obsessed with regulations and bureaucracy."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Aerospace industry"
"The next item is the report (A4-0362/98) by Mr Hoppenstedt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission communication on the European aerospace industry: meeting the global challenge (COM(97)0466 - C4-0547/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a few years now the Union has been devoting considerable attention to European aerospace policy, as can easily be seen from numerous communications issued by the Commission."
"The present report, however, does not merely deal with one of the many aspects of this strategic domain, but also analyses the current situation in its entirety, and on that basis devises a coherent European policy for the future."
"The importance of the European aerospace industry as one of the paramount factors in our economic future is now generally accepted in Europe."
"But this economic potential can only be used to the full if the present fragmented European aerospace industry is restructured to strengthen its competitiveness in the world market, a necessity arising from the increasingly complex nature of the aerospace products that are now in demand."
"This becomes all the more important if we consider the significance of the aerospace industry as a source of employment which provided more than 377 000 direct jobs in 1997."
"The fact that the European aerospace industry has been affected in recent years by stiffer competition, cuts in public funding and the meteoric pace of technological development does not make the restructuring process any easier."
"Alarm bells started ringing in earnest within the European industry last July with the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas."
"This American example of restructuring clearly shows the direction in which the European aerospace industry should also be heading."
"Within only five years, three gigantic groups have emerged in the United States through mergers and takeovers."
"In an almost faultless blend of technological and economic potential, these groups have brought all areas of military and civilian aerospace activity as well as defence technology under one roof."
"This enables them to spread their risks as widely as possible, to strengthen their immunity to cyclical fluctuations and to ensure that, in both technological and business terms, the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts."
"But even though, with a patchwork of policies based on national interests, the European aerospace industry has undoubtedly had a very different starting position to that of the United States, for example, a great number of encouraging developments have taken place on a European scale, especially over the past year."
"One example is the project for a European Aerospace and Defence Company, which is surely incontrovertible evidence of a desire for restructuring within both the industry and national governments."
"Following a number of meetings, Daimler Benz Aerospace, Aérospatiale, Casa and British Aerospace have devised a clear plan of approach, setting out the aims, scope and operational structure of a common aerospace policy covering both the civilian and military branches of aerospace activity."
"The first step in this direction will be the creation next year of the Airbus single corporate entity."
"Although this is a great advance, it is not the only one."
"For instance, 1998 promises to be a record-breaking year for the Airbus in the large-capacity aircraft market."
"In the first half of 1998, the Airbus consortium, with a market share approaching 50 %, secured more contracts than its direct competitor, Boeing - McDonnell Douglas, for the first time."
"Civil aviation is certainly the most important branch of the aerospace industry in financial terms, but a long-term European strategy must also be established in the other branches."
"For that reason, we must welcome and develop communications-satellite projects such as Sky Bridge, the European answer to Teledesic, and the success of the Ariane programme in the domain of carrier services; the programmes for the construction of navigation satellites and the creation of satellite navigation systems are taking us in the right direction."
"In this context, it is also gratifying to note that provision has been made for this type of venture in the fifth EU framework programme of research under the broad line of action 'promoting competitive and sustainable growth' and particularly the specific programmes under the heading of 'prospects for aviation'."
"The framework programme also ensures the provision of a specific coordinating mechanism for activities within the various thematic programmes in the field of aerospace technology."
"The appraisal contained in the report spells out that Europe can only benefit in future from an unswerving commitment to progress."
"The developments and examples that have been described illustrate the fact that Europe possesses great inherent potential."
"But if that potential is to be fulfilled, the aerospace industry, with the support of the national governments and European institutions, must take up the gauntlet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations I should like to say how much I welcome the Hoppenstedt report."
"I would just refer to two salient points: cooperation and dialogue between Europe and newly industrialised countries such as China; and the Commission's involvement in international negotiations on safety and on the allocation of the resources of space and the electro-magnetic spectrum."
"From a somewhat broader point of view, I would say that the aerospace industry has emerged from the morass of a year or so ago, thanks to a number of agreements, but that so far it has only been partially restructured."
"In institutional terms and in respect of ownership arrangements, the guidelines for privatisation in France have recently been drawn up, but much still remains to be done."
"Mr Hoppenstedt has referred to the need for Airbus to have the status of European company, the fact that there is still no European Armaments Agency, and that the national space agencies are seeking a new role, whereas the ESA does not yet have a clear relationship with or clear mandate from the European Union and the Commission."
"Two things do give me cause for satisfaction: the allocation to the aerospace sector in the fifth framework programme, which is almost double that of the fourth, and the growing consensus apparent in both political and industrial circles in Europe concerning the satellite navigation programme."
"These, in my opinion, are the two positive signs within the Union; otherwise, I fear that the European aerospace industry is not moving at a sufficiently fast pace for it to meet successfully a worldwide challenge which could be crucial in our progress towards the information society."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Silguy, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hoppenstedt, everyone knows that the European aerospace industry is a prestigious jewel in the crown of our European economy, of our economic power and therefore of our political power."
"Like the rapporteur, I must firstly welcome the Franco-German-UK declaration of 9 December 1997 on this subject."
"I firmly approve, as does Mr Hoppenstedt, of the European-level restructuring of our military and civil aerospace industry."
"This is a necessity which cannot now be denied."
"Europe needs powerful integrated industrial groupings in this area, as in many other industrial sectors."
"I must at this point question the lack of desire to carry out this restructuring and to create these groupings at the right time in other European industrial sectors."
"This applies, for example, to the shipbuilding industry and even the textile industry to a certain extent."
"As someone who has observed these industrial matters for some years, I must be allowed to say this and to express my regret concerning this on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of employees in these sectors, many of whom are now unemployed."
"The reason I am saying this is because there are many other sectors which are or will be affected."
"This is now clear and we cannot pretend or say otherwise."
"I must also take this opportunity to restate that Europe must stop imposing rules, constraints and limitations, in the name of triumphant liberalism, with which our international competitors do not have to contend, which means that they are at an advantage in terms of international competition."
"Returning to aeronautics, like Mr Hoppenstedt, and all credit to him, I also approve the transformation of Airbus Industrie to give it more muscle."
"I, too, regret our weaknesses and I hope that we will find solutions in the area of communications and navigation satellites."
"The two final points which I must stress are the need to jointly develop the next generation of military equipment and airframes and never to forget in Europe the importance in social terms, and in terms of direct and indirect jobs, of the civil and military aeronautical industry and therefore obviously the need to introduce Euroworks councils as quickly as possible."
"This is a good report whose subject gives just cause for European pride and is also, in my opinion, a lesson and an example for other European industrial sectors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by thanking my honourable friend Mr Hoppenstedt for his excellent report."
"He is an acknowledged expert in this area, and I believe we must recognise that."
"We have an enormous diversity of issues to deal with, and to have someone who can deal with a subject in such depth is of extra special importance."
"Let us now turn to the substance of Mr Hoppenstedt's report."
"I believe that, while we must create the conditions for the development of a European aerospace industry, it is even more important that companies within the aerospace industry in Europe should get together properly, and there is still much to be done in this respect."
"Above all, I believe that a European aerospace company comprising several enterprises which have hitherto operated in a national framework will not tolerate government involvement in the longer term."
"I believe we shall have to organise this industry entirely within the private sector, and that remark is especially addressed to one particular country."
"Secondly, as far as defence technology is concerned, or Wehrtechnik , as we would say in German, there is an urgent need for us to cooperate so that we do not fall behind our competitors."
"In this domain, of course, some very delicate questions remain unanswered, and we have to recognise that whatever is developed must be distributed in accordance with the Member States' respective market shares, irrespective of where the product has been developed."
"But allow me to say at the same time that, whatever we do as a joint European aerospace enterprise, although we must make our own products in order to hold our own against American competition, there is no reason why we should not cooperate with the United States too in certain segments of the market, since some of the companies that will combine to form a European aerospace and defence group will naturally have their own links with the United States and with businesses there."
"So the message is: establish a strong position, but cooperate with American corporations too."
"Let me end with a word on the satellite navigation systems."
"And please listen especially carefully, Commissioner, to what I have to say on this point."
"I am not sure whether we in this House, you in the Commission and the governments in the Member States are fully aware of the problems associated with the global satellite navigation system."
"Do we really want to become dependent on the United States by jointly developing with the Americans a system that they can switch off at their own discretion?"
"We shall have to think harder about ways in which we can assert our own European identity, for this question of global satellite navigation is not only important in terms of aerospace; it is an important factor in transport policy in general, and I believe that this is a point on which we Europeans must close ranks."
"Mr President, the aerospace industry involves 350 000 people, one million jobs and a turnover of EUR 50 billion."
"It is threatened, however, by the United States, which benefits from considerable aid for technological development and has been able to anticipate the consequences of international competition."
"In this context, the Hoppenstedt report has come at an opportune moment."
"As Europe must act quickly and appropriately in order to maintain its place in the aerospace industry, our four main objectives must be: to consolidate the initial success of the launch of Ariane V; to develop a subsonic long-haul Airbus A3XX; to achieve the space and terrestrial components of the European satellite navigation systems GNS 1 and 2, and finally, in terms of research and development, to develop cheaper, lighter and more powerful satellites to meet the needs of telecommunications and Earth observation and also prevention, particularly of natural disasters."
"The competition from the US must be met by a resurgence in Europe."
"Manufacturers must now increasingly come together."
"Only in this way will the European Union score new successes in the aerospace industry and reap the benefit of its skills through the development of new activities."
"Technological developments in the aerospace industry represent aid for employment."
"We must therefore pay particular attention to developing this sector."
"Mr President, this report conforms to the Commission's approach by supporting the current restructuring in the European aeronautical industry."
"I will confine myself to this subject."
"Although Airbus has achieved enormous worldwide success, the current upheavals appear to be fraught with danger."
"The stated desire to confront Boeing and its might forms the basic argument justifying the aim of and the need for a major European aerospace grouping."
"I agree that Airbus should be given more muscle but we must realise that a ferocious battle has begun between the former associates of Airbus, who are now partners, concerning the leadership of the future grouping."
"This is despite an interim report having been sent a short while ago to the government."
"Although we need to enter a new stage in the European aerospace industry, we should pay attention to the aim and objectives of the current restructuring."
"The realisation that the purpose of this restructuring is competition and improved profitability raises concern about the future of an industry which needs long-term investment without any immediate return and whose effectiveness is particularly dependent on the skills and training of its employees, and on the recognition of their qualifications."
"This is also an industry which has always benefited in France from government subsidy, to the dislike of some people."
"I must stress that the explosion in worldwide requirements in the civil aerospace sector poses challenges of a new magnitude in terms of reducing environmental pollution and in terms of financing costs and democracy."
"My opinion is that the reasons behind the economic war in which we are engaging cannot meet these challenges."
"Mr President, it seems grotesque that we should have a report before us which purports to be about competitiveness but is actually about an increasingly highly subsidised industry."
"Fifty per cent of the aerospace industry is about military production, which is kept alive by public money and public money alone."
"The report speaks of efficiency."
"Let me tell you that the best way of achieving efficiency and competitiveness would be to combine the restructuring of the aerospace industry with disarmament strategy and not, as is suggested here, to pursue a process of building up and renewing our military arsenals."
"The Greens are particularly concerned that, in the absence of safeguards, mergers in the aerospace industry will trigger an irreversible arms spiral in Europe and that this will all happen without transparency and democratic control."
"Research and development funds are being misused here."
"In view of the changing climate, they would be far better spent on areas such as renewable sources of energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in thanking Mr Hoppenstedt for his report, I must repeat what previous speakers have pointed out, that the restructuring of the European aerospace industry is essential."
"The Member States and manufacturers are clearly aware of this and they are currently making progress towards a joint solution which will soon be satisfactory to all the partners."
"Parliament must assist this approach by ensuring that social progress is achieved, particularly in terms of Euroworks councils, as has just been mentioned."
"The aerospace industry is clearly a sector of considerable strategic importance both because of the guarantees which it can give for the defence of Europe and because of the developments it allows in the use of inner and outer space at world level over the next 50 years."
"This is why the current restructuring must not be assessed using purely liberal or capitalist criteria."
"The importance of the trade agreements resulting from this type of industry will clearly have an effect on the standard of living of people in Europe."
"The Community's financial support for research in this sector must therefore not be reduced but should actually continue in parallel with the considerable effort being made by the government of the United States in respect of the restructuring of the American aerospace sector."
"As suggested by Mr Hoppenstedt, this support must act as an incentive but under no circumstances must the aid from national and European public funds be decreased as this would dramatically reduce the scope of the restructuring undertaken."
"One point of particular concern is the development of the A3XX."
"Despite the enormous costs, large long-haul passenger aircraft are clear proof of the know-how of the aerospace industry and constitute a powerful promotional tool for a whole family of products, as the 747 has proven for Boeing over the last 20 years."
"It is therefore impossible to abstain from this project."
"I must stress the confidence which we have in the capacity of all the manufacturers and particularly the workers, managers and design offices of Aérospatiale in Toulouse to successfully complete this magnificent project."
"However, we must also take advantage of this ambitious financial programme to improve the organisation and distribution of subcontracting, so that this vital industrial effort can best serve the interests of industrial development in all the European regions concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no-one can be more delighted by the success of our aerospace industry, and in particular the exemplary cooperation represented by Airbus and Ariane, than the National Front."
"It must be emphasised once again that these initiatives owe nothing to the European institutions and everything to the willingness of the manufacturers, technical engineers and workers."
"We can only be delighted at the determination not to let our countries be subject to the domination and even in certain market segments to the monopoly of the American giant Boeing-McDonnell-Douglas."
"However, we have some concerns about the ulterior motives of the Hoppenstedt report."
"Under the guise of economic efficiency and the confused concept of integration, we are moving towards the simultaneous privatisation and Europeanisation of our defence industries."
"Under the guise of privatisation, progress is being made both towards our national defence being controlled by the Commission in Brussels by the development of Community regulations and standardisation, and towards the weakening of our military industries by every takeover bid imaginable."
"It is particularly worrying that at no time have these industrial problems been linked to the higher interest and security of the Member States, nor even of a hypothetical European superstate."
"The aim behind the integration of the civil and military sectors is not to bring into play any synergies, dual technologies or possibilities of public subsidy for research, but is merely to let the armament industry join the common fate of the European economy in terms of competition at any price and seizure of control by Brussels."
"With regard to the civil aerospace industry, the French Members must be warned against the immediate consequences of transforming the Airbus GIE into a single corporate entity."
"In the current context, this will be lead to the relocation of the headquarters in the Netherlands, followed by the relocation of the production units."
"Economies of scale and defragmentation of markets can be achieved using means other than by abandoning our companies to private capital and by Community law."
"The search for these means certainly should not involve the Commission."
"Problems of national security or strategic industries are too important to be left to the Commission."
"In France, we are not ready to forget the Commission's incredible actions concerning the shipyards."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has very clearly emphasised the significance of the European aerospace industry as a genuinely important factor in our economic future."
"I recall the parliamentary debates on other Commission communications which have repeatedly made the point that the future prospects and competitiveness of the European Union in the industrial sphere, but elsewhere too, are dependent on developments in aerospace."
"That, of course, does not absolve us from highlighting and re-examining the specific political issue that arises in connection with the civil and military components of this industry."
"The question we really ought to be asking concerns the extent to which the aerospace market is actually organised or whether such organisation is even possible - to what extent, in other words, the subsidisation of the military sector actually leads to the emergence of good competitive products for the civilian market, as is the case in other parts of the world."
"If we recall that the European Union still has but a tiny share of the world market, and if we consider that in 1996 the value of aerospace exports just edged over the ECU 15 billion mark, which is equivalent to about 3 % of all EU exports, we cannot fail to realise that aerospace is so important that the European Union, for all its successes, still needs to achieve more in this sector."
"Great challenges await the European aerospace industry."
"The merit of the Commission's communication and the Hoppenstedt report is that they really do emphasise this point, as well as indicating how fiercely the battle for supremacy is being fought in a global market, especially the market in products designed for civilian use."
"The United States is still far and away the major player in the global aerospace market - and I am telling you nothing new here - with a 58 % share."
"Moreover, the plain fact is that company structures are different in the USA."
"That is nothing new either, and for this reason the demands for an end to the fragmentation of the European aerospace industry that have been reiterated in today's debate can only be supported."
"The large number of aerospace companies in a relatively small internal market means that research, production and marketing potential is dissipated, which is not without an influence on the competitiveness of the European Union."
"Unlike the American corporations, European producers are scarcely able to cover the increasingly high development and financing risks."
"This is one of the reasons why it is important to develop new forms of business cooperation which will ensure, among other things, that economies of scale can be made and that technological and organisational synergy can be produced between the various disciplines within the aerospace industry."
"It is therefore essential to make up lost ground rather than falling further behind."
"What makes the situation especially critical is that the European aerospace industry possesses great fundamental employment potential and a highly skilled workforce."
"Aerospace is one of the top 15 industries, employing more than 370 000 people as well as sustaining thousands of jobs in component manufacturing and in other high-tech areas."
"That is why I should like to put it to the Commission that it is high time their industrial working parties and task force began to highlight the employment dimension far more clearly in the papers they produce on industrial policy, including the present one, to emphasise that employees' rights are part and parcel of the ongoing development of any industry and in particular to prescribe the principle of codetermination for key industries such as aerospace."
"Mr President, pardon my smiling, but it is pleasing to be able to conduct a political debate, even at this late hour."
"I should like to express my special thanks to Mr Hoppenstedt, who through patient determination is able to achieve progress in important areas such as the development of a global satellite navigation system, not only on this side of the Atlantic but on the other side as well."
"It is important to carry this sort of technology in our own product range, so that the market does not depend on a single supplier, because the thought that we shall be able to combine this satellite navigation system with the universal mobile telecommunications system at some time in the future opens up completely new avenues."
"That is why I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, should like to suggest to the Commission that a precise financial framework for the development of this system is long overdue, because when the time comes we shall need the proper hardware, software and mainframes."
"That will create many new jobs in Europe."
"Mr President, allow me to deal with an aspect that was not expressly mentioned in this excellent report, namely the question of component supplies."
"The aerospace industry awards contracts to hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses in most Member States of the European Union."
"If Airbus sells a large number of aircraft, that means good business for many upstream companies, which safeguards numerous jobs."
"For that reason alone, there is never too much we can do for European civil aviation or for the European space industry."
"In order to obtain a proper grasp of the economic significance of the aerospace industry, the Commission should produce a study on the volume of component supplies. That would be an important step."
"Above all, the study should include the percentage of total supplies drawn from small and medium-sized businesses and the number of staff employed by the component manufacturers."
"It would also be interesting to catalogue the countries of origin of the supplied components, since that would enable us to determine, for example, whether the Airbus really is a pan-European aircraft."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hoppenstedt's report contains an in-depth analysis of the situation in the European aerospace industry."
"It is an excellent report and on behalf of the Commission I must congratulate the rapporteur because he has also taken into account the main events that have occurred since September, that is since the approval by the Commission of its communication."
"I would remind you that the aim of this communication is to draw attention to the urgent need to accelerate restructuring and regrouping in the European aerospace industry."
"As you know, only a few aerospace companies can survive at world level in the long term given what this sector represents and given the degree of competition in the world aerospace market."
"The American industry has actually already begun restructuring."
"In 1980 there were about 20 companies whereas there are now only four."
"I can reassure Mr Malerba that we are agreeable to proper cooperation between America and Europe, of which there are some good examples, such as the Snecma/General Electric deal."
"However, we must be partners and not subcontractors."
"We must therefore be as strong in the world market as the Americans in order to be able to cooperate."
"The situation of the European industry is clearly different, as underlined by the rapporteur, given that it remains partitioned at national level and even in terms of its products."
"I believe Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned that the European aerospace industry now has to face three main challenges, the first of which is due to the complexity of the products."
"The exponential growth in development costs and the financial risks exceed the resources of the European aerospace companies, even the most powerful."
"The second factor relates to the market."
"No Member State has an armaments market equivalent to the American market."
"The same applies to the aid for research and technological development that American companies receive from the American Government."
"Finally, the third element involves the fact that the European aerospace companies cannot take advantage of the same economies of scale as the American giants."
"The Member States must therefore understand that the future of the European aerospace industry is linked to the interdependence of the structures existing within the European Union."
"Although the manufacturers must be the main protagonists in this restructuring, it is clear that the governments have a decisive role to play in this process."
"They must promote the creation of companies at European level by guaranteeing genuine commercial flexibility based on suitable support and training structures."
"In the Commission's opinion, the success of the restructuring will depend on the level of integration of the various branches of the aerospace sector and of civil and military activities at European level."
"As several MEPs have rightly stressed, the first stage in this restructuring should be the transformation, which has actually already been agreed, of Airbus Industrie into a single corporate entity involving the companies participating in the GIE."
"Furthermore, the European aerospace companies would profit from a Common Foreign and Security Policy and Community rules on the public armaments market."
"However, Mrs Ainardi, I must tell you that, in relation to 1980, the European aerospace industry is now much more oriented towards the civil side."
"In 1980 nearly 30 % of this industry's turnover was civil-related whereas this figure is now 60 %."
"Military activities therefore represent a small part of aerospace activities in Europe and are destined to shrink even more due to the growth in civil demand."
"Despite the difficulties caused by the problem of restructuring in the defence sector, the immediate progress to be made in the civil sector must not be delayed."
"I must also mention the employment problem at this point, in answer to Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Caudron."
"The question of the level of employment in the aerospace sector is implicit in the Commission's approach which aims to increase the competitiveness of this European industry."
"It is clearly by encouraging competitiveness that employment will be assisted, not only in the aerospace sector but also in other sectors."
"It is these efforts to increase competitiveness which have allowed the loss of jobs, which started in 1990, to be halted."
"The number of jobs has now stabilised at about 380 000."
"To conclude, I must stress to Mr Malerba and Mr de Lassus that the Commission is making new efforts in research and technological development to support this restructuring."
"However, the Commission is also initiating developments in air traffic and satellite navigation."
"You will remember that we prepared a communication on this subject in January 1998."
"The Commission will propose the approach to be taken with regard to satellite navigation in a new communication in the first half of 1999, together with financing proposals."
"Similarly, the Commission has drawn up proposals in terms of standardising and creating a single authority for aviation safety."
"Finally, only integrated action by the companies involved and the Member States can provide the framework needed for the survival and development of the European aerospace industry."
"Mr Hoppenstedt, your report is a useful contribution to this, and for this the Commission would like to thank you."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Euro coins"
"The next item is the report (A4-0401/98) by Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 975/98 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation (COM(98)0492 - C4-0597/98-98/0270(SYN))."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Silguy, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing today with the amendment of a regulation laying down the denominations and physical features of the euro coins to be put into circulation."
"Afterwards, I should like to add a few words on the subject of monetary union to my party colleague Mr Fischer in Rome."
"But I shall save that until the end."
"The problems that had to be resolved in this report related to the number of coins to be introduced, the denominations in which they would be produced, and lastly the choice of material and the physical characteristics of the coinage."
"At the time of the first reading, Parliament advocated a reduction in the proposed number of denominations of coin from eight to six, and a direct correlation between the diameter of the coins and their value to make them more distinguishable for visually impaired and blind people."
"When the Council, unfortunately, rejected this and other proposals, including moves to prevent the use of nickel on the surface of the coins, Parliament called on the Council once again in second reading to heed the opinion of the European Blind Union and reduce the number of coins."
"Once more, however, our pleas fell on deaf ears; as a result, in this draft regulation to correct a regulation that is barely six months old, we now read that slot-machine manufacturers are demanding a clear distinction between the 50 cent and 20 cent coins to avert the danger of fraudulent use of doctored 20 cent coins as 50 cent coins."
"The European Blind Union is not satisfied that the 50 cent and 10 cent coins are properly distinguishable, because their excessively similar physical characteristics could lead to confusion between the two."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy voted by a narrow majority against my proposing the scrapping of a denomination again in my report."
"Nevertheless, we shall have to produce a clear majority tomorrow on an amendment to that effect."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy did, however, favour the introduction of a gold 100 euro coin, and of course the material value and production cost of this coin must not significantly exceed its monetary value, which would mean that the 100 euro coin could perhaps be equal in size to a French 20 centime coin."
"I do not wish to go into any further detail, but I should certainly like to ask Mr de Silguy to think less in terms of losing face than of the fact that this gold euro coin is an inevitability."
"It is only a matter of time."
"With a view to enhancing the symbolic value of the 100 euro coin as the sign of a united Europe and a strong common currency, it should not have a national side as the other coins have, but should uniformly bear a powerful symbol of the European Union."
"Famous people, for instance, might feature on the coin."
"I think it is possible to reach agreement on that point as well."
"I indicated at the outset that I should also like to deal today with the results of the Rome meeting."
"May I therefore comment on the position adopted by my party colleague, Joschka Fischer, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, who today linked monetary union with the Western European Union, or so-called defence union."
"Now that monetary union has succeeded, as it were, and the first step has been taken, the way is considered to be clear to push for a common foreign and security policy and a stronger Western European Union."
"Mr Fischer is forging ahead too quickly."
"European monetary union is the first step."
"The second step is social and environmental union."
"That is the only way to develop a European economy."
"That is crucial."
"Unfortunately, my colleague from the Green Party is putting the cart before the horse."
"He is creating a stumbling-block for us and for himself."
"If monetary union is overloaded, which is what is happening here, there is a danger that it will collapse."
"Not all the European nations that have signed up for monetary union are also members of the Western European defence union."
"I earnestly urge him to think about that - to think, for example, about Austria, Finland and Ireland."
"The question here is whether the euro should be embraced at the expense of neutrality, which is an extremely delicate and sensitive issue."
"Is this the new German foreign policy?"
"Let me stress that Ireland, Finland and Austria will never submit to such ideas. Nor do I, incidentally, as a representative of the German Greens."
"Anyone who plays fast and loose with the neutrality of European nations is undermining confidence in the European ideal and in monetary union."
"I have emphasised that point because it has taken a long time to build up this confidence, and more time is needed to consolidate it."
"Nobody, whether it be the Green Foreign Minister or anyone else, should jeopardise this progress by overburdening monetary union with other objectives."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Silguy, ladies and gentlemen, I must say, like the rapporteur, that I too am aware that we currently have little room for improving the euro coins."
"My aim, like the report, is to highlight the case of the visually impaired, and also of many other categories of citizens."
"This is why I support the proposal to simply delete the 20 cent coin, which would solve some of the problems raised."
"I also support the proposal to change the definition of the edges of the 50 and 10 cent coins, which would solve some of the other problems."
"However, these problems once again demonstrate that time and money would have been saved if the citizens and Parliament had been consulted and heard more effectively."
"In this respect I must again express my regret at the decisions taken which mean that too many coins and notes are having to be produced."
"In addition, as a result of the ridiculous decision to have national faces on euro coins, we have a situation of longer production times, higher costs and greater risks of mistakes and fraud."
"Simpler and more reasonable decisions would have reduced the three-year production period expected from 1 January 1999 to 1 January 2002."
"This period will prove to be too long and will therefore lead to mistakes, fraud and even swindles affecting the weakest members of society."
"The visually impaired and all other citizens could have been better served."
"The rapporteur's proposals are therefore a step in the right direction and I support them."
"Finally, I also support the request for a gold 100 euro coin."
"I believe this is a good idea symbolically, economically and also emotionally."
"For all these reasons, I can confirm my support for the report and for the amendments which have already been approved in the main in committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago in Parliament we set out our principles: the introduction of a gold euro and the reduction of the coinage to six denominations, possibly eliminating the 2 and 20 cent pieces."
"Just as we did by advocating national designs on the reverse of the coins, we can use these measures to enhance people's emotional identification with their new currency while simplifying things at a practical level."
"For the period following the definitive introduction of the euro, we must also step up our efforts to study its practical implications in day-to-day transactions, or perhaps compile a study on the matter."
"For example, the lowest banknote, the five euro note, which is worth about 70 Austrian schillings, replaces not one but two of the most frequently used Austrian banknotes, namely the 50 schilling note and the 20 schilling note."
"These amounts will soon have to be paid in coins, which means that in future we shall have to carry large money bags around with us instead of wallets."
"Or will the development of electronic money be so far advanced by then that these problems might be avoided, or is it necessary to make a one or two euro note instead of printing 200 euro notes?"
"Perhaps these are not the things to be discussing when the euro is just about to be introduced, but I believe there is every reason to include such matters in our future considerations."
"Finally, I welcome the fact that the most recent statements do not question the independence of the European Central Bank."
"The Bank's independence must remain one of the cornerstones of economic union in order to ensure a prudent and above all a stable monetary policy, because that is still the only strategy capable of winning the trust of the European people."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly some of the proposed coins are vulnerable to fraud and hard to identify for blind people."
"Yet Parliament pressed in December 1997 for the number of coin denominations to be kept as small as possible and for their value to be linked to their diameter, precisely in an effort to prevent fraud and make life easier for blind people."
"A majority of the House, and the rapporteur has already stressed the point, thus failed to see why it should in fact be necessary to bring eight different coins into circulation, especially since electronic cash will shortly be replacing coins."
"As far as I know, there is not a single currency set which has so many different coins."
"The Council and Commission impressed upon us at the time that we needed to hurry, because production of the coins would be starting shortly."
"Perhaps it was thought that the design and manufacture of coins was a technical matter and that Parliament knew nothing at all about that kind of thing."
"Neither the Commission nor the finance ministers agreed at the time with our proposal that the 25 cent piece should be dropped."
"And what do we find now?"
"Even the experts could not manage to design coins which are easily recognisable to the blind and proof against fraud."
"We have wasted time, not because Parliament wanted to make amendments, but because we now have to go through the whole exercise again."
"It does not look as if the bodies responsible are going to take any notice of our opinion this time either - I hope I am wrong, Commissioner."
"It does, admittedly, make sense that the Commission should take account of the views of the European association for the blind and the vending machine manufacturers."
"I wholeheartedly endorse Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer's proposal, and I thank her for the way in which she has approached this matter."
"Mr President, I fully endorse the substance of the rapporteur's comments in so far as they referred to the social aspect of the coins."
"The Council has shown no signs of a social conscience in this matter."
"The introduction of the euro would be a unique opportunity to prove that the European Union is prepared to make a gesture for the benefit of those citizens whom fate has placed at a disadvantage."
"Many Member States are still in the Middle Ages anyway in terms of facilities for the disabled, at least by comparison with the United States."
"The opportunity to design these coins in such a way that those who are blind or visually impaired can easily identify their value by feeling them has sadly been squandered."
"This would have been a means of giving the euro a human dimension, so to speak."
"I am in favour of the introduction of a gold 100-euro coin, one reason being, as the rapporteur so eloquently put it in her report, that it would enrich the new currency by lending it an emotional aspect."
"Mr President, the amendments proposed by the European Commission are to be welcomed, since they are designed to help the visually impaired, to protect consumers and to thwart counterfeiters, as the rapporteur has indicated."
"To be perfectly honest, however, I must say that Parliament was aware of this a year ago and came up with some very sound proposals."
"The Commission considered the proposals to be good, but not practicable because of the timetable and the early deadline."
"I therefore find it regrettable that lobbying in the course of this year has resulted in changes being made to the draft regulation after all."
"I thought we in the European Parliament were still supposed to be the legitimate representatives of the consumers and citizens of Europe."
"I consider it right and proper that the 50 cent coin should be 0.8 grams heavier so that coin-operated machinery can distinguish more reliably between 50 cent and 20 cent coins."
"I consider it right and proper that the edge of the 50 cent coin should differ from that of the 10 cent coin, since it has proved difficult for people with visual impairments to distinguish between the two."
"For these reasons the proposal merits approval, but there seems to be no logical reason why Parliament's proposals in particular could not be implemented, given that our findings should have carried at least as much weight as those of the specialised associations."
"Every effort must now be made to ensure that these coins gain acceptance, not only in the financial markets and among financiers but also among the general public. Since monetary stability is so especially important to our citizens, the mints must be able to guarantee at this juncture that the currency will still be counterfeit-proof after these alterations, for I believe that was one of the arguments used against the European Parliament proposals."
"I also endorse the rapporteur's view that we need a sort of stability symbol in this economic and monetary union which will grow into a community rooted in stability."
"What is the reason for minting a 100 euro coin in gold?"
"I believe there is every reason."
"For one thing, the proposal is consistent with the decision of the European System of Central Banks to hold only 15 % of currency reserves in the form of gold."
"In view of the high gold reserves held by the national central banks, this proposal makes sense from both a monetary and an economic point of view, because it precludes the adverse effects on the price of gold that would result from any dissolution of gold reserves."
"A gold euro coin can also help to build confidence in the stable foundations of monetary union. That is certainly an important reason."
"In the past, many European governments have used metal and its value to prove their commitment to stability."
"A euro coin made of gold can therefore continue this laudable tradition."
"That is why it is high time that the European finance ministers and the central banks decided in favour of the gold euro coin, because unless the resistance of the central banks is overcome, another initiative will come to naught."
"If there is a surprisingly heavy demand for these coins which creates an imbalance between their market value and their nominal value - and I say this partly to calm one or two fears - production of the gold coins could be halted."
"That has happened with other coins, such as the French silver coin."
"But in that case too, the effect of the initial commitment was to stabilise the franc."
"The finance ministers' argument that there cannot be a 100 euro coin because there is already a 100 euro note seems a fallacious one to me."
"Such duplication occurs in certain monetary denominations in many countries."
"It is possible, after all, to ensure that banknotes and coins of the same denomination are not competing for public favour."
"The 100 euro coin is also an overdue successor to the 200 franc Napoleon coin which circulated throughout Europe; it will be a collector's piece, a coin of value, a symbol which may well help the euro to win over the hearts and minds of the European people."
"Mr President, everything has been said, but not by everyone and certainly not by me."
"For that reason, I should like to add a few words on the subject in general."
"I find it marvellous that Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer has been grappling so valiantly with this report and is still doing so, even though the striking presses have long been working to produce the coins we have discussed here today."
"I am also gratified that all the things we had proposed in the past have now been put on the table here by the Commission, especially the proposals that affect the 11 million Europeans with impaired vision."
"I believe this emphasises the fact that we are canvassing for confidence in the new currency within this section of the population too."
"With the introduction of the euro only a few weeks away, confidence-building measures are precisely what is needed, and they are precisely what these proposals will help to achieve."
"I find it really rather comforting to note that - as Mr Rübig has also spelled out here - the German Minister of Finance has come right back into the race at the final bend by endorsing the call for confidence-building measures, instead of standing on the sidelines casting doubt on the sovereignty and independence of the Central Bank with ill-considered statements."
"I can only re-emphasise a point that is beyond doubt here in Parliament as elsewhere, namely that the European Central Bank must retain its independence - and it will, because there has been no indication that it will not - if it is to achieve its foremost objective of guaranteeing price stability."
"Price stability, as we all know, happens to be one of the basic economic conditions that encourage investments, thereby promoting growth and employment."
"Let me quote Wim Duisenberg again, who told us here that stable money is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustained economic growth and to the long-term reduction of unemployment."
"I wish you all good-night!"
"Mr President, I have one or two minor points to make."
"I understand why the rapporteur wishes to see one of the coins abandoned, but I would warn against minting a coin as big as the 100 euro in gold."
"There are two reasons why I am so reticent."
"Firstly, such a coin would never actually function as a coin."
"Secondly, it would encourage counterfeiting and fraud."
"A 100 euro gold coin is never going to stabilise the price of gold, which is dictated by supply and demand."
"If the price of gold were to rise above the face value of the coins, these would find their way out of circulation."
"Were the price were to drop below face value, people would be encouraged to buy gold and make their own coins."
"It is worth remembering how much easier it is to counterfeit coins than banknotes."
"Mr President, even if - contrary to all expectations - the price of gold were to match the face value, it would still be easy to counterfeit such a coin."
"Lead weighs much the same as gold."
"There is no wizardry involved in making a lead coin and then covering it with a thin layer of gold. This fraudulent exercise could be very profitable."
"My message to you today is that I really do not think that putting a 100 euro gold coin into circulation would be a very good idea!"
"Mr President, I will try to be as quick as possible so that I do not try everyone's patience at this late hour."
"Firstly I must congratulate Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer and thank her for supporting the Commission's proposal."
"I will very quickly answer the two questions posed, one on the content of the regulation and the second on the issue of the gold 100 euro coin in which interest was shown during the first debate on the Commission's proposal last November."
"The reasons for and content of this proposal are as follows: we have proposed amending the basic regulation for purely technical reasons."
"We do not want to re-open last year's debate on the national face or on the number of coins."
"This proposal is in response to purely technical problems involving two coins, the 50 cent coin and the 10 cent coin. These problems have arisen since the adoption of the regulation."
"Why?"
"The answer is that the use of these coins must be made easier for the visually impaired and the blind."
"They have asked us to do this and there is no reason not to meet their request. They must be able to easily distinguish between the coins."
"Furthermore, we must ensure that identification of the coins by vending machines will be as accurate as possible."
"These problems arose after the mint-masters, on the basis of the regulation of 3 May, produced the much more detailed specifications needed for the production of the coins and when the first coin samples resulting from an industrial production process could be tested."
"Two sets of necessary but very limited modifications are therefore proposed to solve these two technical problems."
"Firstly, the weight of the 50 cent coin must be increased slightly to allow easier differentiation between it and the 20 cent coin, and secondly, the definition of the edges of the 10 and 50 cent coins must be changed by replacing the coarse milling with a shaped edge with fine scallops."
"This will allow the coins to be more easily identified by touch. I would point out to Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens that agreement has been reached with the European Blind Union on this point."
"It was at their explicit request that we accepted these modifications which are purely technical and very limited and which do not bring into question the coinage system already specified and adopted. I would add that the production of coins has already started, or at least of those coins which are not affected by these modifications."
"With regard to the second problem of the gold 100 euro coin, in the Commission's opinion this request cannot be considered in the context of the Regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins as this requires in-depth consideration."
"The Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, must remind you that, under Article 105a (2), the regulation relates solely to the harmonisation of coins intended for circulation."
"A gold 100 euro coin would pose risks of confusion and fraud and there is also a risk that these coins would be collected rather than used."
"Mr Wibe clearly explained these risks just now, specifically with regard to the existence of a 100 euro note."
"The intrinsic value of a 100 euro coin could exceed its spatial value following fluctuations in the price of gold."
"It is considered that for easier use and to be aesthetically pleasing, a 100 euro coin would have to have a face value of EUR 300 to 400."
"However, I have taken on board the concerns about the attachment of the population to the euro and the symbolic nature of the issue of this coin and we must examine this, together with all the competent authorities, regardless of the amendment of the regulation in line with Article 105a (2)."
"Not including this coin in the regulation does not prevent the possibility of the Member States, if they so desire, issuing a gold coin whose characteristics could be harmonised by mutual agreement, on a voluntary basis."
"However, under the legislation in force on commemorative and collectors' coins, the legal status of such a coin would come under national law."
"This coin could therefore be legal tender throughout the euro zone but it might only be legal tender in the country of issue."
"At my request, the Commission services have contacted the mint-masters, the European Central Bank and the Monetary Committee no later than yesterday evening, and I can confirm that there is real interest in this proposal among the mint-masters."
"However, there is a certain amount of reticence among the Ministries of Finance and the European Central Bank."
"The technical aspects involved in the issue of such a gold coin require an exhaustive study to be carried out and these aspects cannot be defined at this stage."
"Similarly, the time of issue would also have to be carefully chosen in order to prevent any risk of confusion during the introduction of the coins and notes intended for circulation."
"To conclude, I must stress the importance attached by the Commission to your proposal and I must say that the Commission is prepared, even though this proposal does not come directly under its competence, to report to the Council and to assist as far as possible with a feasibility study by all the parties concerned, whether mint-masters, issuing authorities, Ministries of Finance, national central banks or the European Central Bank."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 0.10 a.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, yesterday I raised a point regarding a camera stationed outside the Chamber with its light peering in through one of the doors."
"In addition to this, I was proceeding along the corridor yesterday afternoon when a cameraman was walking backwards filming a Member of this House."
"Not only was this a hazard to the cameraman's life and limb but it was also a hazard to any Member's life and limb."
"I would ask the House and you, Mr President, as I know you treat this place with some dignity - much more than I do on occasions - to investigate these matters and perhaps advise us how these practices can be stopped."
"Thank you for informing us of this, Mr Falconer."
"Fortunately, this practice of walking backwards is not one that has been widely adopted either by Members or officials, but we shall look into what was going on."
"Mr President, on a point of order relating to Rule 41(1), we obviously had a linguistic misunderstanding on Monday."
"So I have to raise this matter again."
"On Monday, I objected to the deletion of Question Time to the Council from today's agenda."
"You said the agenda was adopted as it stood because no group had objected."
"But it says in our Rules of Procedure: 'Question Time to the Council and Commission shall be held at each part-session'."
"I wish to make that point. I believe we must observe the Rules of Procedure, even if not a single group has objected to the agenda."
"Mr Posselt, this issue always raises problems because the Rules of Procedure also state that Question Time shall be held at such times as may be decided by Parliament on a proposal from the Conference of Presidents."
"If the proposal from the Conference of Presidents is that it should not take place - and this is not the first time that this has happened, since it has unfortunately happened on a number of occasions -, then I cannot go against their wishes or force them to make a proposal to that effect."
"It has always been parliamentary practice to ensure that Question Time takes place but there are exceptions to the rule - as in this case - and if matters on the agenda prevent it from taking place, then it may be that it does not indeed take place."
"However, I note your comments and will forward them to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure so that it might inform us as to whether our interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, which has been used until now, is acceptable or not."
"I would also like to point out that we have very limited scope for action in this respect because the Council is usually only present one day of the week in Strasbourg."
"I have already requested that in one of the next tripartite discussions the Council be given the opportunity to extend its presence an extra day, so that Question Time can take place, although not necessarily on Wednesday afternoons."
"Mr President, I want to add to what my colleague, Mr Falconer has said."
"I also saw a film crew yesterday along the corridor filming some of our employees moving a trunk."
"I am not sure why that should be of such importance."
"I suspect the programme was not one showing the wonderful work that we do within this Parliament."
"I will ask DG 3 to look into what happened and I will give you and Mr Falconer the information as soon as we get it."
"Since there are no further comments, the Minutes are approved."
"Mr President, I would like to inform you and all Members of the House that, late yesterday evening, the Conciliation Committee reached a conclusion on the fifth framework programme."
"It has been very hard work - this was the fourth meeting - and I have to say that, as usual, codecision with a Council operating under the unanimity rule was an unequal struggle."
"But all the members of the delegation and all the political groups faced up to it with intelligence, persistence and great determination."
"The House will be asked to give its opinion on the work done by the delegation in December, but I think I can already say that everyone really did act very positively and I believe now is the time, while bringing you up to date, to thank all the members of the delegation who took part in the conciliation."
"Thank you very much, Mr Imbeni."
"This really is good news, given the particular difficulties involved in these negotiations."
"And, in addition to thanking all Members, I think we also must give you special thanks for the effort you have made to secure the success of the conciliation."
"Mr President, I should like to inform you that yesterday evening, after six hours of continuous voting, the Committee on Legal Affairs approved the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament almost unanimously."
"I would like to thank and sincerely congratulate the rapporteur and all the members of the committee, who have worked very hard to ensure that the agreement reached in the Conference of Presidents was observed."
"We will therefore shortly be publicly debating the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr De Clercq."
"Agenda 2000"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the guidelines for Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 is a central issue for the Austrian Presidency, as it is also in the European Parliament's debates."
"This is an important day for Agenda 2000, because the European Parliament will be determining its positions during this part-session."
"So I am glad to have this opportunity to report briefly, at the beginning of the debate, on the progress of work in the Council."
"Let me underline again at the outset that the Austrian Presidency attaches great importance to constructive cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament on this matter."
"Each of our institutions has a very substantial role to play in accomplishing this great reform project."
"We will only manage to keep to the demanding timetable set by the European Council in Cardiff if we have an open exchange of views and effective coordination."
"As early as June this year, the presidency agreed to take note of Parliament's views through regular contacts with Parliament and through its usual participation in plenary sittings and the appropriate meetings of Parliament's committees, to ensure that the European Parliament is kept constantly informed of progress made in the Council's work and to inform the Council of the results of Parliament's discussions and the content of its reports, of which the Council will then take due account."
"I am glad to be able to say today that, to this end, Parliament and the Council have now agreed to initiate a regular, informal dialogue on the general trend of the discussions on Agenda 2000."
"The Commission will also take part in this dialogue."
"The first meetings on the subjects of pre-accession instruments, reform of the common agricultural policy and reform of structural policy will take place at political level by the end of November or beginning of December."
"They will give Parliament in particular an opportunity to clarify its positions on Agenda 2000, which it is debating today and will vote on tomorrow."
"To ensure continuity, the future German Presidency will also be represented."
"The Austrian Presidency regards Agenda 2000 as one of its main challenges."
"From the outset, we have considerably intensified the work in the various working groups and in COREPER."
"This Agenda is an important theme of every General Affairs Council, as it is for the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture."
"There is not a day that passes without intensive work on elements of the package."
"Let me briefly summarise the main points relating to the state of the negotiations."
"Firstly, regarding the financial perspective for 2000-2006, there is general agreement that when the financial perspective is drawn up, account must be taken both of the need for budgetary discipline - efficiency in relation to expenditure - and of the need to make resources available for the adequate further development of Union policies."
"We have managed to reach agreement on the demarcation of pre-accession and accession-related expenditure."
"The overall structure of the financial perspective - allowing for the separate description and calculation of the expenditure for pre-accession and the new Member States - and the seven-year period of validity from 2000 to 2006, with a projected adjustment at the time of the first accessions, have met with broad support, although some Member States take the view that the financial perspective needs to be reviewed for each accession."
"The average growth rates on which the Commission has based this will have to be constantly reviewed in the light of the most recent economic data, since annual growth rates can fluctuate considerably over a period of seven years."
"The Commission is starting out from the working hypothesis that the ceiling for Union resources should be fixed at a constant value of 1.27 % of the EU GNP as from the year 2000."
"This has also received broad support, although the negotiations on it have not yet been concluded."
"Agreement on the total amounts under the various expenditure headings will probably not be reached until the final stage of the negotiations."
"The bodies responsible are currently also holding intensive discussions on the concept of stabilising expenditure in the new financial perspective."
"The meetings of the Finance Ministers on 23 November and 1 December will be most important."
"They will be concerned with continuing the discussion on key issues and identifying options for solutions in this area."
"The Commission presented the report on the functioning of the own resources system to the European Parliament on 7 October and to ECOFIN on 12 October."
"The report discusses various methods of further developing the own resources system and resolving the problem of excessive budgetary imbalances."
"There has been little evidence of convergence in the discussions so far in ECOFIN and the General Affairs Council."
"Considerable efforts will still be required here with a view to finding generally acceptable solutions."
"Regarding the Interinstitutional Agreement, good progress has been made in recent weeks in the negotiations on the Council's position on a new agreement of this kind."
"That enabled us, jointly with the European Parliament, to embark on the technical evaluation of the Commission proposal on 12 November."
"I hope that this work will make good headway."
"Regarding the reform of structural policy, very major efforts have been made during the Austrian Presidency."
"I believe that overall we have made good progress here."
"There is agreement in principle on the following points and the corresponding technical regulations."
"One: there is broad support in principle for the concept of spatial concentration and concentration of the eligible Community population."
"The number of objectives is to be cut from seven to three."
"Two: the planning and implementation of the programmes are to be simplified and speeded up."
"Decision-making is to be more decentralised than in the past. Financial management and control are to be improved."
"Three: in future structural policy, clear emphasis is to be placed on job creation and safeguarding competitiveness and sustainable development."
"Four: the number of Community initiatives is to be reduced substantially, while giving precedence to Interreg."
"Five: transitional rules are needed for Objective 1 and Objective 2 areas losing their eligibility."
"The Council has now to a large extent determined its positions on the regulations on the Regional Development Fund - the ERDF - and the Social Fund - the ESF."
"Most of the technical work on the Cohesion Fund is completed."
"What still remains open is the question of the eligibility for assistance of the participants in economic and monetary union."
"Some of the key political issues in the continuing negotiations involve establishing more precisely the definitions and criteria of the individual objectives and clarifying the transitional rules."
"Then, of course, there are also the key financial questions relating to structural policy, which will probably not be clarified until the final stage of the negotiations."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words on the pre-accession instruments."
"We take a very positive view of the progress of negotiations on the Commission's three legislative proposals for a coordinating regulation and structural and agricultural policy pre-accession instruments."
"Difficult questions needed to be resolved here, in particular the distribution of resources after the first accessions and guaranteeing sound financial management, together with control of the use of resources."
"We are pleased that the General Affairs Council of 9 November managed to achieve political agreement on the three pre-accession instruments, subject to a reservation about the level of the ceiling of assistance rates."
"That has clarified a first, important component of Agenda 2000 in political terms, although of course this aspect depends on overall agreement on that Agenda, given that it is a package."
"Above all, this progress sends out a positive signal to the applicants for accession, who expect the Union to give vigorous support to their reform efforts."
"I will not sum up the state of negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy, because as you know, my colleague Mr Molter, the Minister for Agriculture, will be giving you very detailed information on that this afternoon."
"All in all, we can certainly say that concrete progress has been made on many aspects of Agenda 2000 over the past five months."
"During the next very busy months, we will make further efforts to achieve real headway in clarifying the key questions."
"Our aim must be to make substantial progress, so that by the Vienna European Council we have created conditions that will allow the decisive final stage of the negotiations on the overall package to start on schedule at the beginning of 1999."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, today's sitting marks an important step in the process which must, before the end of this parliamentary term, result in the adoption of all the measures proposed under Agenda 2000."
"The Cardiff European Council and the recent informal meeting of the Heads of State and Government at Pörtschach expressed the political will to conclude the negotiations on Agenda 2000 at a special summit next March."
"I am delighted that the new German Chancellor gave a very clear indication at Pörtschach of his determination to successfully conclude this work."
"My Commission colleagues will discuss in detail our reactions to your reports."
"I should like to remind you of the political importance of the Agenda 2000 package. As you know, it involves the following three strands: substantial reform of EU policies, preparation for the most ambitious enlargement of the EU to date and, finally, the development of adequate and reasonable financing within the ceiling agreed at Edinburgh."
"The Commission believes that it has always been clear that a reform of our policies and an agreement on financing in the context of the financial perspective were essential to prepare Europe for the 21st century."
"The prospect of future enlargement adds to the importance of the global reforms contained in Agenda 2000."
"Why must we reach agreement by March?"
"There are several reasons for this: firstly, the approaching European Parliament elections which will have an impact on the activities of this House from March or April; secondly, the damage which a delay would cause to the credibility of the EU and to confidence; and finally, practical considerations linked to the programming of the Structural Funds and the establishment of policies, and also the negative effect on the accession process itself of any delay in implementing the pre-accession instruments."
"Can agreement be reached by March?"
"I believe so, because all the relevant information is available, including the Commission's 19 detailed proposals, considered in your reports, and also the Commission's report on own resources."
"Aware of the problem of financing the EU budget, the Commission chose to bring forward by a year its report on the operation of the own resources system."
"This report was adopted by the Members of the Commission at the beginning of October."
"I must say that this is an innovative document from the Commission as it agrees to an in-depth study of the EU budgetary situation, including the delicate question of the 'net balances'."
"What was the reason for this?"
"It was not because we enjoy tackling this difficult and over-simplistic concept but because of a desire for objectivity and Community spirit, to allow the discussions to take place in an open manner and on sound bases."
"Parliament's role in this is clearly legislative, first and foremost."
"While maintaining a global approach, Parliament has chosen to use every possible option to assert its point of view and, where the Treaty provides for this, to fully exercise its prerogatives."
"Thanks to your cooperative attitude and substantive contributions, today's sitting will allow considerable progress to be made."
"The Commission will listen attentively to Parliament and try to respond substantively to your observations."
"We all know that the concurrence of the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and the end of your parliamentary term may pose certain problems."
"There are some aspects of Agenda 2000 which will be subject to the codecision procedure following ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I would therefore highlight the responsibility of all the institutions to rapidly conclude an interinstitutional agreement that will allow a seamless transition to the codecision procedure."
"Such an agreement is generally required in all cases where there is a changeover from the cooperation procedure to the codecision procedure."
"However, Parliament does not just have a legislative role."
"As one of the two branches of the budgetary authority, it will be a signatory to a new interinstitutional budget agreement."
"The current agreement has proven to be very useful in maintaining budgetary peace and in guaranteeing a moderate increase in expenditure."
"In the Commission's opinion, the conclusion of a new agreement that satisfies both branches of the budgetary authority is an integral part of Agenda 2000."
"I am delighted that the initial technical discussions on a new agreement have finally begun."
"Yet we must not rest on our laurels."
"There is not much time between now and next March and we must intensify the in-depth discussions."
"The adoption of the Agenda 2000 package is in the general interest of the Community."
"We should all consider the consequences that a lack of agreement, before the European elections, would have on the new impetus in the EU created by the introduction of the euro."
"I would therefore ask everyone to intensify their efforts before the Vienna European Council in order to ensure a good starting point for the discussions that must be concluded under the German Presidency."
"Clearly, until there is agreement on every aspect, there will be no agreement."
"However, mindful of this reservation, I hope that we will achieve three objectives in Vienna."
"We must firstly obtain agreement on the 'technical' aspects of the legislative texts."
"In this respect, I am delighted at the progress achieved recently in the Structural and Cohesion Funds, the pre-accession strategy and the trans-European networks."
"Secondly, we must try to make progress in more political areas, for example in certain aspects of the agricultural and rural development reforms, of the structural measures and in the 'format' of the financial perspectives."
"Finally, we must outline a final package that should concentrate in particular on the financial implications of the reforms and of connected budgetary questions."
"I have tried to briefly outline the challenges facing us in the coming months."
"The Commission is fully aware of the important role to be played by Parliament in this respect before your parliamentary term comes to an end."
"On many occasions in the past you have proven your intention to play this role seriously and with the necessary responsibility."
"Today's work must be treated similarly and the Commission will willingly contribute to this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the decisions on Agenda 2000 are the central challenge facing the European Union, and therefore also the European Parliament, in the next six months."
"Before we discuss the individual reports in detail, I would like to make a few general points on behalf of my group."
"What is the real issue?"
"Firstly, it is about helping the Central and Eastern European countries to become eligible for accession."
"We welcome the Commission's proposals on pre-accession aid."
"We also welcome the instruments that have now been developed - or at least their main features."
"We do not see this pre-accession aid as a bonus or premium for the Eastern and Central European countries, but we say that it is also in our own economic and political interest."
"It is also clear, however, that it is the countries applying for accession themselves that must make the main efforts to qualify for accession."
"Secondly, we ourselves, the European Union, are still not ready for enlargement."
"Considerable efforts are still needed before we are prepared."
"We regard the concept of Agenda 2000, as presented by the Commission, as the master plan for making the European Union ready for enlargement over the next six months."
"This applies to reform of its policies."
"It also applies to the financial perspective up to the year 2006."
"In recent weeks and months, I have heard much criticism from the Member States, as also from the European Parliament and from my group, of individual Agenda 2000 proposals."
"I think that is only normal."
"It will happen again today."
"But let me make one point at the start of the debate: to date, I have not heard any Member State, any Union body or any parliamentary group propose a counter-plan that would be as consistent in itself, as coherent and as likely to achieve a majority as the one the Commission has presented."
"That is why my group will endorse the basic features of Agenda 2000, its essential points, in the form proposed by the Commission."
"Perhaps I might try to list one or two of these points."
"We regard job creation, the sustained economic growth and the competitiveness of the EU regions as the most important objectives in the reform of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, but also in the necessary reform of the EU agricultural policy."
"We underline the need for Structural and Cohesion Fund measures to be environment-friendly, more environment-friendly than in the past."
"We want regional and local organisations, but also our citizens, to be more closely involved in the planning and implementation of regional programmes."
"We also hope to see simpler and more responsible fund management, and the appropriate Commission proposals."
"The PSE Group has taken a clear stance on a range of disputed points."
"The group supports the EU Commission's proposals on the Objective 1 criteria, but insists that the European Parliament must carefully examine any necessary exceptions."
"The group supports the Commission's proposal to maintain Cohesion Fund allocations of about ECU 20 billion for the least developed Member States."
"The group firmly supports the aim of reducing the number of Community initiatives, as it does the precedence given to Interreg, but we call for the URBAN programme to be retained and hope an initiative will be set up for regions exposed to unexpectedly severe economic and social restructuring."
"We insist that the aid for those regions that will no longer be entitled to aid after the year 2000 should be reduced gradually, while also saying that the transitional stage should last up to six years and that no distinctions should then be made."
"Finally, we support the Commission's intention to bring about greater coherence between national aids and measures and EU Objective 2 measures."
"Here we certainly need greater flexibility."
"These are the positions endorsed by my group, at least by a large majority."
"Let me add a general point of principle: if we only discuss how much some Member States have to pay and how much a few others receive, we shall not be doing justice to the scale of the decision we are facing, in Parliament and in the Council."
"In our view, all reforms - not just institutional reforms aimed at enlargement, but also reforms of our policies - are not only targeted at enlargement of the European Union; in fact they also serve as an opportunity."
"They are an opportunity to breathe fresh air into the EU policy-making of the past."
"Basically, we would still have to carry them out even if we were not faced with enlargement."
"To underline it once again, with these reforms we are aiming to concentrate what we can do as a Community and a Union."
"We are not aiming to demolish anything in the Member States, and we are not aiming to demolish the EU's policies."
"Madam President-in-Office, you spoke of constructive cooperation and coordination of our activities."
"Let me say a few words on that."
"I do not have the impression that all the Member States, or rather the governments in the Council, have understood yet that Parliament's role has changed, have understood that in fact the European Parliament now has codecision powers through assent on the regulations on the reform of the Structural Funds and on the Cohesion Fund."
"That means that it must also be in the interest of the Council to enter into an interinstitutional dialogue with Parliament after this first reading, not just on the financial perspective, because that is routine and always happens, but also on the reform of EU policies and on the position of the European Parliament and the Council, which will have to be prepared in future."
"If the dialogue to which you referred only consists of Parliament reporting and the Council listening but apart from that remaining silent, as would seem to be the idea, then let me tell you that is not enough for us!"
"Then you are in danger of seeing all the reforms that need to be made running into a brick wall."
"We want to decide Agenda 2000 during this parliamentary term, before the elections."
"We are prepared to adhere to the timetable."
"Let the Council do the same!"
"We need to have the Council's position by the end of March, so do not expect Parliament to give you a pretext for not keeping to your own timetable!"
"We know that the political, economic, social and ecological future of the whole of Europe is in our hands, in the hands of the Commission, in the hands of the Council, but also - and not least - in the hands of the European Parliament."
"You may be sure we are aware of that!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the success of Agenda 2000 with the necessary reforms it involves is the condition for achieving European integration at the beginning of the 21st century."
"On 1 January 1999, European monetary union will become a reality - an historic event that many people in Europe still considered impossible only a few years ago."
"Monetary union is an example that shows that Europe can make great historic progress and is able to do so if the political actors summon up the necessary resolve."
"But it is not enough just to have resolute political actors."
"The people of Europe must be able to have confidence in the European Union's decisions."
"In fact the people do not want less Europe, they want more."
"They want a convincing Europe, a Europe capable of acting at home and abroad, a Europe that is free of corruption and abuse of power, a Europe that serves the people and their interests."
"It is on that basis that Agenda 2000 must become a story of success."
"I would like to address four tasks."
"Firstly, the top priority is enlargement of the European Union with the accession of the Central and Eastern European countries."
"The negotiations to that end must be conducted as rapidly as possible, so that the ten nations of central Europe can share the European Union's common values."
"This means that the enlargement process must take a flexible and transparent form."
"It means that those countries which are not in the first round of the negotiations can quickly move up that to level when they make the necessary progress."
"We must avoid giving the impression that the people in some applicant countries are excluded from the negotiation and enlargement process, because it is important to these countries' will to reform that they are also aware that they can soon share the European Union's common values."
"The second major task is to reform the common policies, with particular reference to agricultural and structural policy."
"Agricultural policy must make its contribution to enabling efficient farms to stand up to competition."
"But agricultural policy is not just a policy for farming; it must increasingly include the rural area as a whole."
"Conditions in Europe differ from those in the USA."
"So Agenda 2000 must make its contribution to the further development of the European agricultural model and thereby to safeguarding it."
"Structural policy is aimed at solidarity with structurally weak regions."
"I firmly support concentrating these resources, in terms of geographical area and content, on the structurally weak areas."
"But we also believe that the regions in what are regarded as the wealthier countries that are no longer eligible for EU assistance must continue to receive a certain amount of state aid, under a sensible competition policy which compares the structurally weak areas in these countries with the wealthy regions in the same countries."
"The third task concerns reform of the European Union's institutions."
"We are all familiar with the Amsterdam protocol."
"But the reorganisation of the Commission, the new weighting of votes in the Council, is not the crucial issue."
"What really is crucial is to expand majority decision-making in the Council so that the European Union is able to act now and will be able to do so in future after enlargement."
"That is the basic condition: majority decisions in the Council for European Union legislation."
"Let me address a fourth aspect."
"There has been a government agreement in the Federal Republic of Germany under which the government parties are to be entitled to both posts in the Commission."
"This deviates from the principle that the opposition is entitled to one post."
"If this becomes accepted practice in the European Union, in the Member States, it would put the political architecture in the Commission at risk."
"Under the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament has a new role to play."
"The President of the Commission is elected."
"The Commission is appointed by agreement between the President of the Commission and the national governments, after which the Commission as a whole is subject to a vote of confidence by the European Parliament."
"If we were to have a one-sided Commission in the year 2000, at the beginning of Agenda 2000, that would not be a good start and it could lead to a conflict with the European Parliament, at least with my group."
"That is why we believe we must maintain the balance in the Commission."
"It must include all political persuasions so that it can contribute to stability and peace in the Europe of the 21st century."
"Mr President, I must say that I cannot see in Agenda 2000 the historic values on which the idea of the European Community was founded. Instead of real values, we see monetary values - a currency."
"Furthermore, it does not seem to me that the ideals have been maintained, especially in respect of the subject that I know best. This is going to be the subject of my speech as it is one of interest to my group, namely the common agricultural policy."
"It does not, in fact, contain any concrete proposals but makes an underhand attempt to undermine one of the basic principles of the CAP, perhaps the most important, that of financial solidarity - which is also a form of moral solidarity -, through poorly concealed proposals to renationalise the CAP by creating national envelopes for the beef and milk sectors."
"There is also a desire - one that is not concealed - to maintain the negative discriminations against less productive and less developed forms of agriculture by indexing the calculations of compensatory amounts on historical productivity rates. That will maintain a schizophrenic Europe, one divided between extremely poor countries and countries that are not poor for natural reasons or for reasons linked to their own national history."
"As if Agenda 2000 and its legislative proposals were not enough, the Commission has now attacked agriculture and European farmers, especially the most fragile, in its report on the system of own resources by proposing the partial reimbursement of expenditure as direct aid from the CAP."
"We are all equally aware that the CAP, the only genuinely common policy so far, is the cement of the construction of Europe. That is without referring to enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, or the millennium round of the World Trade Organisation."
"Nor does it include even yesterday's statements here by the President of the Court of Auditors, who overstepped his functions as a judge to give his opinion on the aid given to durum wheat in the poorest countries. This smacks of a confusion of powers and goes against what old Montesquieu and old Locke preached about the defence of democracy."
"Finally, in Agenda 2000, the least-favoured regions will continue to be least-favoured and the most-favoured will become richer and richer."
"The gap can only widen; of that I do not have the slightest doubt."
"Mr President, the challenge of the enlargement of the European Union can and must be approached in such a way so as to ensure that we achieve the major objectives in the process of the construction of Europe and particularly those concerning economic and social cohesion."
"This is why we feel justified in our severe criticism of Agenda 2000, because it was drawn up in haste as an irreversible decision and without being thoroughly assessed."
"It is a great paradox that Agenda 2000 was drawn up to facilitate enlargement and that, since then, it has scarcely been referred to in the proposals and arguments put forward."
"Public opinion in the Member States sees the debate as one that centres on own resources and the insufficient ceiling of 1.27 % of Community GDP, as well as on the much disputed allocation of solidarity through the Structural Funds."
"That is the major difference in terms of this debate with the Delors stage, when successive increases in both resources and the size of the Structural Funds were proposed."
"The debate does not adequately address the issue and does not bear in mind the fact that we must not only build an internal market but that, above all, we must achieve economic and social cohesion."
"Instead of simply talking about net contributors and beneficiaries, we should explain who benefits and by how much in an overall economic assessment, since the most significant economic policies are not reflected in the budget."
"We cannot ignore the enormous profits that some economies in the large internal market are making, whilst others are paying the economic and commercial price."
"Our main criticism in relation to the common agricultural policy is that there is no overall view and it only refers to certain sectors of production."
"The reforms of the COMs will lead to substantial price reductions that will be compensated to a very small extent by income support and premiums for private storage."
"Time will show this to be the case."
"We are concerned about the effects involved both in social terms and in terms of employment that will affect the weakest farmers."
"We are also concerned about the introduction of cofinancing since it does not solve the problems."
"The solution should be found in genuine proposals to regulate direct aid aimed at correcting the present unfair imbalances."
"In our opinion - and with all due respect -, the Commission's proposal is no more than a vague attempt at regulation that will merely serve to exacerbate the present imbalances."
"Therefore, we are convinced that further efforts will still be needed to achieve a successful enlargement and also to solve the serious contradictions and insufficiencies that exist in our socio-economic and institutional lives before enlargement takes place."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after all the solemn declarations in Brussels, Luxembourg and London about the historic significance of enlargement, it now appears that the Council is moving down a gear."
"There appears to be a climate emerging in which instead of the old Iron Curtain we now have a smokescreen of fine words concealing the Council's true intentions, which are to postpone the accession of new members."
"We are perfectly well aware that we are dealing with an unprecedented enlargement operation here that places extremely heavy demands on all countries, both our own and the applicant countries."
"The excellent progress reports which the Commission presented to us at the beginning of November show the efforts the applicant countries have made to meet the Copenhagen criteria, but they are paying a heavy price for the changes they are having to make."
"Sizeable groups of the population are now poverty-stricken, as anyone who goes there regularly will have noticed."
"This is why we want to draw attention to the fact that the establishment of a smoothly running market economy often degenerates into nothing more than an insistence on rapid privatisation."
"The situation in Russia, for example, shows that privatisation which enables a small number of people to monopolise a country's wealth is definitely not a sound basis for a socially adjusted free market."
"So the Commission and the Council should be insisting not just on rapid privatisation, but on responsible privatisation with the necessary mechanisms for political and social adjustment."
"Compared with the enormous efforts that the applicant countries have made, the Council's approach has been far too laid back, in our view."
"What progress have we actually made?"
"Institutional reform has been put on the back burner, and there is no sign yet of agricultural reform."
"In fact, all the indications are that we are going to continue with the old system of producer price reductions and exporting structural surpluses, rather than moving over to integrated rural development."
"On finance, we are still calling for an open approach that would allow us to adjust the volume of funding if necessary."
"For us, the key words here are participation and decentralisation."
"Decentralisation of funding is now a reality, fortunately, but we have still not settled the question of the participation of representatives of the applicant countries in the advisory committees deciding on projects."
"The recent report on nuclear safety by the Court of Auditors notes the Commission's embarrassing failure to improve the safety of nuclear power stations in the applicant countries."
"The issue was actually taken up by the western European nuclear lobby, which was intending to use its own extremely expensive experts and export its own equipment, with disastrous results on the ground."
"We can understand that the Commission should play a coordinating role in all this, but none of the programmes like TACIS, PHARE, BIRD and so on were put to best use at all."
"We wholeheartedly support the proposals to start negotiations very soon with Latvia and later with Lithuania and Slovakia, and we were very pleased to see in the Joint Committee that our openness towards Turkey is producing immediate results, in that the Turkish representatives are now reacting differently to the European Union."
"Above all, we must prevent the Union from being held to ransom by Greece and Turkey, both of which are behaving like interfering mothers-in-law rather than caring mothers, and are only making things more difficult."
"Everyone knows that the resolution of the political problem in Cyprus is an absolute prerequisite and that without it, Turkey's accession is going to run into severe problems."
"We therefore urge that the Union should appoint a European mediator to promote a more dynamic policy and bring this issue to a successful conclusion."
"The debate is closed."
"Welcome"
"I should like to welcome to Parliament two distinguished members of the recently elected Slovak National Council: Mr Peter Weiss, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and now co-chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, and Mr Frantisek Sebej."
"We wish you every success in your work of taking Slovakia forward along the road to membership of the Union."
"Pre-accession strategy"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0397/98 by Mr Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy (COM(98)0551 - C4-0606/98-98/0094(CNS)); -A4-0382/98 by Mr Walter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing an instrument for structural policies for pre-accession (COM(98)0138 - C4-0301/98-98/0091(CNS)); -A4-0388/98 by Lord Tomlinson, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions (COM(98)0168 - C4-0302/98-98/0117(CNS)); -A4-0383/98 by Mr Sonneveld, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the pre-accession period (COM(98)0153 - C4-0244/98-98/0100(CNS))."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Council has left the Hemicycle and I would like this to be recorded in the Minutes."
"I am going to present the report on the proposal for a Council regulation on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy."
"Let me begin, Madam President, by reminding you of a very basic but extremely important fact: enlargement is an essential political project not only within the context of Agenda 2000, but also for the European Union."
"Rather, it is a protracted process that requires joint and shared effort to help these countries meet the requirements set out in the treaties, which were also reflected in theso-called Copenhagen criteria. Basically, they involve consolidating the applicant countries' democratic systems; restructuring their economies, not only to bring them into line with our acquis but also to ensure they operate as market economies; and encouraging good neighbourliness and solidarity between those countries, between each other and with us."
"This requires political will and clear objectives."
"I sincerely hope that the Vienna European Council will reach a political consensus in this regard and, in particular, that it will take account of the inclusive and global nature of this process, without creating new differences and divisions between these countries."
"I also take note of some of the things that the Austrian Presidency has said and that I have interpreted as meaning that Parliament's proposals are being taken on board. Firstly, category 7, which distinguishes pre-accession from the reforms, has been accepted."
"This is something that is positive more from the point of view of clarity rather than transparency, since transparency is not discernible whereas clarity is, and I think that we need to start talking more in terms of clarity in this respect."
"The need to review the financial perspective is also accepted - since the figure of 1.27 % is not set in stone - as is the need for a certain degree of flexibility."
"I believe that this may help the process."
"As regards Parliament's basic contributions to the pre-accession strategy, we think that any pre-accession strategy has to bear in mind the overall political dimension of the process and not simply those individual assessments."
"It also has to take account of dimensions such as those related to aspects of political cooperation and security, which are fundamental."
"We think that it is important for the strategy to reflect and comply with what is set out in our treaties."
"In this respect, we would like to emphasise that the strategy must be developed through the instruments we have, that is, our joint actions and common positions."
"It is important that we ourselves respect the rules we have laid down, without needing to be reminded of them from time to time by the Court of Justice."
"What is more, we have carried out significant work in terms of coordinating the various committees involved with the three basic instruments that are currently in force."
"I must say that the Commission, which put forward the three proposals for a regulation somewhat hastily, has changed its position and amended these giving far greater weight to the PHARE programme."
"In that respect, the Commission should also take Parliament's comments and amendments into account because they better clarify those objectives, particularly as to how the PHARE programme operates. This programme runs the risk of becoming two or three PHARE programmes: one for those countries that have already begun negotiations; one for those that are about to begin them and hope to do so; and one for those countries that are still not involved in the PHARE programme and that are not in the accession process either."
"To conclude, Madam President, I wanted to point out that as a result of the coordination between the various committees in relation to the Hughes procedure, we were able to table amendments aimed at defining the political and economic conditions of the process while stressing the need for cofinancing. The amendments also referred to the need to assess and readjust the aid given within the limits established by the budgetary authority, to decentralisation and the monitoring of the process, to an annual report and to the European Parliament's involvement in the entire development and monitoring process."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has on numerous occasions expressed its clear support for the enlargement process."
"The enormous challenge now facing us is as follows: how can we on the one hand ensure that the applicant states are ready for accession, but on the other hand make the European Union and its structures ready for enlargement?"
"In this context, the pre-accession instrument for structural policies for the applicant states, in short ISPA, represents an important link between countries within and outside the Union by giving support to the applicant countries for urgently needed investment and gradually bringing them into line with the methods of operation and mechanisms of European structural policy."
"The success of the pre-accession strategy will depend decisively on whether all the available instruments, that is to say ISPA, PHARE, pre-accession aid in agriculture and also Interreg are coordinated as far as possible in the context of cross-border cooperation."
"We cannot afford any duplication."
"That would put an unnecessary added burden on the applicant countries, because they have enough on their hands already."
"It must be clearly established, under the coordination regulation and any partnership agreements with the applicant countries, which instrument is to be used, where and how."
"Apart from that, the pre-accession instrument for structural policies must also resolve a fundamental dilemma."
"On the one hand, the applicant countries have an enormous investment need in all possible areas."
"In the field of the environment alone, it is currently estimated that the cost of the necessary investment efforts in the ten countries will come to more than 100 billion euros."
"In that context, the EU financial contributions now being negotiated are little more than a drop in the ocean."
"So the funds must be targeted carefully."
"I think, and the clear vote in the committee endorses that view, that focusing the investment on environmental infrastructure and transport infrastructure should make it considerably easier to fulfil the requirements of the acquis communautaire ."
"We must not fritter away our money."
"Given the slender funds, it is also right, as the Commission has proposed, to provide project-based aid, as in the case of PHARE."
"But that does not mean that the relevant players on the ground in the countries and regions should not be fully involved in these activities."
"Apart from the infrastructure investment, technical assistance will also be given under ISPA."
"It would be wrong to use ISPA to support the general improvement of administrative capacity in the applicant countries, since PHARE does that."
"Given that administrative problems still exist, and given the need to catch up here, it is however necessary for the efficient implementation of the projects to ensure project-related support for the appropriate administrative bodies."
"Focusing also means concentration on a few projects or project packages of relevant size."
"The Commission is right to propose a minimum investment of 5 million euros, provided this is supplemented by the provision that smaller investment sums up to a certain percentage of the resources can be allocated to smaller applicant countries and also in other justified exceptional cases."
"Here we need room for manoeuvre."
"We can also achieve our target by applying the principle of cofinancing."
"This ensures that European funds are used rationally and improves their knock-on effect if they are used in coordination with international financing institutions, such as the European Investment Bank."
"The structural pre-accession instrument keeps being compared with the Cohesion Fund."
"That is correct if we look at the concentration on transport and environmental projects."
"As in the case of the Cohesion Fund, we shall have to ensure a good balance between the two areas."
"The environment must not draw the short straw when we support investment for enlargement."
"But ISPA is more than merely a cloning of the Cohesion Fund."
"It must also help the applicant states become accustomed to the Structural Fund mechanisms."
"That is why we say that as regards implementation and management and any other area where this proves possible, the same provisions must apply as in relation to the Structural Funds and the further development of the Structural Funds currently under discussion."
"The partnership principle must be applied from the outset and as widely as possible."
"With ISPA, the Union is giving a good sign that we are serious about the accession of the Central and Eastern European states."
"Much has already been said in relation to enlargement about time scales, dates and annual figures."
"I think we must define realistic yardsticks here."
"There is no point arousing great expectations that cannot be met, but at the same time we must make it clear that we will use our instruments and that we will indeed provide financial support."
"ISPA represents the financial resources we can make available."
"It helps the applicant states towards self-help, no more and no less."
"In that respect, we welcome the Commission's proposal, subject to the amendments we have tabled, which we hope will be taken into account in the further discussions."
"Madam President, the applicant countries are all busy adapting their farming sectors in order to be ready to join the EU on time."
"Those wishing and intending to join early must demonstrably achieve substantial results in this sector if they are to be able to bring their markets, administrations and institutional infrastructure into line with those of the Union of the 15 without too much difficulty. If the EU is to introduce a new instrument at this point to help the applicant countries in this pre-accession adaptation process, therefore, the help we provide must be strongly geared towards obtaining short-term results."
"We must not make it excessively restrictive, because the field is extremely complex and the situation varies so much from country to country."
"The Commission proposal to allow the applicant countries to choose priority programmes from a list of qualifying policy areas is a fair approach."
"However, the proposal to demand that they draw up a rural development plan by 1 January 2000 incorporating all the programmes they have chosen seems far from fair, in my view."
"Not that such plans are not useful and necessary in themselves, but they cannot be produced at such short notice in a democratic manner and with a sufficiently integrated approach."
"All this does is to introduce unnecessary and even risky complications into this aid programme."
"This is why I have put forward a proposal to the plenary on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture not to make these rural development plans a precondition, but instead to adopt a more pragmatic approach for the time being by funding a number of measures which are universally agreed to be useful."
"We therefore call for a consultative committee to be set up made up of experts from the 15 Member States and the applicant countries."
"Its remit would be twofold."
"First, it would help to identify these useful measures, and at the same time it would ensure that the process of submitting them to the Commission for assessment was kept moving."
"Its recommendations and support would be based on a thorough knowledge of the acquis communautaire and the process of change which the applicant countries are undergoing."
"The services of the committee must be accessible to the administrations of the applicant countries and to the Commission's departments, in close cooperation with the EU representations in the applicant countries."
"This should improve quality and speed up procedures, and thus provide more quantifiable results in the short term."
"To the list of measures proposed by the Commission from which the applicant countries should preferably choose their priorities, the Committee on Agriculture has added the establishment of an agricultural credit system and the accelerated and widespread introduction of book-keeping in farming."
"The committee's text also introduced conditions for a number of the measures, relating to distortion of competition and compatibility with Community legislation."
"I think it is more logical for all these conditions to be listed in Article 6, which deals with the question of compatibility and the conditions to be applied to the aid measures."
"As regards coordination, we must try to ensure that the EU rules for the various aid programmes are as uniform as possible, such as the rules on budgeting and accounting."
"The best possible use must also be made of existing coordination and monitoring structures, and I therefore agree with the amended Commission proposal to make the PHARE committee responsible for this agricultural aid programme too."
"The system of twinning between institutions in certain Member States and those in some of the applicant countries, in the field of veterinary and plant health inspections for example, should also be supported."
"The monitoring committee set up for this system should naturally continue its work under the new arrangement with our support."
"In this way, we can continue to build on the current activities under the PHARE programme."
"Madam President, it is appropriate that we are launching this latest enlargement of the European Union this year, which is also the year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Berlin airlift."
"That was a remarkable international effort in the interests of European peace, stability and democracy."
"It is already very clear that this enlargement of the European Union is going to require the same kind of international effort if we are to see it through successfully."
"It will require unselfishness on the part of the Member States of the European Union and the applicant countries."
"It is clearly a complex and extremely demanding process."
"We have to commit ourselves to the ultimate goal, which is a stable and prosperous Europe."
"Having said that, any solutions to these problems have to be accepted by the people of Europe, both our own voters and the voters in the applicant countries."
"So our solutions have to be practical and acceptable."
"Opinion polls in the European Union at the moment show that people are either indifferent or hostile towards enlargement, so we must actually sell this project, both within the European Union and in the applicant states."
"As well as putting money into infrastructure and the environment we have to think about the people."
"After all, as Galbraith said: 'Money is not superior to democracy'."
"I would like to see more work done on the social dialogue and on developing programmes in these countries to help people affected by economic change."
"In terms of the particular instrument that we are looking at today, as Mr Barón Crespo says, there has to be greater clarity about how this money is spent and how the committees administering this money are set up."
"In view of the latest Commission scandals we must make sure that this project is not tainted by any doubts about how the money is managed."
"Madam President, the regulation on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy is an extremely important step along the road towards the enlargement of the European Union."
"We are currently engaged in a process that considerably changes the Union's image of itself."
"Up to now, we have always regarded ourselves as members of a European economic community, but we are increasingly coming to the conclusion, particularly in our contacts with the applicant countries, that we are primarily a confederation of democratic constitutional states."
"This has also, of course, had an effect on our relations with some of the applicant countries, particularly Slovakia, and we can be grateful that the trouble we took with Slovakia in this respect may well have helped to influence its people to change the way they voted."
"We welcome the fact that the new government there is pursuing a completely different policy from that of its predecessors, and we hope that Slovakia will very rapidly feel the benefits of its prospective membership."
"The Council has taken account of Parliament's desire to monitor the entire process, and we welcome this."
"The way in which the aid is organised is a very instructive example of the Union's political and administrative practices, and there is an important element here of familiarising countries with what future membership of the Union will entail."
"They have to deal with three financing instruments with clearly defined aims."
"They are shown how the Union manages operations, and they also get to know how things are coordinated."
"The emphasis on the responsibility of the Commission is extremely important."
"Article 9, in the Commission's version, is very clear and detailed on this point, and certainly must not be watered down."
"If the Member States are involved in the coordination, it seems logical that they should coordinate their own aid within the same framework."
"I think this is a point worth emphasising."
"In our accession discussions with the UK Presidency, we demanded and secured a procedure which guaranteed that Parliament would be able to examine any changes or additions to the accession strategy."
"We must be very careful here, which is why I do not think it is a good idea specifically to bring this dossier under the second pillar, where we have little say at the moment."
"It is also a good thing that our budgetary powers put us in a strong position, and this is partly why I think that we should not adopt the Swoboda-Titley amendment, Amendment No 15."
"The PPE Group will therefore be voting against the amendments which give the applicant countries a stronger say in the aid process, since we think that the management should ultimately remain in the hands of the European Union."
"After all, it is our taxpayers' money, and we have a responsibility to them."
"The amounts of aid are not particularly high - in fact, you could say that they are surprisingly low."
"It is amazing that we can achieve such a high ideal at such a low cost."
"Madam President, the Liberal Group supports the amendments by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to the Commission's commendable proposal to streamline aid to the applicant countries."
"It is very much in the Union's interests to use the aid funds efficiently, but the budgetary scope is limited and sound management is called for, making alignment with the Member States and the international financial organisations essential."
"We also support the Commission's proposals to decentralise the decision-making powers on micro-projects, and staff and funding must be made available for this."
"We oppose the proposal to make the entire enlargement dossier a foreign policy joint action."
"This sounds like a good idea, given that enlargement is or is claimed to be the main element of the Union's foreign policy, but joint action under the CFSP requires unanimity in the Council and puts the European Parliament in a weaker position."
"More dynamism is required in the preparations for enlargement, as is clear from the Commission's progress report."
"There are considerable differences in the efforts which the Member States have made and the results they have achieved in preparing for enlargement."
"It is primarily up to the applicant countries to do their work properly, but it is clear that the quality and quantity of the aid provided is also a factor."
"It is not the financial target of 1.27 % of GNP but the quality of the preparation for enlargement that must determine the level of aid."
"The Liberal Group is delighted with the objective assessment of all the applicant countries."
"The Commission has rightly said that the two groups are not set in stone, and the efforts they make must be rewarded."
"Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia are all making progress in their own way, but the Czech Republic and Slovenia are proving surprisingly lacklustre."
"We do not have to decide yet on moving certain countries from group II to group I. That will come next year and not just in six months' time either, because we cannot expect the Commission to report every six months."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mr Barón Crespo and the other rapporteurs for their work."
"Obviously some of Mr Barón Crespo's report is the product of the work done in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, and we are very grateful to him for taking on board a whole series of points and suggestions."
"It is clear that the Agenda 2000 enlargement is the great challenge facing this Parliament and the European institutions."
"It is an extraordinary political challenge for countries which only a few years ago could only cherish the dream of Europe, the myth of Europe, a democratic Europe, a Europe of rights and freedom."
"Well, the thought of reducing all this to an accountants' logic of how much money needs to be transferred from one place to another to help those who want to join in this great dream of liberty and democracy, strikes me as pretty simplistic."
"If this is the political challenge our credibility will be riding on in the years ahead, our institutions are certainly not ready to face up to it."
"It is like a car designed for six passengers which already has fifteen people in it, and now we are trying to squeeze twenty-five in."
"The car is in danger of collapsing!"
"That is why, in my opinion, we need to deepen our institutions in this pre-accession strategy. Above all, our dealings with countries which are getting closer to Europe must not revolve around the quantitative problem of economic support, but must substantially involve exporting democratic models and citizens' rights."
"Madam President, those countries are building a constitutional state."
"If there is one thing of value Europe can transmit to them, it is that very concept of the constitutional state, democracy, citizens' rights and the ability to exercise them in every way."
"Madam President, today's debates take us into a crucial phase for defining the next Community financial framework and the guidelines and rules due to govern some of the most important policies and instruments."
"I feel that these debates are taking place in conditions that are completely different from those surrounding the debates that we held on the first and second Delors packages."
"But, in practical terms and to sum up, far off are the times when economic and social cohesion was presented as a point of honour and when we held heated debates about the resources to be earmarked to match our ambitions."
"Undoubtedly, there is an ambition: that of enlargement."
"And there are instruments - yes, there are - to carry out the various proposals made."
"Nonetheless, what is lacking is the money available for the aims and instruments."
"We have no reservations, in principle, about enlargement but we cannot say the same about the approaches chosen by the Commission to carry it out."
"Enlargement will obviously lead to increased expenditure, undoubtedly far greater than the contributions that the candidate countries would be able to make to Community funds. This means that the European Union is going to have to make a choice between two alternatives and only two: either we must make additional financial resources available for enlargement or we will have to reduce expenditure, in other words, cut back our current aims and policies."
"For our part, we are clearly in favour of the former option."
"But this is not the option of the Commission. As it has made strict compliance with the Stability Pact a priority, it has opted for the approach of reducing expenditure."
"This is the objective result of its proposals to maintain a ceiling on financial perspectives at current levels of 1.27 % of Community GNP and the subsequent reduction in that ceiling for the current 15 Member States to 1.13 %, or freezing the structural actions for an enlarged Union at the current 0.46 % of GNP."
"This is now also the result of its proposal to renationalise CAP costs."
"We reject the Commission's option and think that this vital question cannot be put to one side at this moment in time."
"That option would inevitably result in the sacrifice of economic and social cohesion."
"We cannot understand how, for the sake of a new form of solidarity, we can sacrifice the solidarity that happens to be enshrined in the Treaty."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we say that enlargement of the European Union is the greatest challenge since the cold war."
"We say that the accession of our eastern neighbours can bring new stability to Europe."
"The Council representative says that our neighbours await European Union support for tackling their reforms and adopting the acquis communautaire ."
"But let us look at the scale of the financing: it is pocket money and it is shameful."
"The reality is that the applicant countries are virtually paying all the costs of the pre-accession strategies themselves."
"That is why I regard the patronising attitude towards these candidates reflected in the regulation as unacceptable."
"Surely they cannot be treated merely as objects of decision-making."
"They must finally be recognised as partners."
"The least we should do is to give them a say in the coordinating committee."
"The Greens reject the concept of enlargement as a one-way street and call for an enlargement strategy based on partnership."
"Let me add something on the amendments, because in my view the order of the voting list is wrong."
"Mr Barón Crespo will surely accept that our Amendment No 17 to his Amendment No 7 and our Amendment No 19 to his Amendment No 9 represent, in both cases, additions rather than alternatives."
"Madam President, I have some comments to make on this pre-accession strategy, resulting from my experience as rapporteur on the subject of the association of certain CCEE with the education, youth and culture programme."
"Apart from the media sector, these are areas in which the acquis communautaire is modest."
"However, these areas demonstrate certain imbalances from which our strategy suffers."
"To start with, I fully support the rapporteur's point of view."
"Firstly, this pre-accession phase cannot be considered without taking into account the link that exists with certain Community policies and their necessary development."
"Secondly, the goal of coherence and efficiency involves the reaffirmation of the political objectives in the enlargement process."
"This is why it is unfortunate that, in this second phase, the PHARE programme concentrates more on technical operations to the detriment of more political reforms, for example in the social or cultural area."
"Furthermore, in this obstacle course which the applicant countries must tackle, and which is modestly referred to as the adoption of the acquis communautaire , I fear there is a tendency to be content with appearances and to sometimes fail to assess the adherence of these countries to Community policies in terms of values and beliefs."
"This is particularly true in the areas of the environment and transport, which are covered by this new ISPA instrument."
"In this case too, I am not fully convinced that this instrument meets the intended objectives."
"Madam President, we were very pleased to hear from the Commission that good progress has been made in the run-up to the negotiations with the applicant countries on accession to the European Union."
"A number of sections of the acquis have been screened and the results are encouraging, although some countries are slower in moving down the right path."
"However, we are also hearing some less positive noises, and it is becoming clear that adaptation to EU legislation is a much bigger task than was originally thought."
"I endorse the reports before us today, but there are a few points I would like to emphasise."
"A great many demands are being made of the applicant countries, such as respect for fundamental freedoms, which have to be met if they are to join."
"The demand for quality in the adaptations they make must on no account be used as an excuse for delaying their accession."
"The reports show how the Council has been unable to convert the implications of the decision on enlargement into a political strategy."
"Is the political will really there?"
"The negotiators must realise that the former eastern bloc countries have little experience of respecting democracy, human rights and the rights of minorities."
"I am not saying that they should not be blamed for this, but we in the European Parliament have to acknowledge that many of them have made surprisingly rapid progress here."
"We must not set the bar too high for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to join."
"They belong to western Europe, and after a period of Communist domination they are now looking to the countries of western Europe to help them achieve their legitimate aspirations to security and prosperity."
"Joining the stable security structures of the European Union and NATO may help to prevent new conflicts, and the fledgeling democracies of Eastern Europe can be encouraged to develop along particular lines."
"We should seize this opportunity and make every effort to ensure that these countries join as soon as possible."
"If we expect the applicant countries to adapt, the European institutions should set them a good example."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is preparing for the fifth time to welcome new Member States, namely Cyprus and the ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"This enlargement will be much more important than the previous ones."
"Europe of the 15 will become Europe of the 26 and will consist of an additional one million kilometres and a further one hundred million inhabitants."
"In particular, this enlargement towards the East can be taken as a sign of the final destruction of the Iron Curtain, which has divided our continent for nearly half a century."
"Since its creation in 1972, the National Front has constantly fought against this Iron Curtain, which was built by the Communists to enclose the people of Eastern Europe in an enormous concentration camp."
"In his first speech to this Parliament, Jean Marie Le Pen denounced this oppression."
"For many years, although lacking resources, we tried to help our brothers in Eastern Europe but we were then a lone voice."
"In France, all the other parties accepted the situation, including the Communists, of course, whose leader Marchais acclaimed the positive consequences of the people's democracies, their socialist allies, and also the RPR and the UDF, led by Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac who even went so far as to place flowers on the tomb of Lenin, the worst mass murderer of all time."
"Similarly, in 1991, our group was alone in supporting the struggle of the Lithuanians against the Soviet Union and that of the Croats against Yugoslavia."
"At the time, Jacques Delors, the US Government and all the European leaders condemned these people for daring to rise up against communist and federalist regimes."
"These same people now want to see Eastern Europe come under the control of Brussels."
"We are opposed to an enlargement of this kind, as it would cost our countries dearly."
"The Commission has assessed the financial cost at over 500 billion francs between 1999 and 2006."
"This is hardly surprising."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been ruined by over forty years of Communism."
"This cost will be borne in particular by France for it currently receives little from Brussels, to which it pays over 90 billion francs, and it will receive even less in the future."
"The agricultural policy, which has already been drastically reduced, will be cut back even more."
"France's regional aid will be reduced by 20 %."
"Corsica and French Hainaut will no longer be included among the regions assisted under Objective 1."
"However, money is not everything."
"Lech Walesa, when he visited Brussels some years ago, said to me that we in Europe were creating a new Soviet Union."
"He was right."
"Madam President, although Mr Samland has not spoken yet, I would like to concentrate on Lord Tomlinson's report."
"I have to say that it is clear from this whole debate that the idealists are not practical enough and the practical people are not idealistic enough when to comes to dealing with the enlargement problem."
"We have just heard a number of ideas that are extremely idealistic, such as my colleague Mr Oostlander's suggestion that the whole enlargement dossier should be brought under the CFSP and thus handed over to a bunch of quarrelling diplomats."
"I think the CFSP is far too important for this."
"The fund mentioned in the Tomlinson report is a good example of something that is both practical and idealistic."
"It provides aid for countries which is guaranteed by loans and guarantees issued by the Union, and it seems to have been very successful."
"Of course, there are times when it becomes clear that some countries cannot pay, which is when the European Union's guarantees come into play."
"This is an important element."
"The only thing is that it costs money, and this is something the Council in its wisdom failed to consider."
"It thought that the guarantee in itself was enough of an advantage, but there comes a point when you have to pay up."
"Thanks to pressure from the European Parliament, a fund has been created which more or less provides those guarantees itself."
"The fund needs to be supplemented, but it now fortunately appears that we need less than we originally thought and that we can reduce the figure from 10 % to 8 %, which is good news."
"This means that the Union has created an extremely practical instrument which is effective, which can be directly applied in the countries concerned in one way or another through the institutions which they themselves have set up with their central banks, and which is making progress."
"I would even add that we have used this same model in the employment programmes in Europe, where we have also used the combination of guarantees plus loans."
"It really is a very, very good model, much better than all the other things that have been proposed."
"It is also a model that I can prove was purely the result of pressure by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets. If it had been set up as some Member States wanted, in a happy-go-lucky fashion, nothing good would have come out of it, and people would have blamed Parliament for wasting taxpayers' money again."
"But this is not the case."
"I think that we in Parliament need to bear in mind that if the diplomats get it wrong, we shall be the ones who are blamed, not them, and so we need to be both idealistic and practical."
"Madam President, it is vital to focus and coordinate the aid for the applicant countries effectively by means of the three instruments available if we are to achieve maximum possible benefit."
"Fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria is the basis for further development action."
"Efforts must also to be made to coordinate aid to the applicant countries based on cross-border and intergovernmental cooperation in the EU with the Interreg and TACIS programmes, so that the aid itself forms a coordinated whole."
"Aid to improve nuclear safety must also be concentrated in accordance with the PHARE programme."
"In the allocation of agricultural aid to applicant countries we need flexibility and a clear system of prioritization on the basis of partnership agreements."
"Integration with the EU's single market and standards requires a massive amount of development work, which must focus on a policy of quality in foodstuffs production, monitoring, plant and animal health and the environment as a whole, all within the framework of sustainable production."
"We have to prepare for the consequences of structural change in agriculture with an effective, wide-ranging rural policy to create new and varied enterprise action and new jobs, and that is why a high level of education and training is vital when it comes to exploiting the use of the aid given to the applicant countries."
"The partial decentralisation of administration to the applicant countries under the supervision of the Commission is also a step in the right direction."
"We should support the participation of the beneficiary countries, and we must also emphasise the importance of their own involvement in financing investment and discovering sources of funding."
"Madam President, since we are debating a report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs about enlargement, I would like us to turn our attention to a superlatively political issue which has affected people in my country and is very worrying for them."
"It concerns the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union."
"We were extremely disconcerted to see a statement by France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, in which they link the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union with a solution to the Cyprus problem, a thing which bears no relationship to the initial positions adopted by the European Union at a succession of European Councils."
"It is certainly sad to see governments such as those of Mr Dalema, Mr Schröder or Mr Jospin pursuing policies which are worse and which deviate from the commitments made by governments such as those of Mr Berlusconi, Mr Juppé or Mr Kohl."
"In that sense, I would stress that the worst way to solve the Cyprus problem is to say that its solution is a political prerequisite for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, because that would constitute a motive for Turkey, which does not want Cyprus to join, to do nothing about the Cyprus problem even supposing it would otherwise have liked to find a solution to it."
"In that sense, I think it is very important to stand by what Mr van den Broek once said here, and our principle should be that the accession of the Republic of Cyprus must not be held hostage by any other country."
"Madam President, enlargement of the EU to the Central and Eastern European countries brings with it both opportunities and risks, not just for the applicant countries but also for the EU."
"It is particularly important to the agricultural sector that we do not export the destructive system of agricultural policy we have pursued in recent decades to these countries, but that instead we support their existing regional structures, develop them and give them a chance to modernise and become more effective."
"At the same time, we must resist the temptation to set in motion a form of development which, under the heading of 'structural improvement', would give rise to the same kind of negative trends."
"That is why I do not agree with the line taken in the Sonneveld report."
"It says that we must not call for plans for the integrated development of the rural areas."
"This means that he is not in favour of this positive development, which we must promote, but would like to continue pursuing the old system of rationalising structures and thereby destroying jobs and encouraging forms of production that are neither species-friendly nor environment-friendly."
"So we cannot endorse Mr Sonneveld's amendments, not least out of a sense of responsibility for the development of agricultural policy in the EU."
"Madam President, the accession of the countries of Eastern Europe, in particular the great Christian country of Poland and the Hungary of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, is clearly an important and wonderful project."
"I should like to examine the consequences from the agricultural perspective of the Seapared programme."
"The agricultural population of the West will increase by 50 % and our land will be increased by 30 %. Of course it is good to add to one's assets."
"In the Eastern European countries, 25 % of the working population are farmers but this percentage should fall to 6 % as in Western Europe. Agricultural prices are lower with 30 % less for meat, 20 % less for cereals and 15 % less for wheat."
"These countries also have problems of overproduction and plant health and they must adapt to our standards, particularly in terms of food safety."
"The cost is ECU 500 million per year but I am not going to talk about this as it could be resolved if necessary."
"The problem, however, is that these countries must start on the difficult journey which we in the West have already completed."
"Common market organisations must be established, the right to property must be revised, veterinary and plant health changes must be made and in particular farmers must be eliminated."
"This means eliminating Hungarian farmers and producers of Hungarian Tokay, the king of wines and the wine of kings."
"Polish farmers must be eliminated, leading to unemployment."
"Structural Funds would then be needed."
"The West's regrettably hyperproductive agricultural model must be applied with, if you will pardon the expression, concentration camp-like livestock farming, the consequences of which we have seen in the West."
"My greatest fear is that the accession of the countries of Eastern Europe - to which we might agree given the strategic nature of the project - is just a pretext for certain things."
"The first is for the fall in prices in the West, due to the revision of the CAP and to prepare for the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation."
"The second is for the revision - currently underway - of the financing of not only the common agricultural policy but also the whole European Community, with the ensuing problems of France losing too much, Germany losing even more and part of the common agricultural policy being nationalised under the pretext of the cost of the accession of the Eastern European countries."
"Thirdly, the accession of these countries must not be used as an excuse for challenging our CAP."
"It must not be used as a weapon to defeat western farmers by highlighting the fact that their costs are higher and must be reduced."
"Furthermore, it is impossible to do two things at once."
"Can we handle Mercosur, the transatlantic market and all the costs it may incur, and open up to the East at the same time?"
"In conclusion, this is clearly a major strategic project which is soul-stirring but gives the impression of being premature, badly prepared and with many negative elements for the countries of Eastern Europe, which I know want to accede, and many negative elements for us."
"Perhaps discussions should be continued and intermediate stages provided?"
"Everyone knows that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and that perfectionism can be counter-productive."
"Madam President, first let me thank you and the House very warmly for your forbearance in allowing me to deputise for the rapporteur."
"Unfortunately I could not be here at the set time because I had to talk to one of our partners about the conciliation procedure this afternoon."
"That was the problem."
"I must also apologise on behalf of Lord Tomlinson, who is attending an important meeting in the House of Lords today in a different capacity."
"As you know, an important decision is pending there for our British colleagues."
"Let me now turn to Lord Tomlinson's report on amending Regulation 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions."
"As Mr Pronk just pointed out, establishing this Guarantee Fund was a long-standing aim of the European Parliament, because we could not agree to the Member States of the European Union giving guarantees unless these guarantees were safeguarded through a fund, especially in the event of defaults."
"The entire budget stood guarantee in full for any potential defaults."
"So we found it very welcome when this Fund was proposed in 1994 and accepted by the Council, because it created the basis for covering the guarantees in Central and Eastern Europe."
"In the report it has now submitted on the use of these funds and the risks they are designed to cover, the Commission concludes that the target amount of the Fund should be brought down from the existing 10 % to 8 % of outstanding capital liabilities."
"The Commission justifies this on the basis that potentially risky guarantees are situated at a level for which a lower percentage rate of payments into the Fund would suffice."
"By how many per cent are we reducing the rate?"
"In this case, the proposed percentage rate would require an annual maximum amount of EUR 150 million to match up to the present level of lending to non-member countries, which comes to a maximum of about EUR 2.5 billion."
"That would allow the Fund to cover these risks."
"The rapporteur, as also the Committee on Budgets, reached the conclusion that the Commission is right in saying in its report that, according to its estimates and analysis, the total of outstanding loans carrying a more than normal risk was about ECU 1.075 billion as of 1 July 1998."
"You can read that up in the report too, broken down by the various CIS member countries and the countries of Asia and Latin America."
"On that reference date, the Fund had at its disposal ECU 1.186 billion."
"Therefore, in the event that the total amount of loans which could be considered to be carrying a heavy risk were not repaid, the Fund would be able to cope with that loss."
"It would not even be necessary to draw on the amount allocated in the budget for loan endowments during that financial year, which is to say ECU 338 million in 1998."
"In that respect, it was right and sensible to reduce the target amount."
"The rapporteur and the committee endorse the Commission's proposal in that respect."
"We have, however, tabled two amendments on which we would like to hear the Commission's position before the vote on this report."
"One calls on the Commission to submit a regular report to us so that we can re-evaluate the trend in the utilisation of the credits and the funds."
"I think this is the point on which we differ least."
"Here the Commission will endorse our view."
"It is Amendment No 2."
"But I would like the Commission to confirm this."
"Far more important, however, is Amendment No 1."
"Who is to manage the Fund?"
"Here we take an entirely different view."
"I tend to agree more with Mr Pronk than with the Commission."
"The Commission would like to transfer the management of the Fund from the European Investment Bank to its own administrative staff."
"We believe such a step would be quite wrong."
"In his explanatory statement, the rapporteur has once again pointed out that he considers it unlikely that European Union officials would be better able to evaluate the risks in granting loans than a bank, which has to prove itself at bank level and has to evaluate the quality of the risks as part of its usual banking business before deciding to grant loans."
"So we want to maintain the existing article."
"That would mean adopting Amendment No 1."
"The Commission is asked to delete the point in its proposal relating to the financial management of the Fund."
"We would like the Commission to make a statement on this."
"As proposed by the rapporteur, I would like to say the following: if the Commission does not accept these two amendments, we will call for the report to be referred back to committee, because we cannot in fact support it if the Commission does not accommodate us on this point."
"Madam President, enlargement of the EU with the accession of the Central and Eastern European states and Cyprus is not just a project starting with the new century, it is also a task for that century."
"And a project of this scale calls for an exceptional effort on the part of all concerned."
"Indeed, everyone has now realised that this primarily means the applicant states."
"But in the light of the real differences between us and the applicant states, for instance in the economic and social field, I continue to believe that in general the European Union is still not making enough efforts to meet this challenge, not least in financial terms."
"But be that as it may."
"In the given circumstances, I believe the Commission has nonetheless submitted proposals that are for the most part viable and at least still give us a chance to master this important process of accession to the European Union and give it a positive shape."
"I would like to address one detail."
"I believe it is more necessary now than in past enlargements to familiarise the public administrations in the applicant states with the aims and procedures of the acquis communautaire at all levels- not just at the highest level, where this is certainly already the case, but also at lower levels."
"In my view, we are still underestimating the background situation of the majority of these states, namely a dictatorship system with the corresponding type of administration."
"Moreover, we all too often forget that the same people are still working in the lower echelons of this administration, who are of course now endeavouring to work under the new system."
"But we should gear parts of our pre-accession aid much more specifically than in the past towards retraining the administration."
"On the other hand, it is probably less necessary now for western Europe to finance new studies."
"I believe it is enough to analyse what we already have in that respect."
"Let me come back to our task for the new century."
"We should approach the interests not only of the applicant states but of course our own interests too in the most fair and balanced manner."
"But above all, as European democrats we should also be thankful that we can take part in this historic process."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow on from Mr Botz's last comment."
"Indeed we do not need to carry out any more feasibility studies; instead we need operational resources, and I believe that is the road the Commission has been pursuing for some time."
"We are quite prepared to support the Commission in terms of concentrating more on that approach."
"Setting infrastructure and the environment and the support measures for supervisory staff and investment financing as its objectives is the right starting-point, as is the strong emphasis on promoting democracy and the rule of law and viable administrative structures, together with a sensible judicial system."
"But we must now spend these funds rapidly and unbureaucratically, so that they can make a fairly rapid impact."
"We are facing a difficult task, namely how to bring about an economic and political balance on a continent that was once mercilessly divided both economically and politically."
"Our major task in connection with this process of rapprochement must be to fuse the two parts together again."
"Here we must also take a look at ourselves and remember something we tend forget: that what we represent as the national interest can in fact be assimilated with the interest of the Community."
"When we look at the opposition between national interests, which are often considered in a short-sighted way, we may see short-term difficulties here and there, but in truth we want enlargement because it is also to our advantage, and not just to the advantage of the applicant countries."
"If we realise this, if we really define our interests in the political, security and economic areas, then we will also be in a position to muster the ability to compromise and achieve the balance that we need if we are to make progress here."
"One thing is clear: until now we have enjoyed the benefits of strengthening trade relations between Central and Eastern Europe on the one side and the European Union on the other."
"Our citizens may have gained the impression that up to now all this has simply cost a lot of money; but the reality is that we have actually earned more than we have spent on these countries, simply because of the imbalance in trade relations."
"I believe we should make that clear to our people too if we are to mobilise the necessary political support for this accession process."
"We must also take the time factor into account, since it is an important factor if we want the citizens of the applicant countries to continue giving their support."
"That means the programmes have to be of a high quality."
"Mrs Schroedter, I am delighted to hear you say that shamefully little money is being spent!"
"I would cordially ask you to invite your Foreign Minister and your Chancellor to take your words to heart, so that we can achieve a better policy here!"
"Madam President, the reports on 'Agenda 2000' that the various committees are presenting hang together like spider's web."
"But acceptance of the proposed reforms must be wholly subject to maintenance of the Community policies contributing to cohesion between the Fifteen and to measures to facilitate the accession of the applicant countries."
"As regards relations ahead of the pre-accession strategy, we agree with the rapporteur and with those who assert that the criteria defined at Copenhagen must be respected: the constitutional state, democracy, existence of a market economy, respect for the acquis communautaire ."
"We take the view that the new accessions represent a historic opportunity to reconcile our continent with its past and that they are needed to define the Europe of the future."
"But the Commission's proposals are prudent and pragmatic as they have to take account of the strong divergencies between the states, divergencies which underline what the Alleanza Nazionale has long maintained: that a great Europe is one where political union is the precursor of economic union."
"Political union should be and should have been refined before initiating the pre-accession negotiations, so that the new states could actually be presented with a precise and well-defined framework for the whole."
"So the proposal lacks a political introduction, which we think is necessary and which would have buttressed the central problem that the new accessions raise - the future financing of Europe."
"Plus we deplore the fact that the opening presented to the six states does not respond to precise political choices, and we suspect that it may be just an accounting device to make it possible to achieve the enlargement while maintaining the Community budget on the current base of 1.27 % of gross domestic product until 2006."
"To be complete, the construction of Europe must unite all its peoples."
"But we must point out, with some regret, that the institutional reforms, the future financing of the budget and other problems are still waiting in the wings, while there is a need for unambiguous political will on the part of all the governments to handle European affairs politically and not as a purely economic and financial negotiation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I detect in our joint debate a discrepancy between a pre-accession strategy that is admirable and full of ambition and an Agenda 2000 that should prepare the Union for welcoming the applicant countries and in fact involves the necessary alignment of our common policies."
"With regard to the pre-accession strategy that I wish to discuss this morning, I feel that we desperately need to take an overview of this. This overview would show that the enlargement for which we are preparing is not just a simple case of adding together two units."
"The EU must remind the applicant countries of this."
"We cannot engage in a bilateral process with each Member State."
"We must assess the overall impact of this strategy."
"Less than a year after the adoption of a list of applicant countries that the EU could initially integrate, we now see that the map has already changed."
"Malta has resubmitted its application, the Commission is envisaging the accession of Turkey under new conditions and there is a renewed possibility of two Baltic applicants being accepted."
"More than ever it seems that the European Conference is essential, in its role as a forum for producing this overview, and I feel we must return to this."
"I cannot stand to see this gap between the global and inclusive process that we have always wanted and the absence of an overview."
"We need to debate and consider the frontiers of the Union, the political objectives of the Union, the methods for decision-making and governing with more than 15 countries, and the methods for defending this body and for making its voice heard in world affairs."
"The amendments proposed by Mr Barón Crespo are in line with this and I fully support them."
"However, we must all be careful: if the devil is in the details, we are in danger of becoming blind to these details sometimes."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, our agenda this morning has been organised to take account of the formal sitting."
"That is why the votes are taking place now, and also why we unfortunately cannot complete our debate this morning, as we could have done if we had held the votes at midday."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome a delegation from the National Assembly of Mauritania who have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"This delegation is led by the Speaker, Mr Sid'ahmed Ould Baba, and I would point out that this is the second interparliamentary meeting with the relevant delegation of the European Parliament."
"Our relations are based on friendship, cooperation and partnership, and I very much hope that this second meeting will enable us to strengthen these relations further."
"Thank you, and a warm welcome to Strasbourg."
"(Applause)"
"VOTES"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I should like to ask you to join me in welcoming into the public gallery Helga Stevens, from the European Union for the deaf, who is observing this vote on behalf of the 500 000 profoundly deaf people within the European Union, as we vote to reaffirm this Parliament's support for the official recognition of their language - sign language - in every Member State of this European Union."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I do not know whether it is our machines that cannot keep up with Scottish technology or whether you are going too fast for the machines but there is a whole row here that is not working properly."
"I think it is probably something to do with the Liberals."
"Mr Watson - a good Scot - you will have kept up, I am sure."
"Mr President, I think we need to get away from the destructive tribalism of your last comment."
"We voted on 12 amendments with one vote."
"I should like to have your ruling as to whether that counts as 12 roll call votes or not."
"(Laughter)"
"It is a productivity deal and I am afraid it is one move of the finger, one count."
"Welcome"
"Mr President, as chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Japan, I would like to point out that an important delegation from the Japanese Diet is present."
"They have travelled a long way and I hope that we can give them a warm welcome."
"(Sustained applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Pompidou."
"In fact I was going to leave it to the President to make the greeting but I shall do so with pleasure myself."
"It gives me great pleasure to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from the Japanese Diet, led by Mr Taro Nakayama."
"This is the 19th meeting between our respective delegations and, on behalf of the European Parliament, I wish to welcome them officially to this working session of Parliament and wish them every success on their visit."
"(The sitting was suspended for a formal sitting and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"VOTES (continuation)"
"Mr President, it is an unmitigated disaster that Members have only received this amendment at 10 a.m."
"I wonder what the Liberals are up to?"
"The wording in the Swedish text says 'shorter working hours', but the Liberals would prefer it to be 'flexible working hours'."
"Low inflation is mentioned, but not in the translation, which is absolutely terrible!"
"I was, of course, opposed to this proposal, which was fine in the original, so please can we have the original version back!"
"Something also has to be done about the translation!"
"You are quite right."
"The one safeguard we have is that the language services always ensure that the amendments correspond to the original version."
"But there is a problem in getting amendments to people on time."
"Amendment No 2"
"Mr President, after consultation with the various groups, I should like to make two small, but to some people important, changes to Amendment No 2."
"In the first section, 'European investment programme' should be changed to 'European investment strategy' and 'develop' to 'extend'."
"This last change is mainly a point of accuracy."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Welcome"
"Before we move on to the next vote, I have great pleasure in welcoming to the official gallery a delegation from the South African National Assembly led by Mrs Frene Ginwala, Speaker of the National Assembly and leader of the South African delegation, who are with us for their fourth interparliamentary meeting with the relevant European Parliament delegation."
"This is an historic moment in the relations between South Africa and the European Union: negotiations are currently under way to conclude a trade, development and cooperation agreement, and we hope that they will be concluded successfully shortly."
"Our respective assemblies will then be consulted on this agreement, which will help to bring the countries and the peoples which we represent closer together."
"I wish the South African delegation every success and a pleasant stay during their visit to Strasbourg."
"(Applause)"
"VOTES (continuation)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Green Group and pursuant to Rule 129 I must ask for this report to be referred back to committee."
"During yesterday's debate, Mr Sainjon put forward arguments justifying this request."
"Unfortunately he cannot be present today but as I fully agree with him I am repeating his proposal."
"Both arguments relate to current events."
"Firstly, we are actually voting on a Commission communication that we know is no longer applicable."
"We are in fact going to adopt a report which Mrs Mann has had the goodness to adapt in accordance with the new political situation."
"The current context involves a Transatlantic Economic Partnership dealt with in a Commission/Council agreement and, more recently, in fact just a week last Monday, in a Council agreement on an action plan which we have never seen."
"We received a copy of this in English in the Committee on External Economic Relations but Parliament has never been able to debate this text."
"This is the first current event which means that we risk voting on a text which is out of date in terms of the policy and the issues and which, more seriously perhaps, risks causing confusion and even contradiction in Parliament."
"This would not be good for this House."
"In conclusion, the second current event is the American position on bananas."
"Everyone is aware of this situation so I will not go into it."
"I believe that the context in which we debated this in committee, and even yesterday, has changed."
"We cannot be conciliatory towards a discussion partner who is being arrogant."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry but the proposal from the Greens is absurd."
"Just listen a moment!"
"That is no way to achieve what you want."
"If you want Parliament's voice to be heard, both in the Council and in the Commission and also by the Americans, you will have to state your position today."
"The next summit between the United States and Europe will take place in early December and this particular report will be discussed there too."
"That means that you will achieve nothing at all by preventing Parliament from stating its position on it today."
"Why do you not just look at the realities!"
"After all, the political reality outside our doors does not depend on the position of the Greens!"
"(Heckling and applause) We have adapted everything."
"We are not pronouncing on an old report!"
"I have specifically included all the Council's new decisions."
"I have pointed out that Parliament would like to have a new report."
"I have pointed out that these reports should go to all the committees."
"The Commission has agreed, the Council has indicated that it too would take note of this."
"That is all you can do."
"That is the way to ensure that Parliament and the committees can reconsider precisely that decision at a future date."
"If you refer the report back to committee, you will be depriving us of any chance of making a political statement."
"I would ask my colleagues in this House to agree that we vote on it today, and that we also vote in favour."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Radical Alliance agrees totally with the request submitted by the Green Group and Mr Lannoye, and we also agree with the reasons put forward."
"We can give an excellent incidental reason, namely the banana affair."
"The European Banana Market Organisation uses the basic rules of our Community to ensure both internal and external solidarity, particularly with regard to the ACP States. We are being subjected in this case to an American diktat that has not yet received an appropriate European response."
"This is our circumstantial reason."
"However, we also have more general substantive reasons and, without wanting to offend Mrs Mann with regard to her excellent work, we do not share all her assumptions, particularly not those contained in the initial recitals of the draft resolution, which assert the similarity of the models of society on each side of the Atlantic."
"On the contrary, we believe that these models are different and that the banana affair perfectly illustrates the difference between one model of society based on rules of liberalism and competition and another model based on values of humanism and solidarity."
"Mr President, this will not become the rule here in Parliament, but in this case the European People's Party entirely agrees with the Social Democrat rapporteur."
"We have held a very detailed discussion, which has taken full account of relations between the USA and the European Union."
"The report makes some very critical comments about American policy."
"If all these critical comments on American behaviour are to find a hearing, the report must be adopted now, and not at a time when there is no chance of our view being heard."
"I am therefore against the ideological and hyper-critical attitude of the Greens, and ask for this motion to be rejected."
"(Parliament decided against referral back to committee)"
"Mr President, I found it difficult to understand the translation of the amendment from the Liberal Group in the earlier work and it is even harder to understand Amendment No 1 from the UPE Group."
"In the Swedish version it has been left out altogether."
"I apologise to Mr Pasty for my incomprehension."
"That may not necessarily be the translation."
"Mr President, I believe you made a remark which I consider to be rather personal."
"In reply to Mrs Thors, you indicated that the stupidity of Amendment No 1 might not just be a result of the translation but that it was perhaps intrinsically idiotic or stupid."
"My conscience has led me to reread this amendment which simply says that, in the negotiations with the United States, we must respect the acquis communautaire ."
"I will let you and this House judge whether there is anything stupid in this amendment."
"Mr President, our group wholeheartedly supports the resolution on sign language, and we call for our policy on the deaf to pursue two objectives."
"First and foremost of these is greater accessibility, by which we mean equal access to education and public services and equal opportunities to take part in public meetings and hearings."
"There are about half a million deaf people in the European Union."
"By improving accessibility for the deaf, we are strengthening democracy."
"Secondly, we call for better integration for deaf people, and there are five things that will help us to achieve this."
"First and most important is better training for sign language interpreters."
"Integration for the deaf is perfectly possible through the use of interpreters, so we need to provide adequate training opportunities for those who wish to learn sign language."
"It will be difficult to achieve general recognition for sign language."
"In Sweden, Denmark and Finland, sign language is already recognised in education, and the other Member States should follow suit here."
"We also need recognition for sign language in contacts with the public authorities and in the fields of employment and culture, perhaps following the United States' example."
"We must also ensure that the deaf have equal access to information."
"They have the same rights as those who can hear, but while this is obviously the case in the United States, it is often not so here in the Union."
"Another glaring problem is the incompatibility of text telephone systems."
"In my country, Flanders, alone we have at least three different systems that are not compatible, which gives you a good idea of the scale of the problem throughout Europe."
"This is completely unacceptable in the single market."
"There are no absolute standards for these communication systems, which is why deaf people currently tend to use faxes, though this is not two-way communication."
"They are now investigating possibilities using the Internet, which offers them huge opportunities to improve communication with those who can hear."
"Here again, the question is whether all chat systems are compatible and whether everyone can afford to buy the necessary equipment."
"In conclusion, I should like to stress the importance of multimedia applications and of ensuring that the deaf are fully involved in their development."
"One final point: the Community has few powers in these areas, but I think that we in Parliament, as representatives of the people of Europe, have a duty to speak up on behalf of half a million deaf people."
"The incompatibility of the text telephone systems is clearly an internal market problem, so I hope we can rely on the Commission to come up with some proposals here."
"In any case, I hope that this resolution has more of an impact on the Member States than was the case with our resolution of ten years ago."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on an urgently needed report."
"The proposed directive relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat is of great importance in enabling people with reduced mobility to lead fuller lives, as well as making it easier for them to use public transport."
"We are pleased to note that to a large extent the report takes account of the needs of people with reduced mobility, so as to make it possible for them to travel in the types of vehicle covered by the directive."
"The rights of people with reduced mobility must come before the private interests of bus manufacturers."
"There should be a Union-wide coordinated approach to dealing with the issue, since to allow Member States to decide matters for themselves, or to leave it to the market, would only worsen the chances of people with reduced mobility having their needs met."
"Although we voted for the report, we are still critical - for the reasons expressed in our previous explanation of vote - of the form of legislation it represents."
"In the different areas, legislation should be the principal and guiding mechanism, while technical specifications at profession level should be left to professional bodies and be applied through special regulations."
"Mr Murphy's report is topical in dealing with what constitutes one of the most difficult problems for the European Union and the internal market."
"The free movement of goods presupposes either the establishment of a minimum requirement, which applies to all Member States, or that Member States mutually agree to approve each other's goods."
"In both cases, Member States with high minimum requirements can be forced to lower them."
"In our view, the minimum requirement recommended by Mr Murphy in his report is so wide that there would be no serious risk of Member States having to lower their own minimum requirements."
"Neither does the report make any mention of compelling Member States to change their current regulations to make buses that are now in service undergo alterations."
"Instead, the report recommends that vehicles which comply with the requirements contained in the report would automatically be acceptable in all Member States."
"We have decided to vote for the report for the above reasons."
"It should be a foregone conclusion that all Member States, manufacturers and operators have a duty to ensure passenger and traffic safety and that the special needs of disabled people are met."
"Any loophole in the laws of Member States should be rectified at national level."
"There is no need for an EU directive to legislate on total harmonisation or detailed specifications relating to the construction of buses, for example the width of seats, height of boarding platforms, provision of palm-operated buttons, or size and location of exit signs."
"Furthermore, it is absurd for MEPs to have to adopt a position on 143 pages of technical data, drawings, and so on. It is evident in both the Commission communication and the report that it is the existence of protectionist measures with regard to trade in buses within the internal market which is the prime concern and is the reason for both the report and the Commission's proposal."
"I voted against the report for the above reasons."
"I would have preferred the Commission to have viewed the issue from the standpoint of passenger and traffic safety and with the problems of disabled people in mind, and to have put forward a recommendation that would have improved safety and accessibility."
"In our explanation of vote, we should like to stress that we still think that the design of the euro coins should take into consideration the needs of blind and elderly people."
"As regards the proposal to introduce a 100 euro coin, we have decided to bow to the opinion of the PSE Group, although for our part we view the issue in a more neutral light."
"This report gives me an opportunity to draw attention to a problem about which the public is becoming increasingly concerned: the proliferation of euro coins."
"In addition to the euro coins minted by each of the 11 Member States in the euro zone, it seems that states that have a monetary agreement with one of the Member States in the euro zone are requesting that they be allowed to mint euros with national faces."
"This request is being made by San Marino and the Vatican City in Italy and by Monaco in France."
"I must say that this request is absurd."
"Not only would it mean that countries which are not part of the euro zone and which do not therefore have to fulfil the very strict obligations for this would have the right to issue euros, but it would also contribute, if accepted, to the proliferation of euro coins. This would add to the public's confusion, which will be widespread anyway given the numerous commemorative coins that will undoubtedly be issued around 2002 to celebrate the advent of the euro."
"In addition, as the Prime Minister of France, Lionel Jospin, has already indicated, authorising the Vatican to mint euros with an image of the Pope on the national face would risk causing constitutional problems in countries where there is a clear separation of Church and State."
"For all these reasons, the issue of euro coins must be strictly limited and the three states indicated must consequently be refused the right to mint euro coins."
"The Council's proposal amending the Regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation has two aims. The first is to alter the weight of the 50 cent coin in order to meet the requirements of vending machines, and the second is to change the definition of the edge of the 50 and 10 cent coins, at the request of the European Blind Union, to facilitate their use."
"We agree to these substantive changes as we believe they are practical. On the one hand, they are intended to facilitate the daily life of the visually impaired and, on the other, they should prevent fraud."
"However, we must consider the consequences in terms of cost of these last-minute changes, given that production has already started."
"It is rather curious, not to say unacceptable, that these changes have been made at the last moment when the minting of the coins has already begun, at the end of a full-scale campaign to promote the euro throughout Europe and after many technical studies and numerous hearings of experts!"
"Once again the cart has been put before the horse."
"It is saddening that disabled people were not taken into account earlier, while the practical aspects are still not fully settled!"
"The Council, Commission and Parliament should all share responsibility for this."
"A little more precision in the first place would obviously have helped the introduction of the euro."
"High rates of unemployment and the falling demand for labour are fixed variables preventing our Union's social policies from coming into line."
"If we introduce factors like the future economic and monetary union, the ageing of the population or the future enlargement to the CEECs into the analysis, the paradigm gets even more complicated."
"The Union's philosophy on policies for employment and mobility and on differentiating work typologies must be based on three types of approach: the first is optimising action; the second relates to financial support; and the third to the legislation which should underpin the new social action programme."
"Like the rapporteur, we must first deplore the way the Commission keeps insisting on resorting to the use of instruments that are not legally enforceable, when, in our view, in areas such as the organisation of work, workers' individual and collective rights and social measures regulating the free-market economy, rules should continue to take the form of directives."
"In our view the Commission would be able to act more vigorously if it included a series of provisions in the new social programme."
"The most important of these would be reducing the fiscal pressure on small companies and raising employees' wages through profit-sharing schemes, practical measures which should certainly be accompanied by initiatives to define the future of social dialogue precisely, and promote the adoption of a charter of fundamental social rights, also extending it to those partner countries which have not yet ratified it."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, both as regards the presentation and contents of the proposals contained in the report."
"The new Social Action Programme is very important in the Union's development of its social and labour market policies."
"The Commission's proposals are basically sound, but they would have been noticeably improved by the inclusion of the committee's amendments."
"We agree with the proposals put forward in the report, in particular as regards the following: a clearer focus on the social dialogue, a move to incorporate provisions relating to individual rights in the social sector in the Treaty, an action programme against discrimination, legislation on sexual harassment, the need for stress to be included in legislation on the protection of employees, and their right to information and representation in the workplace."
"The report warrants a number of amendments which constitute urgent matters in themselves. However, it would be better to deal with them in another report that is more relevant to the areas they touch on."
"We are not voting in favour of the Hughes report on the Social Action Programme 1998-2000, since it contains proposals for directives on workers' individual and collective rights and the social regime which will disregard the Danish system of agreements."
"We are going to vote against the report, because we do not think that it is appropriate to legislate at EU level on matters relating to the organisation of work and workers' individual and collective rights."
"Labour rights and related issues should, in the main, fall to the competence of individual countries."
"We agree with many of the rapporteur's proposals to improve the new Social Action Programme, for example on promoting worker involvement in company decision-making and strengthening the rights of employees' representatives, as well as the proposal to promote civil dialogue - we think that biannual forums are inadequate."
"However, we do not agree that directives are an appropriate form of legislation in areas such as the organisation of work and workers' individual and collective rights. Instead, we think that negotiated agreements between the partners in the labour market are a workmanlike and appropriate way to achieve success in this area."
"We also have reservations as regards legally binding legislation on sexual harassment."
"We have therefore decided to abstain in the final vote."
"The Social Action Programme, commonly known in Brussels jargon as the 'SAP', was submitted for our approval today. The French abbreviation is 'PAS' and this reminds us of unfortunate recent events in France when the French National Assembly considered the now notorious PACS - ' Pacte Civil de Solidarité', which is a legal framework for two cohabiting people."
"We have voted against this SAP."
"There are several simple reasons for this, and they basically relate to our very conception of social Europe and what this must be."
"Social Europe is not the Europe of the devotees of Maastricht and Amsterdam."
"It is not the Europe of the general minimum income or of voting rights for immigrants."
"It is not the Europe of no borders and company relocations."
"It is not the Europe of ultra-liberals, free traders and internationalists."
"Social Europe is first and foremost the Europe of homelands, national preference and social welfare."
"As a tool for social peace, social welfare must have the nation as a development framework and must come under the responsibility of each state."
"Unlike the rapporteur, we believe that, in the context of the internal market, social matters must require unanimous approval by the Member States."
"Decisions taken on social matters have such extensive effects on all labour relations and on the lives of our citizens that all decisions taken by a qualified majority, where these are compulsory and therefore imposed on all the Member States, are dangerous for all citizens, whether working or unemployed."
"We have therefore voted against this report which is dangerous in addition to being demagogic."
"Prioritising employment is a positive move."
"EMU, the single currency and a permanent anti-inflation policy make it more difficult to increase employment."
"The Social Action Programme should preferably be a non-binding instrument for analysing problems that lead to social exclusion, poverty, unemployment and discrimination."
"Legislation on social issues, individual rights and so on should preferably be carried out by Member States and not through EU Treaty provisions."
"In paragraph 2 of the report, Parliament expresses its disappointment that the Commission is increasingly resorting to the use of regulatory instruments in the field of labour legislation."
"Instead, the report establishes that 'in areas such as the organisation of work, workers' individual and collective rights... rules should take the form of directives...'"
"I am wholly in agreement with the report as regards the importance of basic labour rights legislation."
"However, I should like to point out that this is mainly a matter of national concern, and EU competence only extends to areas involving the organisation of labour and the working environment."
"In other areas, it is important to recognise Member States' cultural differences."
"For example, Sweden does not have a legal minimum wage; the issue is decided through collective bargaining and agreement."
"I am in favour of an EU directive on minimum standards in the areas of organisation of labour and the working environment."
"In many Member States, it will enable workers and their representatives to enhance their working environment."
"However, I have serious reservations about an EU directive in the field of labour legislation."
"It is also very important to encourage the European social partners to commit themselves to a binding agreement."
"Agreement has shown itself to be the most effective way of achieving a functioning labour market."
"Getting the social partners to take greater responsibility for reaching agreement considerably strengthens the labour market."
"There should be no recourse to legislation by Parliament until the social partners have articulated the causes of their disagreement."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on an urgently needed report."
"The report should be praised for the way in which it undertakes the adjustments to the employment guidelines that are needed in order to make them more effective."
"In particular, we should like to stress the importance of ensuring that employment is placed within the context of European macroeconomic policy."
"The scope of the report in this respect is to be commended, and goes in the right direction for achieving a dynamic employment policy within the framework of the European labour market, as the predominantly social democrat Council acknowledges."
"Amendment No 1 on the need to prevent unfair tax competition is particularly interesting from Sweden's point of view, on account of the recent high-profile transfer of profits by Pharmacia and Upjohn to Luxembourg."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the report on the employment guidelines for 1999."
"We firmly support the new form of European cooperation on employment."
"Exchanges of experience and annual assessments for the Member States will hopefully bring results in the form of more people moving into work."
"We are also pleased that the emphasis has been placed on continuity in relation to the employment guidelines for 1998."
"The initiatives which are under way need time to operate in practice."
"Equal treatment is the area in which the Member States have lagged most behind in 1998."
"It is therefore right that it should be given greater prominence in the guidelines for 1999."
"We need to have some quantitative objectives in terms of equal treatment."
"We do not support the call made in paragraph 2 for VAT to be reduced."
"The van Velzen report contains a long series of parameters designed to guide the Member States' employment policy in 1999 which we are unable to support."
"It is clear from the report that an important part of the European Union's drive towards integration is to ensure social convergence."
"At the same time, it stresses the importance of the Member States acting in accordance with the Stability Pact."
"In principle, we do not believe that social and labour market policy should be a matter for the Union."
"It should be left to the individual Member States to determine the guidelines for these policy sectors on a sovereign basis."
"The power to regulate should therefore remain at national level, and as close to individual citizens as possible."
"The report stresses the need to raise the level of qualifications in the workforce and to mainstream equal treatment policy and promote policy initiatives in favour of the disabled."
"It is important to give priority to these sectors, not least because there is still a large group of women who, despite the fact that they do the same work as their male colleagues, are paid less for it."
"However, it is problematic for the EU to combine these initiatives with its attempt to establish common European guidelines for Member States' employment policies and to encourage social convergence in the EU."
"We believe it is crucial for the EU system to respect the different social and labour market policy traditions in the Member States."
"Establishing social convergence is therefore a step in the wrong direction, because for a number of countries, many of the Commission's proposals will in the longer term result in a gradual dismantling of their social security systems, thereby actually worsening the situation of the disabled and other vulnerable groups in society."
"Thus in the Commission's communication dated 14 October 1998 - COM(98)574 - it is emphasised that, in order to promote employment, the Member States should set a target for 'reducing the overall tax burden and, where appropriate, a target for gradually reducing the fiscal pressure on labour and non-wage labour costs'."
"Combined with the monetary policy contained in the Pact on Growth and Stability and the requirements for Member States' monetary and financial policy, we believe that this economic strategy will ultimately result in the Danish social policy model being put under pressure."
"I welcome the fact that our rapporteur has raised the question of coordinating economic policies and, in particular, of using tax harmonisation as one of the main weapons in the fight against unemployment."
"I am also delighted that he has emphasised the need to develop entrepreneurial spirit, and that he has stressed the need for better targeted use of the Structural Funds in order to promote employment."
"On the other hand, it would have been better if a number of unrealistic and economically questionable solutions had not been put forward."
"As a result, I am concerned by our rapporteur's persistence in asking, on several occasions, that working time be reduced by means of a centralised procedure."
"There is nothing to stop a company appealing for greater flexibility in working time whenever the opportunity presents itself."
"But to want this decision to be taken, at all costs, at the highest level of our European institutions would be pure nonsense."
"There is another proposal that strikes me as particularly worrying: some sort of European 'New Deal' that involves using the currency reserves of the National Central Banks to stimulate investment!"
"Without going as far as debating the validity of a Keynesian upturn, such a measure would only accelerate the fall in the dollar and, in doing so, would work against recovery in Europe."
"I do not believe that this is what we wish to achieve."
"This report on the proposed guidelines for Member States' employment policies for 1999 contains a series of recommendations relating to Member States' action plans."
"We are all keen that Member States should cooperate and coordinate their strategies in order to create lasting employment."
"Sometimes it is justifiable to 'urge on' Member States, but there are also times when Parliament wants to go too far."
"Amongst other things, the proposal in paragraph 6 of Mr van Velzen's report, concerning a European Pact that should include the coordination of economic and financial policy, goes too far in our view."
"Despite the fact that we are voting against this paragraph and have abstained on another, we are still going to vote in favour of the report as a whole, because it encourages job creation."
"The van Velzen report contains some very sensible proposals on employment policy."
"However, I think it would be useful to look more towards tax reliefs and less towards aid measures."
"But I have no sympathy at all for giving unilateral support to women in paid employment, while at the same time discriminating against women who bring up their children themselves."
"It is high time we recognised that bringing up children in the family is a real and highly-qualified job and remunerate it accordingly."
"The relevant studies show that a clear majority of mothers want to bring up their children themselves but are forced by material pressures to take a paid job, which means they then have to put their children into child care establishments."
"The job of bringing up children within the family deserves to be fully recognised as such."
"After all - to put it in business management terms - it produces valuable human capital."
"I will vote in favour of the van Velzen report."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament should have been clearer about how much macroeconomic manoeuvre was allowed to stimulate growth, particularly as Parliament maintains, with the French and German Governments, that there is a need for a fresh cut in interest rates in countries in the euro zone."
"Parliament also supports the requests from the Head of the Italian Government that the vice-like grip of the Dublin Stability Pact be loosened, particularly to promote investment."
"The report should have placed greater emphasis on the urgent need for major developments in infrastructure by setting time limits and suggesting ways of financing them, for example by means of a major European loan."
"We fear that this idea, which has been raised many times, might remain only on paper and might not become a reality. There is also cause for concern that it has not fulfilled the desired objectives - namely job creation - as it has been diluted over time and has not reached significant critical financial mass."
"Lastly, the plea for a reduction in working time is rather feeble as the objectives do not provide figures or dates and the 35 hour week is never clearly stated."
"More serious still is the wording of paragraph 19, which links flexibility to a reduction in working hours."
"As everyone knows, flexibility does not create jobs but, on the contrary, destroys them. Flexibility is a characteristic of jobs that do not have normal status and leads to an increase in part-time work and to job insecurity."
"I will therefore vote against this paragraph."
"Whilst the European Union does not have a true founding treaty for a social Europe, whilst employment, according to the Amsterdam Treaty, still falls under national jurisdiction and whilst European initiatives are restricted by the Stability Pact, there is a real danger that Europe will not be capable of taking decisive action that may help reduce mass unemployment."
"So, if current growth is a bonus, it must be consolidated, and if we assume that it will continue at the rate recorded, it would take decades to substantially reduce the mass unemployment we are currently experiencing."
"Finally, what can we say about full employment, other than that it is still the only valid objective for supporters of a European social model!"
"I am delighted to note that the employment issue looms large on the EU's programme of work."
"This report is proof of that."
"It contains many good ideas on ways of tackling mass unemployment, but there are also a number of omissions."
"In my view, we will only achieve full employment through combined and vigourous efforts."
"Most importantly, countries should be pursuing an economic policy aimed at full employment - to stimulate the economy with the ultimate objective of combating unemployment."
"Apart from the imperative of ensuring that the fight against unemployment is the constant and top priority of economic policy, there are three other important areas in the struggle to achieve full employment: education, job security and a wages policy."
"I welcome the report's aim of increasing employment."
"However, with regard to reducing taxes on employment, I would like to point out that there is no correlation between that and increased employment."
"Technical and empirical studies have failed to show that an overall reduction in employment taxation would increase employment."
"The extensive and independent studies that have been carried out reveal considerable uncertainty as to whether lower taxes affect employment."
"In the Scandinavian countries, in particular, such studies have failed to identify any such correlation."
"I am happy to vote for this report, noting as it does that an extra 750 000 jobs were created across the EU in the last year."
"But as we all know, other jobs are threatened by traditional problems such as skills shortages and by new problems such as the knock-on effects of financial market crises in East Asia and other parts of the world."
"The stark fact that more than half of all unemployed people aged 25 or more are classed as unskilled underlines the depth of the challenge we all face in the EU to raise our skills and raise our competitiveness in the global economy."
"I am glad that the New Deal for young people introduced by my own country's Government is to extend to older unemployed people in response to this challenge."
"We are in a long war against unemployment and we have to bridge the skills gap if we are to win the struggle."
"The report rightly calls for more quality childcare places to allow parents who do want to work to find and keep a job and thus support their family by their own efforts."
"Again, I would commend the British Government's radical national childcare strategy for further study in the rest of the EU."
"Of course, each country has to adopt policies to suit its own particular unemployment challenges, but I believe that the great changes in British policy embodies by the New Deal and the national childcare strategy are British answers to the common European problems of skill shortages and parents trapped on benefit with no childcare available."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this important report."
"Promoting social dialogue will be of the greatest benefit in strengthening the Community's policy on employment, labour markets and the enhancement of working life, as well as on social issues."
"The committee's proposal clarifies the role of the social dialogue in the provision of information and the intensification of negotiations. At the same time, a wider view of the importance of the social dialogue in partnerships for employment is put forward."
"As regards Amendment No 3 on the CEMR's participation in the combined sectors of information, consultation and negotiation, we do not support the proposal as a matter of principle."
"With regard to negotiations involving the different sectors within the framework of the social dialogue, which this amendment touches on, we do not think that the EU institutions should interfere in the selection of representatives to participate in the negotiations between the different partners."
"This is a matter for the social partners to decide for themselves, without any of them being deprived of their role by the Council, Parliament or Commission."
"We should also like to see the partners, when they so wish, involve the CEMR in the negotiations on the social dialogue, but only on their own initiative."
"We should like to point out the significance of paragraph 13 on the number of representatives in the new composition of the Standing Committee on Employment."
"A reduction in the number of representatives to no less than 12 would appear to be unavoidable. However, additional arrangements are required if the partners are to carry national authority."
"Paragraph 13 highlights this point, but the Commission should devote more attention to the practicalities of achieving this."
"Finally, we should also like to stress the importance of the Standing Committee on Employment being given the chance to discuss the EU guidelines on economic policy as well as the guidelines on employment policy."
"A strong employment policy in Europe clearly has an economic perspective which goes beyond the employment guidelines."
"So it would be quite natural for the Standing Committee on Employment to discuss the economic guidelines as well."
"We are unable to support the report on adapting and promoting the social dialogue at Community level, because we believe that the basis for the dialogue between the partners in the labour market is ultimately the establishment of what will in fact be EU agreements."
"At the same time, we think that it is problematic for the partners in the labour market, as it says in the report, to be involved 'in economic policy in the context of EMU'."
"Denmark has an exemption from the third stage of EMU."
"In our view this is an important exemption, because we do not agree with the Union's economic policy, which gives priority to combating inflation at the cost of measures to create jobs."
"Particularly in recent years, the labour market has been a focal point of EU regulation."
"This regulation is having ever greater consequences for the Danish system of agreements, and this is putting the Danish tradition under pressure."
"We feel it is important to retain the Danish model, which ensures that trade unions have substantial influence through the collective agreements that are negotiated, unlike the EU system, which is based on centrally dictated individual rights laid down by law."
"Transferring to the EU the responsibilities in this sector which previously lay with Denmark represents a fundamental break with the traditional system of collective agreements which has been very important in shaping the Danish model of society."
"This trend may therefore ultimately have implications for the system governing the labour market and society in Denmark."
"The labour market is undergoing rapid change, whereas the social dialogue is based on the corporatist viewpoint and is likely to preserve the old structure and create unnecessary regulations at EU level."
"I and my group are sceptical about giving any encouragement to the social dialogue which confers on the partners in the labour market a unique position under European legislation and an absurdly large degree of direct influence on policy-making - at a time when fewer people are choosing to join trade unions and many are remaining outside the labour market, with the result that the number of entrepreneurs and proprietors of small businesses, consultancy work and new types of employment conditions are all on the increase."
"Popularly elected politicians have a responsibility to reform labour market legislation, not to give the partners the right to introduce yet more rules."
"I have therefore decided to change my position in the final vote."
"European integration is a whole in which all Europe's citizens should be involved."
"If we wish to have greater cohesion, the social dialogue must fit in with the construction of economic union."
"Therefore, I must once again welcome the fact that the Protocol on Social Policy has been included in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that, evidently, the European Parliament's role within this framework is still unsatisfactory as, in effect, the Protocol abides by the general principle of Community law, according to which Parliament must give its assent on this matter."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's statement that it wishes to inform Parliament, comprehensively and in good time, to give it the opportunity to deliver its opinion before Council makes its decision."
"I agree with our rapporteur that the Commission's positive attitude should be interpreted as the first step on the road towards Parliament's full and complete participation in this procedure."
"Having said this, we must specify that true dialogue can clearly only take place between independent partners who have freely chosen to negotiate at the same table, and when all parties actually sit at that table."
"None of the actors in economic and social life can be kept out of the social dialogue against their will."
"SMEs should also be involved in the social dialogue, in the same way as other parties involved."
"In addition, there is a need to develop the social dialogue if we wish to resolve the major social and economic issues that are as yet unresolved, in a peaceful manner and in everyone's interests."
"Obviously, and most importantly, these issues include problems relating to employment."
"Although the latest figures published by Eurostat on the subject of unemployment within the Union are encouraging, they do not mask the widespread and lasting nature of this problem."
"What has just been said is particularly valid when it relates to data on the enlargement of the European Union to include the applicant countries."
"Therefore, we must welcome the Commission's wish to develop the social dialogue in these countries."
"We agree with the Peter report on the need to adapt and promote the social dialogue between both sides of the world of work."
"In this text, there are also some grand and noble declarations of principle on the role and missions which should be allotted to the two sides of industry, and we must welcome them."
"However, we voted against this report due both to some irrelevant aspects and to its shortcomings and omissions."
"In fact, the Peter report does not talk about the persecution of the national trade unions in France."
"It is because of this persecution that it is not possible for workers in France to create new trade unions or to stand freely as candidates in union or workplace elections, unless, of course, they belong to the trade unions that are recognised and restricted by law."
"Such violations of union and electoral rights are serious and unacceptable."
"The truth is that the official trade unions, which represent workers less and less, are only good for banning any form of competition."
"So, if Mr Peter wants to adapt and promote social dialogue, then let him start by taking an interest in the repeated attacks on trade union rights and in what is really happening in the countries of the EU."
"Then, and only then, will it be possible for dialogue and negotiation between workers and employers to take place without pretence or hypocrisy and without being dictated to by political correctness."
"The social dialogue should, above all, be based on consultation and agreement between the partners in the labour market."
"Legislation is not an end in itself, neither at national nor European level."
"National authorities and EU institutions should stress the importance of encouraging negotiations between self-governing and independent partners, rather than legislation."
"Power is unevenly divided in the labour market."
"It is still the case that employers' representatives have an advantage over those representing employees."
"The report is well-intentioned and is favourable towards the setting up of a real dialogue between the labour market partners, but it does not contain any meaningful analysis of the division of power in the labour market."
"Without this analysis and a recognition of how power is allocated, there can never be a real dialogue on social conditions in the overall labour market."
"In quite a short time the issue of the social dialogue has again come up for debate in the European Parliament."
"In view of that, we wish yet again to stress that the development of broad and productive thinking about the aims, content, results and future of the social dialogue at the Community level is a positive thing, to the extent that it leads to specific measures to strengthen that dialogue and to reverse the trend that the EU and its Member States are promoting, which involves degrading it or using it as an excuse to promote anti-labour measures and as a damper to suppress the social unrest and reactions brought about by the economic and social policies currently being implemented."
"For us, the central question is on the one hand the representativeness of the spokesmen for social agencies who take part in the negotiation procedures, and on the other hand the degree to which their views are taken into account when formulating the attitudes of the Community's bodies and those of the Member States."
"It is a characteristic fact that SMEs are still excluded from all forms of dialogue at Community level."
"It worries us in particular that the social dialogue in progress today in most cases has little connection with the central issues which concern working people in the EU, as a whole and in the various branches, sectors and regions."
"It is also not focused on the search for specific solutions to their very acute problems, on the effort to safeguard and extend their individual and collective rights, on the development of initiatives aiming to address the profound crisis that is affecting the EU and on the promotion of a progressive alternative solution to the liberalisation and globalisation dictated by the multinationals."
"The touchstone for all these things can only be to address the problem of unemployment and work, which cannot of course be dealt with on the basis of the Thatcherite model of shared unemployment or by creating 'jobs' governed by a regime of labour and security dumping."
"A real social dialogue cannot ignore the tragic results of the policy of liberalising the markets, the policy signalled by the criteria of EMU and the stability pact."
"A real social dialogue cannot ignore the fact that the overthrow of even the most elementary acquisitions of the trade union movement is being promoted, with collective labour agreements first in line."
"In our opinion, the most basic form of expression of the social dialogue if it is to play its part correctly, is collective bargaining aimed at the signing of collective labour agreements."
"Only in that way and in view of the increased legal force of such agreements, can working people be protected from the individualisation of labour relations, from the attempt to cut back their rights in the name of 'increased competitiveness' and more intense competition."
"Experience shows that whatever substitutes are put forward from time to time only aim to reduce the negotiating power and force of the trade union movement, to disorientate, fragment and undermine its champions, and ultimately to promote misrepresented views about class cooperation and cause it to abandon the role which it has historically been called on to play in the class struggle."
"What working people and their unions need today is the reinforcement of collective bargaining at EU and Member State level, solidarity from all who are fighting to oppose the overthrow of any notion of collectiveness, and decisive action against those who are undermining collective, structured and targeted dialogue and the central means for stating worker demands, namely collective labour agreements."
"Mr President, the trade negotiations that are about to begin with the United States on the Transatlantic Economic Partnership will follow a procedure that is far from clear."
"As this procedure will relate both to sectors which fall under Community jurisdiction - goods and public markets - and to sectors which fall under national jurisdiction - services and intellectual property - one would be forgiven for thinking that representatives of the Member States would be engaging in negotiations alongside the Commission."
"Yet this is not the method that has been chosen."
"The Commission will negotiate with the United States, both on behalf of the Community and on behalf of the Member States, by means of a global mandate."
"For sectors under national jurisdiction, we are told that the Member States will 'be involved in negotiations' but we are concerned that they will not be in charge of them, not even for their own sectors."
"It seems rather improper that this procedure has been chosen, particularly as we know full well that the Commission wishes to promote a free-trade area with the United States and that France experienced considerable difficulty in ruining the previous attempt, known as the NTM or New Transatlantic Marketplace."
"This procedure casts an interesting light on Paragraph 5 of the new Article 133 of the Amsterdam Treaty, currently being ratified in France."
"This text provides for the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, to extend Community competences to include international negotiations on services and intellectual property."
"I also note in passing that this procedure - which would deprive the French Parliament of its right to approve the ratification of Treaties as laid out in Article 53 of our constitution - seems as reprehensible as a very similar procedure on the movement of persons provided for in Article 67 and which has already been censured by the Constitutional Court in its decision of 31 December 1997."
"It may seem improper to allow the Commission engage in negotiations on services and intellectual property in view of the way it dealt with the Uruguay Round negotiations on goods."
"However, the form of negotiation used for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership clearly shows that, short of abandoning the Amsterdam Treaty now, the Member States are in danger of falling back into the same trap as before."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the content of the report by our colleague Mrs Erika Mann raises several questions, both in the field of economics and in the field of security and defence relations."
"Following Mrs Mann's lead, I believe that the parliamentary bodies should be involved as much as possible in the negotiations."
"I hope that we will not find ourselves in a situation similar to that of the MAI, where legitimately elected political leaders are consulted in the last resort, and whose importance, dare I say it, was deemed negligible."
"Therefore, we must keep a watchful eye on the content of this future agreement, particularly as regards the level of public aid."
"It is unthinkable that some of our partners impose draconian conditions whilst they themselves are exempt from such orders."
"In these negotiations, the European Union must be seen as a power in its own right and must be capable of making its voice heard without having unilateral decisions imposed upon it."
"This is probably one of its most glaring weaknesses."
"For the record, I would like remind the House of the directive on shipbuilding, where we hurried to apply measures which now work against our interests as we are the only ones who follow them."
"In this respect, I find it rather damaging that the Commission did not protest over the funds made available by the IMF to safeguard Korean shipyards that are already heavily subsidised by public authorities."
"Although I do share the concerns outlined in the text as regards health, consumer protection and the environment, I am more cautious and worried about promoting core labour standards together with the United States."
"I admit that I do not share the enthusiasm for a country which, for years now, has been the champion of exaggerated ultra-liberalism, which displays its inhumanity day after day."
"For many, the European Union is a relatively well-balanced pole of development that attempts to preserve economic dynamism and social justice."
"Let us ensure that we do preserve them!"
"The American diktat on European banana imports shows to what extent establishing an economic partnership between the European Union and the United States is still premature."
"This partnership would not only involve solving current disputes, but also asserting our ability to develop global and balanced relationships."
"Recent experience has proven the need to widen the scope of this type of negotiations to include the whole international community, particularly within the WTO. The outcome of the MAI and of the draft NTM should be reason enough for the European Commission to exercise greater caution."
"Therefore, whatever the common values and interests which unite the European Union and the United States, the very different attitudes to development, social policy and protection of the environment, as well as the need to preserve cultural sovereignty with all its diverse components, make the principle of privileged transatlantic relations in itself rather a deceptive one."
"It is for these reasons that the ARE Group has asked that this report be referred back to committee and this is also why we abstained from voting on this report."
"I will not vote in favour of Mrs Mann's report despite the quality of the work done by our rapporteur on developing a suitable framework for bilateral relations between Europe and the United States."
"Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is completely different and the European Parliament should voice loudly and clearly its disagreement with the attitude of the United States of America, particularly in the light of recent decisions - unilateral ones - made by that country."
"The United States' attitude towards the banana market, the fact that it announced unjustified protectionist rules and used pseudo dumping as an excuse to tax steel, all highlight the fact that opening the market is a good thing for the United States when it is to its own advantage and a bad thing when its interests are challenged."
"We are being deceived as there is no sincere commitment from this country towards balanced bilateral agreements."
"In fact, the Americans hope to benefit not only from their position of world domination, but also from Europe's weakness and from Europe's inability to react efficiently or to announce protective rules in retaliation, rules which convey an idea of shared progress."
"Europe could, for example, create socio-taxes and refuse products made using child labour or carried out without the least respect for ILO standards."
"The issue of environmental standards is equally important."
"The unacceptable attitude of the USA at the last summit on climate change in Buenos Aires is proof of their lack of respect for the general interests of the planet. It also highlights the threats that the transatlantic partnership agreements pose to European legislation on health and the environment."
"In effect, there will be an increase in the arrival of large quantities of products containing GMOs or made using procedures that do not respect our environmental regulations. Europe could find itself being penalised if it does not impose an environmental framework on its imports that is as rigorous as measures within the European Union."
"Lastly, the ambiguous attitudes of the Commission and of Leon Brittan have weakened the EU's links with the United States."
"Fortunately, the Council has rejected the MAI and the NTM but, in a bid to protect itself from fresh manoeuvring, it has drawn up a restrictive framework for monitoring the Commission which, in fact, puts Parliament on the sidelines, and this has extremely serious implications for the future."
"So the European Parliament should now say that this cannot go on."
"American domination and the Americans' lack of respect for the rules cannot continue."
"Europe must retaliate."
"The lack of social and environmental standards in world trade cannot be tolerated for much longer."
"Multilateral agreements or bilateral agreements cannot be signed without such standards."
"The European Parliament can no longer be kept out of these negotiations."
"If it wishes to make itself heard, the European Parliament cannot be kept out of these negotiations."
"And in order to make itself heard, Parliament should have formally voted for this report to be referred back."
"It did not do so."
"Therefore, by voting against this report, I would like to express my severe discontent with the way Europe has backtracked and capitulated to the United States."
"The FPÖ rejects the report on 'The New Transatlantic Marketplace' because first we need a comprehensive and public discussion of the objectives and impact of this kind of partnership."
"The rejection of the Brittan plan was intended to throw dust in the eyes of all those who reacted strenuously to the creation of a new transatlantic market which would put working people in Europe in an even more difficult position."
"The substance of that plan remains unchanged even after today's developments, the only difference being that the rate at which the specific plans are promoted will be different and greater flexibility will be shown in their implementation."
"But the principles of the new agreement are still to protect major capital and its unimpeded movement, to safeguard the unaccountability of the monopolies and of market liberalisation, and to restrict the ways in which the Member States and even the European institutions themselves can intervene and exercise control."
"These measures are regarded as essential for the preparation of the new round of multipartite negotiations in the context of the WTO and the talks on the Multipartite Agreement on Investment in the context of the OECD."
"They are an attempt to create new faits accomplis ."
"The political agreement achieved during the recent summit between the two sides and the Commission's action plan for transatlantic economic cooperation give cause for serious concern and raise some pointed questions, since important issues concerning public health, labour relations and the rights of working people, consumer protection, matters related to the free provision of services and the liberalisation of public contracts and to the promotion of regulatory cooperation and the abolition of technical trade barriers, are to be determined without any democratic or political control."
"Characteristically, in order to prevent possible reactions, the Commission has chosen the method of sectoral agreements on which the European Parliament delivers non-binding opinions, instead of a framework agreement requiring Parliament's approval, thus avoiding any possibility of greater control and intervention."
"Besides, it is not by chance that the provisions establishing the procedures for the EU's trade policy were not amended and enable the Council and the Commission to employ suitable devices to achieve the signing of very important agreements without much 'interference'."
"Indeed, the fact that such a method was chosen after the reactions provoked at national and Community level by the publication of the draft OECD multipartite agreement on investments and the Brittan plan leads us to the natural conclusion that working people and the popular movement must remain vigilant and intensify their struggles. The danger is not only not past but, on the contrary, is greater than ever, because the various substitutes for those agreements being promoted are presented as 'more prudent' and less ambitious in their formulation and timing, though they follow exactly the same anti-populist direction."
"The Mutual Recognition Agreements constitute an ingredient of the new agreement."
"Their aim is to facilitate the flow of trade, with a decisive role for technocratic committees subject to no democratic control at all."
"This lends strength to the view that the existence of legal provisions to protect public health and the environment constitutes an artificial barrier to trade, and seeks essentially to abolish safety requirements."
"There is also serious concern about the provisions for further liberalisation of public procurement and about the services and the coordination envisaged in the context of the new round of multipartite negotiations on investments, agriculture and intellectual property."
"No concern at all is shown about social rights, about reinforcing provisions that protect working people, or about any commitment to incorporate the basic ILO conventions in the WTO system."
"On the contrary, the increasingly frequent statements that labour legislation must not constitute a means of 'protectionism' convince us that once trade in goods and services has been liberalised, the next item on the agenda will be to dislocate labour relations and restrict state authority in the matter via the WTO, in other words to promote the related provisions of the Multipartite Agreement on Investments within the framework of the multipartite trade system."
"We believe the plan for transatlantic economic cooperation fails to represent the interests of working people on either side of the Atlantic."
"On the contrary, it supports the choices of the major multinationals, which have been working since 1995 in the context of the 'Transatlantic Business Dialogue' towards the abolition of provisions that restrict their activities."
"It is an agreement which again signals the EU's compromising attitude towards the USA and its frequent attitude in favour of promoting the schemes of major capital in its frontal assault against working people."
"Besides, this is clear from the settlement agreement on the extraterritorial Helms-Burton and D'Amato laws, and also emerges from the provisions for agriculture and for the opto-acoustic industry."
"This agreement discloses the true nature of international trade negotiations on so-called equal terms."
"The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs we are debating, despite the few welcome comments it contains, accepts that framework overall and we will therefore vote against it."
"We share the rapporteur's desire to improve trade relations between the EU and the USA."
"This is a comprehensive report covering a wide range of issues relating to the new transatlantic marketplace."
"However, we do not agree with the assertion in recitals B and C, as well as in paragraph 1, that the EU and the USA share the same security and defence policy, as well as economic, political, cultural and environmental values."
"As regards security and defence polity, this is even more relevant in Sweden's case since it is a non-aligned country and not a member of NATO."
"We welcome the clear indication in paragraph 25 that the Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts are unacceptable, and we wholeheartedly support the recommendation to speedily eliminate them."
"I am happy to support this report by my colleague, Erika Mann."
"It is often the case that close links with other countries are most important when we have disagreements with them."
"This could not be more true than this week with the US Congress apparently set to start a trade war with the EU over objections to our support for banana growers in former British and European colonies in the Caribbean."
"Like many people, I believe that we should have as free an international trade system as possible, free from distortions to fair and open competition."
"However, free trade needs to be fair trade as well, as in the case of the Caribbean banana growers."
"A little assistance to their exports to the EU does not threaten the already massive market share of US-owned banana producers in the EU and the rest of the world."
"The kind of close dialogue called for by the London EU-US summit earlier this year should be established as soon as possible, to help both parties in the new transatlantic community to defuse and hopefully avoid such disagreements in future."
"That is why I urge fellow MEPS to vote for Erika Mann's sensible report today, and not egg on the Republican zealots in the US Congress who would love us to react in kind to their trade war bluster."
"Regular EU-US dialogue would allow us to point out the errors of Congress' approach to the EU's support for Caribbean banana exports to Europe, which keeps their economies going in a legal trade, and stops the temptation which would otherwise exist for farmers there to grow even more hard drugs - and both American and EU politicians know the damage they do to our young people when the drugs reach our streets."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Pre-accession strategy (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the pre-accession strategy."
"Mr President, the very title of the Barón Crespo report on the proposal for a Council regulation on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy summarises the faults and handicaps that afflict European integration, which, at the dawn of the 21st century, is still trudging along very slowly."
"Once again, priority has been given to economics and not to politics, and the plan for European integration appears to be nothing more than a regional version of globalisation of the economy."
"Economics is what divides Europeans."
"Politics and culture are what unite them."
"Yet, the closer we get to political union, the further away it drifts from us."
"It is, as I have already said, the modern version of the torment of Tantalus."
"Economically speaking, I also believe that we are taking the wrong path by refusing to fight in the world economic war, by not accepting the principle of Community preference championed by Maurice Allais and which I have so often pleaded in favour of in this House."
"I should like to conclude, Mr President, by returning to the main issue, to the primacy of politics over economics."
"Eventually, Europe must learn to eat to live and stop living to eat."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen - and let me give a warm welcome to our visitors from the Central and Eastern European countries in the gallery - what we are trying to achieve here in the European Union is basically not enlargement but the integration of the Central and Eastern European states, the integration of people who are of course Europeans and who have not so far been given the chance to join this Community."
"So they are partners, with whom we are working together, and when we look at current developments in, for example, the field of trade, we find that here there is unfortunately a dramatic imbalance against the applicant countries and that we must ensure that this imbalance is corrected, since we can only be partners if we work together on an equal footing in this economic area as well."
"The Polish President said something remarkable this morning, which is true for both sides: 'One does not refurbish the house merely because there are guests coming'."
"That means that the European Union, the 15 Member States, must also do their own work first, especially in a sector that always tends to be pushed to one side, the agricultural sector."
"Basically, the Central and Eastern European states find themselves in an absurd situation here."
"On the one hand they are to adopt an acquis communautaire , the European Union rules, while on the other hand the European Union has not taken any major step forward in even formulating the agricultural reform, the new agricultural policy."
"If we now take a critical look at ourselves, and if the pace at which the hard-baked representatives of the interests of the agricultural lobby are pursuing these vital reforms is to serve as a model for the Central and Eastern European states, it will take several decades before these states can become integrated."
"That is another self-criticism we shall have to accept."
"We must also take these representatives critically to task and say: if they do not want the reform of the common agricultural policy, then logically they do not want enlargement of the European Union either, or only enlargement on the medieval model, whereby these areas would merely be colonies, markets for selling our goods; that is not democratic enlargement."
"Social policy plays an important role in this enlargement!"
"Here we must tell our partners clearly, and emphasise during the discussions, that at present every single Member State of the European Union is responsible for its social policy and that naturally those countries that want to join us will have to be responsible for their social policy, for instance their labour market policy."
"That is not a disadvantage; basically it is also part of adopting the acquis communautaire ."
"Mr President, 60 seconds of speaking time is not enough for a comprehensive analysis."
"So I would like to concentrate on one aspect of the Barón Crespo report."
"The rapporteur would also like to finance agricultural development measures out of PHARE funds."
"Only recently, Parliament took some ECU 200 million from the PHARE programme for the 1999 financial year and allocated it to other areas of external relations."
"Its reasoning was that the absorption capacity of the Central and Eastern European states was exhausted."
"Is it not absurd to decide a few weeks later to give further PHARE support to the tune of ECU 1 560 million?"
"In the light of the irregularities that have occurred in connection with PHARE, I am against supporting agriculture in the Central and Eastern European countries with funds from that programme while EU farmers have to accept massive losses as a result of Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, Commissioner, people can only say the kind of things the previous speaker has just said if they believe they can turn back the clock."
"The European integration process is marching on, if not perhaps at the pace President Kwasniewski suggested here today."
"He beautifully described the dynamic of the Polish development process, and also said that Poland would probably no longer need any transitional periods."
"I do not share his view."
"I believe that Poland will certainly need transitional provisions with regard to economic and environmental matters, and not just concerning the free movement of workers."
"But I do not want to go into that any further at this point."
"The fact is - and I am assuming that we all want this integration process - that the quality of the EU enlargement process very much depends of course on the quality of the preparations for it."
"That is why it is extremely important to coordinate the aid and the structural policy instruments."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was particularly concerned with social and employment policy questions."
"We must firmly support social policy mainstreaming."
"That is why it is so important not just to strengthen the administrative structures of the institutions, but also to promote the social dialogue."
"Here the aim is to develop, structure and support employer/worker relations in European policy."
"That is the only way to make European policy at all meaningful and transposable."
"The social partners are best able to do this."
"The PHARE instruments, which are primarily designed to support institutional development, provide the framework conditions for promoting social dialogue in the appropriate manner."
"Mrs Wulf-Mathies addressed this matter yesterday, when we were discussing the social dialogue in Europe, and Mr Flynn also underlined its importance."
"If that applies in Europe, it also applies in the integration process."
"That is why we must support the concept, and of course the further development of the social dialogue in the framework of enlargement."
"Mr President, as a member of the European Parliament representing Portuguese voters, I should like to make three points very clear:"
"we are in favour of the enlargement of the European Union and the negotiation procedure under way; -we are in favour of the institutional review that is needed to strengthen Europe internally and for its external representation and presence; -we are committed to the debate on Agenda 2000, the reform of the common agricultural policy, the new framework for the policy of cohesion and regional development, own resources, and so on.What we cannot accept is the attempt by some people, behind the scenes, to break off the contract of internal solidarity enabling the various European regions and countries - especially those with delays and development problems - to participate fully in the European project and to offer their peoples legitimate hopes of progress within a political and economic area without first-class citizens and second-class Europeans."
"I should also like to make it quite clear here and now that the amendments tabled by Mr Berend, calling into question the Cohesion Fund, will lead us down a slippery slope with very serious consequences."
"There are many other points that we are hoping to clarify in the negotiations and they are negotiable; but this point is not negotiable."
"My country and other Member States have made an enormous effort and, against all the odds, they have succeeded in meeting the conditions for participating fully in the euro."
"They cannot and must not be penalised and, in any case, that would violate the provisions in the treaties."
"We shall definitely be making our contribution towards financing enlargement."
"What we cannot accept is that the poor countries will end up paying."
"Mr President, this debate is about what we in Europe can do to facilitate the enlargement process, which must be a burning issue for us all."
"In a world once split by dissent, we now have a chance to demonstrate our capacity to overcome the difficulties as we contemplate a major political step."
"The Sonneveld report clearly shows that substantial funding - ECU 3 billion per year in all - has been made available to help the applicant countries to make the necessary changes for future membership of the EU."
"In my view, this is not a matter of 'pocket money', and I share the rapporteur's opinion that resources should continue to be concentrated on strategic actions."
"The resolution which will be discussed later today calls for an in-depth analysis of Europe's financial situation following the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, so that we would then have a sound basis for a decision."
"Nevertheless, I would like to highlight the dynamic effect that enlargement of the Union would have, and also my belief that the positive results would very quickly outweigh any budgetary effects."
"The Commission's proposal on agricultural reform, as set out in Agenda 2000, goes mainly in the right direction."
"It should help to place the global market on a firmer footing and enable the EU's agricultural industry to play a more active role in the market."
"As a result, enlargement would be made considerably easier and any negative budgetary consequences for the EU would not be overpowering."
"The transitional arrangements will also facilitate the process."
"Regardless of the problems we will encounter, it is vital that we never lose sight of the overriding goal of making Europe a better and more harmonious place by means of enlargement."
"Mr President, Europe's progress towards genuine integration, the enlargement with the accession of Cyprus and the eastern European countries, the one plus ten countries, is a historic decision which has been taken and is not questioned by anyone, always in accordance with the clear Copenhagen criteria in force."
"This is no longer just a political aim to be achieved eventually, but a colossal enterprise which has already started and has a clear timetable."
"I believe that the precise effect of today's debate on the Commission's proposals is:"
"to prove that a decision of such historic scope can be achieved by a specific strategy, as complex and detailed as necessary but at the same time one which is cohesive, harmonious, and has clear mechanisms, procedures and legal bases; -to demonstrate that the European Parliament has powers and responsibilities in this great matter and aspires to exercise them.So: pre-accession aid for the applicant countries, enhanced where necessary, and in parallel internal reforms in the European Union."
"That must be the European Parliament's message to the citizens of Europe 2000, the citizens of the 15 Member States and those of the one plus ten applicant countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we find it unacceptable for the EU Commission, so far at least, to take it upon itself alone to define the eligible areas for regional and national funding too."
"I was pleased to read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last week that you are prepared to meet us halfway here."
"I would sincerely ask you actually to do so."
"Countries like Germany and regions like Bavaria really must continue to be able to determine their own priority support areas in future too."
"Amendment No 47 by Mr Schiedermeier calls for just that possibility, which is in our view quite self-evident, namely that we can determine our own priority support areas with our own money."
"We cannot have our hands tied and not be able to allocate aid where we consider it necessary to do so, on the basis of our analysis, for the purposes of structural policy."
"The Commission must not be able to tie our hands here completely."
"We are happy to show solidarity with the structurally weaker areas."
"But in return we expect a minimum of solidarity with our problems, given that we are dealing here not with EU funds but with our own support funds."
"I know the final decision on this has not yet been taken, but we want to make it clear here and now that we see a link between the reports being considered today and the ones that are still to come."
"My CSU colleagues and I regard this aspect as so important that our vote on the Hatzidakis report will depend on whether Amendment No 47 is accepted."
"Thank you for your attention, and let me point out that I have used ten seconds less than my speaking time."
"Mr President, in creating the pre-accession aid programme for applicant countries the Council was aiming for a flexible system."
"The varying backgrounds and needs of the applicant countries have to be taken into consideration when planning such aid programmes."
"Already at this stage of the initial screening and negotiation process it has become clear that there is a need for investment under the PHARE programme in all countries concerned, particularly for 'institution building' in order to implement Community law and modernise the legal systems."
"This will also have a multiplier effect on matters such as the rooting out of corruption and the fight against organised crime."
"While we are discussing whether the aid given by the European Union will prove to be adequate, it is worth remembering that the main force for change in the enlargement process is not and cannot be the Union's present bottomless purse but a natural desire on the part of the applicant countries to achieve the standards required for EU membership as quickly as possible."
"The applicant countries must themselves finance most of the changes required."
"This is the only way we can both ensure we have the approval of the citizens of the present Union and guarantee the success of policy decisions taken with regard to the enlargement process as a whole."
"The aim of flexibility in pre-accession partnership also means that the Union needs new policy-making tools to increase cooperation with applicant countries, and one of the most significant elements here must be considered to be the Union's northern dimension, as presented at the Vienna Summit on the initiative of Finland."
"Via this northern dimension cooperation networks could be established, for example, in the areas of environmental protection and nuclear safety with the Baltic States, and we would get Russia involved in large-scale regional security projects."
"Mr President, the substance of our policy and the grandeur of the historic political enterprise which we call the European Union is expressed through the policy of economic and social cohesion, in other words through the practical expression of solidarity towards the less favoured countries."
"The Union's political and economic interests make it necessary to outline a strategy which will create a climate of security and hope for all parts of the European continent, which will abolish the divisive lines of the past, and which will guarantee a decent life for all social groups and will in practice confirm the principles of European humanism and the values of peace, equality, democracy and solidarity."
"Enlargement must come about with generosity and dignity, with planning and rapidity, with imagination and vision, with participation by the citizens and with care for the preservation and use of Europe's multicultural wealth."
"I wish to stress that any attempt to change course on the conditions for the accession of the Republic of Cyprus would call into question the Union's authority and credibility as a whole."
"And when talking about enlargement, let us also not forget that the European continent includes all the countries between the Atlantic and the Urals without exception, if we really want to do away with the divisive lines of the past and build a united and strong Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, official negotiations opened on the accession of six - or, as we keep saying, 5 + 1 - countries to the European Union."
"We have completed seven chapters of the acquis screening."
"We now know that considerable progress can be made in this area too if we work consistently."
"Let us perhaps look back a few years, or even longer."
"We see that in those days, Europe was facing problems with dictatorial regimes, that we were at war, and that in founding the European Union we were endeavouring to establish a system of democracy, market economy and security in Europe."
"I believe we must always regard these as the central aims."
"The Pope did so during the visit to Vienna."
"He said that we do not want enlargement of the Union - we are in fact Europe, and we should try constantly to move closer towards the same principles in a common Europe."
"I believe a comprehensive concept for the accession strategies is quite simply necessary in order to prepare the applicant countries for the single market and political union."
"I myself am vice-chairman of the Slovakia/European Parliament delegation."
"It has become particularly evident in the case of Slovakia that our policy has done much to change the system, that its positions are now clear, and that the country is also perfectly adapted to accession."
"I believe we should make it quite clear, again and again, that we are not urging accession, but that the door to Europe stands open."
"However, it is up to these countries themselves how quickly they can meet the conditions which are plainly set out before them."
"Mr President, everyone accepts that enlargement is a historic challenge and a historic step."
"However, this means that the European Union has many responsibilities to live up to, and I am sorry to have to stress that although all the reports by our colleagues on the eligibility of the various countries, one by one, speak of the conditions to be fulfilled by those countries, there is no mention of the fact that the European Union itself has obligations in the same parallel process, in other words the present 15 Member States must also fulfil their own obligations."
"The structure we wish to extend must have firm foundations and it must be functional."
"But how can it be functional when at present, between Maastricht and the present day, the European Unions's most vital policy, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, has not only failed to be promoted but is being dangerously afflicted?"
"For example, in conflict with the European Union's commitments on the Cyprus question, a few days ago four Member States of the Union expressed views which are provocative towards another Member State."
"What sort of example are we setting for the countries which we are inviting in and which we are even trying to help before their accession, when the European Union does not abide by its own basic policies and statutory obligations?"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Structural Funds"
"Mr President, I want to begin by saying that although this concept has been much discussed already, we must return to it in today's debate and consider its importance."
"I refer to the concept of economic and social cohesion, which is directly related to the present debate."
"Economic and social cohesion is one of the European Union's basic pillars and is directly related to the single market, and in my view, to the establishment of the single currency as well."
"The single market could make rich areas richer and poor ones poorer under certain conditions, and that was why, as early as the 1980s, the then European Community correctly conceived the mechanisms of the Structural Funds so that weaker areas would be supported."
"The same applies to the single currency."
"Coincidence of name is not enough to achieve the European Union's objectives and to establish a really strong euro."
"There must also be real convergence and the economic and social cohesion policies contribute towards that."
"In that context, the Structural Funds play a very important part."
"It would be unjust if I were now to try and decry the contribution they have made so far."
"They have contributed substantially in all areas, regions and countries where they have provided help."
"They have assisted convergence, vocational training and the education of the workforce, but of course there is always scope for them to help still more substantially."
"I now come to the heart of today's debate."
"This review is taking place at a turning point which we identify with enlargement and with the next millennium."
"Great care must therefore be taken to learn lessons from the past and to lay emphasis on certain sectors."
"Clearly, the areas covered by the Structural Funds must be limited."
"They cannot cover 52 % of the Union's population."
"Emphasis should be placed on the poorer regions, on the problems of unemployment and equal opportunities, and of course, we will have to consider alternative methods of managing the Funds."
"We will have to simplify the procedures and encourage greater participation by the private sector in the activities of the Structural Funds, because then, from the European Union's point of view, we could achieve much more with the same money."
"Beyond that, I wish to refer to some points in the report that Mrs McCarthy and I prepared, which I regard as particularly important."
"I think that Objective 1 must be the point on which the strongest emphasis is placed."
"For that reason, we believe Objective 1 should receive exactly two-thirds of the resources. Not approximately."
"Just as we say that structural activities should take up 0.46 % of the resources, we should talk about the amount to be earmarked for Objective 1 with equal clarity."
"I also consider that the European Union's poorer areas, in other words those regions in which the per-capita GDP is below 70 % of the Community average, should be co-financed more extensively up to as much as 85 %, as happens now for example with the remotest peripheral regions."
"In the context of the Interreg initiative, I think it is important to have a special sub-programme for cooperation between islands and for cooperation between mainland regions and islands, to flesh out what we voted for in Amsterdam, in other words the amendment of the Treaty which provides special treatment for island regions."
"I also wish to stress that we oppose the Commission's proposal that there should be an effectiveness reserve amounting to something like 10 % of the resources."
"That 10 % corresponds to ECU 20 billion, or an entire Cohesion Fund."
"Consequently, we oppose that proposal."
"It creates uncertainty in planning and enables the Commission to deal with a very large sum without accountability, and we therefore do not think that proposal by the Commission should go through."
"We also should not approve the Commission's proposal that unspent amounts should be given to other Member States two-plus-one years after they were first committed."
"We consider that at least in the first phase they should be held for the same Member State."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to present the report on the cohesion fund on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"Last March the Commission presented its proposals to Parliament for the next programming period running from 2000-2006."
"These proposals are set out in a series of draft regulations and as far as the cohesion fund is concerned the Commission has tabled two sets of amendments."
"The first set concerns the articles of the regulation itself and the second set concerns Annex II to the regulation which sets out in detail the provisions for implementing the basic principles."
"My report on the cohesion fund respects the main guidelines set out in the Commission's proposals and also welcomes the fact that the Commission fund will remain largely the same."
"Eligibility for the cohesion fund as stated in the report will apply to Member States with a per capita GNP of less than 90 % of the Community average."
"This is explicitly stated in Protocol 15 on economic and social cohesion of the Treaty."
"It is my belief that despite the significant benefits that the cohesion countries receive from this fund and despite the strong economic growth of recent years there is still a significant infrastructural deficit in the cohesion countries."
"These countries - Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal - simply do not have the same level of basic infrastructural facilities which typify the rest of Europe."
"A gap still exists between them and the more developed regions of Europe."
"The Commission's funding proposal is therefore consistent with generating long-term growth and promoting economic and social cohesion."
"Continued EU funding is necessary to help consolidate the progress made so far."
"The recognition of this by Agenda 2000 proposals is very welcome."
"Despite comments made in some quarters I categorically reject any link being made between economic and monetary union and the cohesion fund."
"In fact, as Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs I participated in the negotiation and the signature of the Maastricht Treaty, which included the agreement on economic and monetary union."
"At that time it had also been decided that Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece needed an increase in structural funding in order to help them catch up with the EU average economic performance."
"No link whatsoever was made between monetary union and cohesion fund eligibility at that time and I do not see any reason to establish one now."
"Certain innovative measures contained in the Commission's proposals are in principle correct."
"I welcome the Commission's efforts to improve the functioning of the fund."
"However, the practical implementation of the new measure needs further clarification."
"For example, the 'polluter pays' principle can be supported with a view to ensuring high environmental standards for projects."
"However, guidelines need to be set out for the application of this principle which should logically take into account the particular circumstances which exist in the four Member States to which the fund will apply."
"As far as project financing is concerned, a single advance of 10 % as a first payment is too limited."
"The initial phase of a project is crucial from a qualitative point of view and a significant percentage of the total available money is generally necessary to guarantee the commencement of a project."
"Moreover a small advance could lead to discrimination against regions which are unable to generate sufficient start-up financing from their own resources."
"Even though I am extremely sensitive to the Commission's concern to keep the total cost of the plan and the annual breakdown in line with implementation on the one side and the progress of work in line with the advances paid on the other, I still consider that a 10 % advance is too limited and it would be too heavy a burden on less-favoured regions to support the initial phase of a project."
"In view of the difficulties encountered in the previous programming period with regard to financial corrections and, more precisely, reducing, suspending or cancelling aid in the event of an irregularity, it seems to me that the appropriate response is to reduce or cancel the advance only in respect of the irregularity and not the entire project."
"Irregularities can easily be detected and corrected without interrupting the continuation of the project."
"By the same token the principle of automatic cancellation of assistance, in other words the cancellation of any commitment for which a payment application has not been made by the end of the second year, should certainly encourage Member States to implement their projects within time limits."
"However, the amount decommitted should be reassigned to the same Member State in order to penalise the region or, better still, just the project, but not the whole country."
"Finally, I wish to express my concern over the consequences of a strict application of the mid-term review as it stands in the proposal."
"My report points out that if, at the time when the mid-term review is carried out, any Member State ceases to be eligible, it would be advisable to foresee some kind of an arrangement for phasing out, as is being actively considered with regard to the structural funds."
"The end of eligibility for the cohesion fund is obviously a matter which will be decided on the basis of the relevant statistics."
"However, sudden cessation of funding to a country which has made good use of the funds could have too severe an impact on the country's economic wellbeing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that today we are holding a joint debate of great importance."
"As the democratic representatives of the citizens and peoples of Europe we are debating what should be the guidelines for the Commission's policy in Europe for the next seven years."
"I think that the European Parliament, and particularly its Committee on Regional Policy, has risen to the occasion."
"Our contributions, which tomorrow will be taken on board by the entire Parliament, define and improve the Commission's proposals."
"In this set of proposals, the ultimate regional financial instrument is the ERDF, which, under Article 130c of the Treaty, is assigned the role of redressing the main imbalances in the Community."
"The specific quality of the ERDF is the fact that it identifies with the central core of the cohesion policy, which, in the words of Article 130a of the Treaty, is aimed at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions, which is why more than 50 % of funding for the cohesion policy between 1998 and 1999 has been made available through the ERDF."
"The Commission's proposal does not offer a great deal that is new to a Fund that is as broad and versatile as the ERDF and that, in addition, has generally worked very well."
"Your rapporteur believes that the European Parliament has enriched the proposal, defining the priorities and adding different political connotations to the technical proposals, connotations that have come from the amendments of the different parliamentary groups and committees. Moreover, it gives the proposal as a whole a coherent structure that also, undoubtedly, identifies better with the problems that concern citizens and the less developed regions of Europe."
"The European Parliament report combines economic and social cohesion with European territorial cohesion by developing regional planning."
"Regional planning means better communications, greater attractions for industry and greater opportunities for growth."
"In short, it means more development, employment and welfare."
"Territorial cohesion means fighting to overcome the permanent geographical disadvantages of peripheral or island regions, and to promote the building of links among those regions and between them and the central regions of the Community."
"The ERDF has an essential challenge in this field and, in order to promote the development of these backward and peripheral regions, the majority of which are maritime regions, the European Parliament is calling for the development of maritime transport, an issue that is unresolved in the Community. This would reduce congestion in land transport, help the environment, and thus contribute to the development of the backward regions."
"Our report also advocates the explicit inclusion of cultural investments that create employment, that tend to protect natural and cultural heritage, and those aimed at developing sustainable tourism, eco-tourism and cultural tourism."
"It develops the Commission's proposal to explicitly include those investments that are aimed at preserving or recovering a region's industrial basis, or those specifically aimed at local development."
"Our report is in favour of maintaining the Community initiative URBAN, which, along with INTERREG, has clearly brought added value to the Community."
"Support for Interreg has been unanimous and there are great hopes for Interreg III, both in its traditional field of cross-border cooperation, in which the European Parliament is now asking for the explicit inclusion of inter-island and maritime cooperation, and in its new section C on transnational cooperation between large regions of Europe - a field that is also very closely linked to regional planning."
"Finally, the report includes a broad development of specific business activities aimed at promoting small and medium-sized enterprises and cooperation between enterprises, services for enterprises, renewable energy sources and respect for the environment."
"The Commission can say or will say that its proposal already enabled the Member States to include these and other aspects, but the European Parliament, through its various political tendencies, wanted these issues to be clearly specified. They could thus identify with the views of the citizens and peoples that we represent, guiding and also giving priority to the activities that in due course will have to be included in the programmes to be funded by the European Fund for Regional Development."
"Therefore, as well as having a good technical document, we now also have a good political document."
"I think we have done a good job at first reading and I would like to conclude by thanking the Members in the various parliamentary groups and committees who, with their amendments, have contributed to enriching this report for which I had the honour of being rapporteur."
"I would like to end by mentioning the structural aspects of fisheries."
"Today, I would particularly like to make my voice heard in this House - in order to represent the regions that are dependent on fisheries, whatever their aims - in strong support of the position widely held by the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries on the future FIFG regulation."
"I would like to highlight point 13 of the report on the general regulation and to ask why the fisheries sector does not receive the same treatment as agriculture."
"Commissioner, the fisheries sector needs a serious, rigorous, single and horizontal structural regulation that covers all its measures and gives legal certainty to its potential beneficiaries."
"I hope that you can do so in time and that you will rectify this and accept Parliament's position."
"Mr President, this is really a first-reading type debate under the Hughes procedure and I must say that I shall welcome the new rules for the Hughes procedure when they come about and hope that the second reading will be subject to them."
"I am presenting, on behalf of the Budgets Committee, one report and five opinions."
"The report is about new rules for financing the trans-European networks."
"It is a rather technical report about the Commission finding more money to be available to fund the already agreed policies."
"As I say, it is a technical report and it will be my intention to resist amendments which are about policy and not about the subject of the report."
"We shall be voting on that tomorrow."
