"But what should we do next?"
"Over the past decade, the European Union has played an active role in support of wider international efforts to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."
"Since the beginning of the humanitarian emergency in the early 1990s, we have been a major donor, delivering some EUR 345 million in assistance since 1995."
"We also played our part in support of earlier non-proliferation efforts through the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation, and we have offered political support for the six-party talks, although we are not direct participants in that process."
"Clearly, as a global player that has done its share in the past, we should now play our part again in response to what is clearly a global problem."
"The international community will have to take clear action."
"Somebody will have to talk to the North Korean regime to bring it out of its very paranoid and aggressive posture, and the man who I believe has been designated as the next UN Secretary-General might be the right person to do so."
"It is still a little early to say what action we should take, although various options are on the table."
"As a staunch advocate of multilateralism, the European Union must pay particular attention to what is decided in the United Nations."
"In line with the Treaties, we look to the EU Member States sitting on the Security Council to take due account of EU views as they participate actively in these important discussions in New York."
"I am pleased to note that the negotiations within the Security Council appear to be making good and rapid progress towards a substantive and clear resolution on this matter."
"With regard to humanitarian assistance, the population has suffered enormously, and therefore I would like to keep up the humanitarian assistance to these people in the future."
"They should not be put at risk and punished even more by the terrible regime."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, North Korea's nuclear tests are a provocation and a threat to the international community: a provocation, because North Korea is a dictatorial regime in the Stalinist style, Mr President, which keeps its people starved and which should dedicate its resources to a nobler cause than nuclear proliferation, rather than taking advantage of the suspension of the six-party talks and of the fact that it is outside of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."
"Mr President, it is also a threat to international security because it seriously compromises the values of peace and stability in a region of the world that is particularly sensitive, namely South-East Asia."
"It is therefore very important that the international community react effectively and appropriately, and hence it is good news, as Mr Solana and the Commissioner have said, that the permanent members of the Security Council and Japan have met to examine a whole list of sanctions in response to that provocation."
"Mr Solana, it would be good to hear the Council's position on the list of measures or sanctions that could be applied to North Korea by the United Nations, a list of sanctions that range from the application of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to that of Article 41, which only provides for economic and commercial sanctions."
"I also believe, Mr President, that it is excellent news that, for the first time, China has been prepared to respond, within the context of the United Nations and the Security Council, appropriately and with possible sanctions."
"Mr President, this is very much a model case."
"We must not forget that Iran will be watching how this crisis develops extremely closely."
"On behalf of the European Union, Mr Solana has been involved in the resolution of Iran's nuclear escalation; it is therefore clear that the international community in general and the European Union in particular cannot remain blind, deaf and dumb in the face of this provocation, and its response must be firm, effective and appropriate, in accordance with the values of peace, democratic consolidation, reconciliation and multilateralism that we in the European Union advocate."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is being conducted against the backdrop of a difficult situation, but I do think that what Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have said shows that the European Union, in the persons of its High Representative and its Foreign Affairs Commissioner, is trying to respond to it in the right way."
"It is only normal that our response should be one of anger."
"It is quite clear that what is happening is that a system that is on its last legs is trying, by means of provocation to get others to respect it and pay it attention, and perhaps to reap some advantage in so doing."
"That is not a matter of doubt, and the normal response is to say that this will not be allowed, that it cannot be allowed, and that boundaries must be set, knowing full well that the choice of possible responses is limited by that fact that - to turn the argument on its head - the possession of a nuclear weapon by a regime such as this one, whose actions are so unpredictable, itself constitutes an incalculable risk."
"In a situation such as this, we have to think before we act, and so, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, our group unreservedly endorses what you said about the need for a distinction to be drawn between what a delusional dictator gets up to with his armed forces and what the other side needs to do with humanitarian considerations in mind."
"The people should not be punished for the madness of the dictator who rules over them, and it is for that reason that we support these measures."
"Secondly, we must try to reopen diplomatic channels; there is no alternative to that, for, whatever this dictator does, one must try to read his behaviour and discern what chances are still open to us."
"Have all the avenues been closed off whereby North Korea might be brought back to talk to the Six?"
"I do not believe that they have been."
"Not every avenue has been closed off."
"It is still possible to make the attempt to get the North Koreans back to the negotiating table."
"Difficult though that task might be, it is also clear that it is not merely fortuitous that North Korea should test a nuclear weapon at the same time as South Korea's foreign minister is elected Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"We have to read the signs and ask ourselves whether they were shutting the door on us, or whether the action of shutting the door might be seen as an attempt at drawing attention to themselves;"
"I believe the latter to be the case."
"It is for that reason that we, the Socialist Group in this House, along with the international community of social democrats, take the view that we must, despite everything, carry on with dialogue, quite simply because, at the end of the day, there is no alternative."
"Mr Solana, I think that the reactions to date have been level-headed, not least in North Korea's immediate vicinity; the Japanese government and the governments of the other neighbouring states have, I think, been appropriate."
"What is not appropriate is a policy of arrogance."
"Let me remind the House that there was a time when the United States of America, under the Clinton administration, reached agreement with North Korea on energy supply programmes."
"I would also remind the House that what was known, in the 1990s, as the Kedo programme, was not intended to appease the dictator, but - in so far as possible - to keep the regime on-side."
"The administration that succeeded Clinton's put a stop to all these efforts."
"Nor do I have any desire to conceal, or make a secret of the fact, that our group sees this as another failure on the part of the United States and an example of its unilateral approach."
"While that does not excuse what the North Korean dictator is doing, it does indicate that the only way to resolve international conflicts is to bring all the parties together."
"The last thing I have to say I say on my own account to all those who always recommend the development of nuclear energy as the solution to the problems of mankind; I would remind them that every nuclear power plant and every enrichment facility that is built becomes, in the hands of a criminal such as the North Korean dictator, something that puts the whole world at incalculable risk."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, two days ago, North Korea crossed a red line."
"The Presidency of the European Union, in its statement, strongly condemned the nuclear test, which is unacceptable."
"The Presidency signalled its willingness to work in close cooperation with the international community towards a decisive international response to this provocative act."
"The High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner confirmed and repeated this stance."
"I am very happy about that, and I welcome the statement, but we expect it to be strictly implemented."
"North Korea has always tried to negotiate using threats and intimidation."
"It has worked for them so far, but we must be clear that it will not work for them again."
"There seems to be an unprecedented international consensus on possible counter-measures against the North Korean regime."
"Let us take this opportunity to send a clear signal that we will not tolerate acts that lead to instability and that further increase tensions."
"North Korea's action is a threat to regional stability because it might trigger a regional arms race, which is highly undesirable."
"It is also a threat to the immediate security of all if North Korea succeeds in enhancing its position in the illegal arms trade with shady regimes, not to mention international terrorist organisations."
"When dealing with North Korea, we must also keep Iran in mind."
"By taking a firm stance on this matter, we also create incentives for Iran to return to the negotiating table."
"North Korea must refrain from further tests and unconditionally return to the six-party talks."
"At the same time, it must be obvious to all participants that the aim of the six-party talks is to convince North Korea to abandon its military nuclear programme and provide for its participation in the NPT regime."
"Nothing less is acceptable, and we have to achieve that now; we can be flexible on modalities and specifics, but we must be firm on the principles."
"North Korea must see that a military nuclear programme is not the way to guarantee its safety and stability."
"We have seen in the past that North Korea can be open to limited but mutually fruitful economic cooperation with its neighbours and other partners."
"The European Union and other donors have provided substantial humanitarian aid, as the Commissioner indicated a few minutes ago, and we have always been open to giving further assistance and continuing dialogue, but with conditions."
"The question is: why is North Korea turning its back on the international community now?"
"The answer is simple: the leaders of North Korea think they have nothing to lose."
"They are wrong: the price they have to pay for growing international isolation and possible sanctions will increase dramatically."
"We already know that they do not care much about the welfare of their own population, but through such irresponsible acts they risk losing international support and cooperation for a gradual opening-up of their country and for reforms without which the political and social structure of their country will inevitably collapse."
"They might understand no other argument, but they must understand this argument."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I come from a country that 'deals' in nuclear technology."
"It is therefore very hypocritical to be surprised that this danger has resurfaced when it has been spread here, there and everywhere."
"That being said, I am going to focus my speech on North Korea."
"I could not care less about whether it has nuclear technology that is genuinely fully-developed or an appropriate vehicle for such technology."
"I am one of the very few MEPs to have stayed in North Korea."
"That country is not just a harsh dictatorship that plunges its people into complete poverty: during my stay there, I also visited one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in the world."
"It must be pointed out, in fact, that millions of people living there are completely out of touch with reality, unaware of the outside world."
"Their lives consist in grovelling before a leader who tells them each morning that the entire world wants to overrun them."
"In North Korea, we are confronted with a world that would appear to be very close to that of George Orwell."
"What sanctions should be applied under these circumstances, then, when dealing with a regime that is on the fringes of what is generally accepted to be reasonable behaviour and that could not care less about its own people, since it let a million people die only a short time ago?"
"Block what when they are already cut off from the world?"
"Destroy what industry when the one they have is already in ruins?"
"Try to starve them even more?"
"That would be downright disgraceful."
"In my view, the only real card that we can play is China, China that created this regime, China that has kept it going, China - and this is a very interesting point to note - that was amongst the first, if not the first, to condemn this week's explosion."
"If we really want to be of help in this matter, I believe that we must show determination, a great deal of composure and, given that we disseminate nuclear technology, a great deal of humility, too."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, North Korea's nuclear test is, quite clearly, deserving of condemnation, for it makes the region even less stable and, like every other of its kind, exposes the people who live there to the risk of radioactive fall-out."
"It is particularly cynical of North Korea to invest money in nuclear testing that the government could instead have used to feed the country's people better, and it is good that the EU wants to carry on providing aid to this end."
"The Russian Defence Minister has said that this nuclear test makes North Korea, the de facto ninth nuclear power, joining the USA, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Israel, India and Pakistan."
"The situation must now be prevented from escalating further."
"Those now talking of the need for military strikes are dangerous warmongers."
"On the contrary, it is negotiations that will provide the solution we need, and the EU could certainly play a part in them, as indeed Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have already indicated."
"One of the North Korean government's core demands would appear to be that it should be allowed to negotiate directly with the USA."
"Why, then, should it not be possible for the USA to conduct bilateral negotiations with North Korea directly?"
"That is what the US administration must do, even if it seemingly involves a superhuman effort."
"Calling for sanctions will only make the situation worse; those who are doing that right now must explain how they propose to prevent the sanctions hitting only the North Korean people, who are starving already."
"The experience of imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan in the days when they were fledgling nuclear states shows that sanctions very rapidly run out of steam."
"The Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty was always inconsistent, but is now in serious danger; in its sixth article, the parties to it undertook - and I quote - 'to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control', which amounts to a requirement that all nuclear weapons be disposed of."
"Europeans, too, have their own obligations where nuclear weapons are concerned."
"I would remind Mr Solana that the nuclear weapons within the European Union are not held legally, contrary to what your colleague Annalisa Giannella tried to tell those of us who sit on the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"On the contrary, the EU's Member States have committed themselves, on the basis of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to nuclear disarmament, and this is where we come up against the problem of the double standards that are so characteristic of Western and EU policy."
"I ask you: what nuclear power do you know of that abides by Article 6 of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which nuclear disarmament is laid down as an obligation?"
"I can tell you that the EU Member States are doing the precise opposite, in that the United Kingdom and France are not merely failing to dispose of their nuclear weapons but are also developing new and powerful ones."
"Nuclear weapons are always criminal in nature, and the testing of them always produces misleading and dangerous results; what is interesting is the differing treatment meted out to North Korea and Iran."
"Let me spell it out: threats of military attack always have the opposite effect to that intended."
"There are no such things as good nuclear weapons; they must be got rid of everywhere, and all nuclear tests are worthy of condemnation and must be stopped."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, this nuclear test has undoubtedly been highly detrimental to stability, peace and security."
"We can, however, once again sound a warning regarding this issue and, of course, we can here and now condemn it."
"It should be said that in this situation, of course, we should voice support and appreciation to all those who have reacted speedily to the specific situation brought about by North Korea's actions."
"On the other hand, however, listening to the speeches by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana, I was not really convinced that the reasons for North Korea's actions have been thoroughly analysed."
"Certainly, we are all aware that North Korea is a totalitarian Communist state, and that consequently plain common sense is perhaps not a characteristic of that regime."
"On the other hand, however, I would just also like to ask some provocative questions that occurred to me a few days ago, reading the comments made in the media by Mr ElBaradei, head of the Atomic Energy Agency, our watchdog."
"In something that I read by him, he said that in fact double standards lie at the root of the whole problem."
"Here, the question I would like to put to our foreign ministers is whether they agree with these comments by Mr ElBaradei to the effect that the USA and the EU states conduct a hypocritical policy in relation to Israel on the one hand and to states such as Iran and North Korea on the other since, undoubtedly, Israel can possess weapons of mass destruction, Israel can have that defence system, but for other states which have not signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty such an option is forbidden."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the destabilising effects of Pyongyang's nuclear test last Monday are evident, particularly in North-East Asia, but also globally."
"We are now facing two nuclear crises: an acute one in North-Korea, and an urgent one in Iran."
"The question is whether both remain manageable without military means, and the attitude of two members of the UN Security Council, namely China and Russia, is of decisive importance in this respect."
"What importance do Beijing and Moscow still attach to the Non-Proliferation Treaty?"
"Their conduct in the Security Council will tell."
"I expect the Member States of the EU, sitting, as they do, on this high-level UN body, to insist on reminding China and Russia of their crucial responsibility in this."
"Meanwhile, what matters is that the international community should keep tabs on Pyongyang's trade activities, especially the maritime routes."
"Indeed, only last week, the North Korean regime announced that it is supplying technology, materials and nuclear weapons to other countries as it pleases."
"That sort of explicit provocation cries out for a tough response from the international community."
"It is, without a doubt, also up to the EU Member States to adopt tough sanctions that affect the North Korean leadership whilst sparing the emaciated and brainwashed people as much as possible."
"I dare say that the Council and the Commission can imagine the enormous concern in Israel surrounding the reckless North-Korean nuclear test, which, at the same time, gives the Islamic Republic of Iran enormous encouragement to follow Pyongyang down the nuclear path, probably with actual technical and material back-up from Kim Jong-Il's terror regime."
"The Council and the Commission claim to guarantee Israel's continued existence as a state;"
"I urge them to translate this into political action in this twofold nuclear crisis."
"(PL) Mr President, it is a good thing that the world is no longer divided between the Warsaw Pact and NATO."
"It is a good thing that the former states of the Soviet bloc are today united in the European Union and NATO, or are on their way to membership."
"United, Europe is stronger and in a better position to face the issue of the day - North Korean nuclear tests."
"Fortunately, today even Russia has supported the voice of the civilised world and, like us, has condemned the nuclear tests, although some terrible events have been going on there such as the murder of journalists, the latest being Anna Politkovskaya."
"North Korea is today one of the last blank spots on the map of the world as regards political, economic and democratic development."
"What is actually the problem with North Korea?"
"Perhaps it is simply trying to attract our attention, and this is a desperate cry for help."
"We are pleased to note that even China has condemned Korea's proposed arms race."
"Today, more than ever in world history, all countries want economic development and to live in peace."
"North Korea also needs food and prosperity more than it needs weapons."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, what has happened is particularly problematic and dangerous, and for two reasons."
"The first is the obvious one that a dangerous weapon has got into the hands of a dictator who is well known for his lack of concern for human life, even for the lives of his country's people, and who is, then, prepared to take any risk, even that of their being wiped out."
"This makes it extremely difficult to assess the precise degree of risk involved."
"The second point to be made is that, if this test really does turn out to be successful and has been carried out using rocket technology, the region could see a new race to acquire and deploy weapons of mass destruction."
"I do not know what debates there will be on that subject in South Korea, in Indonesia, in the Philippines or elsewhere."
"It also needs to be borne in mind that there is an exchange of rocket technology going on between North Korea and Iran."
"The Iranian Government is playing the hedgehog to our hare and it seems less and less likely that it is doing this only to secure its own peaceful use of nuclear energy - far from it, it is up to much more besides."
"You, Mr Solana, have tried unstintingly to get things on track and conduct the talks accordingly."
"There are particular dangers in this alliance, and that is why Iran is under a special responsibility to clear the decks once and for all and get stuck into some proper negotiations."
"Mr Salafranca asked what sort of sanctions we are talking about."
"We have to come up with some that really will have a serious impact on this man; if they affect the people, he will not be bothered, so what is needed is sanctions that hurt him personally, and they must be implemented and complied with."
"What I will say to Mr Pflüger is that we should not now be seeking refuge in blaming one party or another for making mistakes at one time or another; the USA is not to blame for the fact that we have a deranged dictator to deal with."
"We should ensure that this man is not given more escape routes by this House, for he is defying every rule made by the international community, and so we must compel him to return to the meetings of the Six, and, if they prove successful, he can be guaranteed security for his country, but this must be spelled out plainly if we are not to end up in 20 years' time with a world which will have 30 or 40 countries with nuclear weapons, and all set to destroy it."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, as a European Parliament, we have no choice but to associate ourselves with the universal condemnation of the nuclear tests apparently carried out by North Korea."
"Our firm condemnation should be accompanied by a commitment by the European Union and the whole international community to try at this time to find a solution to this very grave problem by negotiation."
"We must persuade this dictatorship to respect the rules of international coexistence."
"Nevertheless, the international community has no choice: we must seriously find a way to achieve non-proliferation."
"I should like to say to Mr Brok that this is not a matter of blaming anyone; but it is in my view impossible not to recognise that the weakening of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was clearly due also to the failure of the 2005 conference, was a fatal mistake."
"I therefore consider that any prospective emergency solution must be based on the resumption of the negotiations for the revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"This is an obligatory task that the international community must carry out consistently, since only thus - although in another situation - shall we have the necessary clout to impose respect for this line of conduct upon the Pyongyang dictatorship."
"It must be said that this pre-emptive Iraq war has, perversely, convinced dictators that possessing nuclear weapons is a sort of safe-conduct."
"It is our job to convince world governments, including the rulers of authoritarian states, that this is absolutely not the case: otherwise we will not halt rearmament."
"Finally, Mr Solana, I should like you to explain the differences between North Korea and Iran, since the two cases are too often associated with each other - yet I believe that there lies in the differences the details of a possible solution."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enough has been said about North Korea, but too little, I think, about how it can be an object lesson for us in Europe and for the world at large."
"When North Korea, in 1962, embarked on its nuclear programme, it was of course described as 'civil', with talk of 'atoms for peace', 'we do not want bombs' and 'we do not want weapons'."
"Not long afterwards, just as also happened with many other countries, it came to be suspected that this was not the case."
"When Pyongyang, in 2003, after a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing, admitted that it was reprocessing for military purposes, it was established that what was described as a civil nuclear programme was being misused for military ends."
"In 2005, it was reported from Pyongyang that the country was in possession of nuclear weapons, and the test was carried out at the beginning of this week."
"The only thing I can say right now is that all those who argue in favour of more widespread civil use of nuclear energy are, at the same time, ensuring that it is also used for military purposes, and repeatedly paving the way for, among other things, the war in Iraq, which was claimed to be justified by the suspicion of misuse."
"And what was the background to that?"
"The stuff had been exported to Iraq - for civilian purposes - from Europe."
"Why, then, does Iran possess the technology, allegedly for civilian use?"
"There are those who represent Europe and claim that new reactor technologies could make it possible to clamp down on the military use of nuclear energy: they are lying, they know they are lying, and they should desist from further undermining the Non-Proliferation Treaty by making civil atomic technology more widely available."
"Mr President, it is indeed chilling to think of the possible consequences of the totalitarian, Stalinist regime in North Korea now having a nuclear capacity."
"Quite apart from the opportunity for direct aggressive use, an aspect which would alarm me is that North Korea may now be in the marketplace with crazed terrorist groups for the export of nuclear devices and technology."
"North Korea is already heavily involved in, and indeed reliant upon, multiple illegal export businesses, including drugs and, especially, counterfeit currency, and this is on a massive scale."
"If it were now to be in the marketplace for selling nuclear technology, then we all have very great reason to fear, for those in the terrorist world who would seek such technology know no constraints in their lust for killing."
"I think it is a very alarming prospect that we could have rogue use by a rogue state selling nuclear technology to rogue elements."
"It behoves the EU, and more particularly the more relevant United Nations, to be extremely robust and resolute in handling this crisis."
"Mere condemnation is unlikely to be anything like enough."
"I have no doubt that severe sanctions will be required."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, by carrying out this test, North Korea has demonstrated that it cares not a whit for the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty; its political leadership has thereby presented the international community with a serious and deliberate provocation, quite heedless of the fact that it would, by carrying out this test, be imperilling the peace and security of the region and of regions beyond it, and, finally, accepting the possibility of a new nuclear arms race being triggered within and beyond Asia."
"It has also - and without any regard for its own people - taken on board the inevitability of the country being completely isolated."
"We in this European Parliament must make our position abundantly and forcefully clear."
"We must denounce in the most vigorous terms the carrying-out of this test; we must call upon North Korea's political leadership to return to the negotiating table in order to discuss the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in order to resume the six-country talks, and, ultimately, to bring about a peaceful solution to this temporary crisis."
"This House must also call upon the international community and the Security Council to respond with greater firmness than they have to date."
"It is quite simply unacceptable that the government of North Korea should use its own money and money sent to it from elsewhere to develop nuclear weapons at the same time as it relies on the world community to supply its starving population with food."
"Further to what you said earlier, Mr President, I ask you to put out a written statement setting out this House's protest to the government of North Korea, to the international community, and to the Security Council, along with the demands that it makes of them."
"We cannot accept that a second test should be carried out, thereby repeating something that was deserving of the most forthright condemnation the first time it occurred."
"Mr President, this debate is about a nuclear test by the deplorable North Korean regime."
"However, Mr Solana has stated on more than one occasion that this is only a 'possible' nuclear test."
"In order to be clear about what we are discussing, would Mr Solana reassure us that he will be able to tell us in the very near future whether in fact it has taken place?"
"Mr Matsakis, that is in no way a point of order."
"You have jumped the queue of speakers."
"I would ask you not to abuse the Rules of Procedure in order to take the floor."
"Mr President, North Korea's latest challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime is clear, and deserves to be condemned in the most forceful terms."
"We all agree on that, but we also have to find the right, smart response, directed at the authorities responsible but sparing the population."
"We should also stay focused on the ultimate objective, which is to achieve verifiable denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, as the foundation for lasting peace and stability there, given the tense armed stand-off across the demilitarised zone."
"In the end, only diplomacy can achieve this goal."
"With regard to a possible analysis of the motivation for this, I am sure the reasons are manifold."
"The fact that it is misinterpreting the stance of the international community could be a result of the regime's total isolation, but it could well also be aimed at enforcing bilateral talks, which it has not yet achieved."
"This week's developments will make it harder than ever to relaunch the six-party talks, but, in the medium to long term, this framework remains the best chance for a lasting solution."
"I therefore sincerely hope that the resumption of talks will come sooner or later, even though the outlook now is not at all promising."
"The European Union is not a direct participant in the six-party talks but, as a responsible global player with a clear stake in preserving regional stability, we have been profoundly supportive of this framework."
"We have also signalled that we stand ready to play a more active role, if the six-party talks find it useful."
"In the end, dialogue will be the answer to this very difficult, provocative situation."
"North Korea's stated objective is to increase its own security; this goal could be achieved through the six-party process, which is what we would recommend."
"Mr President, at the conclusion of this debate, there is a point which I think we have to underline."
"Not a single Member of the European Parliament has spoken out against condemnation of North Korea's behaviour."
"I think that is a very important conclusion to this important debate."
"There may be some doubts about what to do next and how to deal with North Korea in the future, but the fact that the test has been a source of concern for the international community - and that the international community has taken responsibility for addressing the issue - has been supported by all the Members who have spoken in this debate."
"I think we should be happy about that, because on issues of this nature and of this degree of importance, the responsibilities of Members of the European Parliament are on a par with those of the members of the international community."
"There are different conclusions we can draw as to why the test was carried out and what the consequences are for the future."
"Some of us have been to North Korea."
"I have been there and talked to the country's leader on several occasions."
"In Kuala Lumpur in July, I had the opportunity to talk with the Foreign Minister and he told me then that there was to be no return to the six-party talks."
"So it was almost certain by then that something of this nature might happen."
"We have to praise the Chinese, who have been leading the six-party talks and standing their ground."
"This time, however, they unfortunately failed to convince North Korea, and instead of a meeting, a nuclear test has taken place."
"I agree completely with those who have said that the Non-Proliferation Treaty should be reviewed."
"Mrs Napoletano made that point most coherently and vehemently."
"I share her concern about the fact that the last revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a failure."
"It was a failure on the part of everybody involved in the revision, including the nuclear powers, some of which are Member States of the European Union."
"The Non-Proliferation Treaty dates back to 1968."
"We have gone through five revisions already and none of them has been able to address the difficulties and loopholes involved in that Treaty."
"That must be said."
"Let us also point out, however, that North Korea is not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"It abandoned the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, and therefore is under no obligation to comply with it."
"It abandoned the Non-Proliferation Treaty because it did not want to admit inspectors, which is something that is mandatory under the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"As we are seeing today, and as we will see in the future, the Non-Proliferation Treaty needs to be revised and updated."
"As I said, the Treaty was drawn up in 1968."
"That is a long time ago in historical terms, and therefore we have to make an effort."
"The Europeans can plead that these regimes be adapted to the realities of today and not to the realities of yesterday."
"I quite agree with that."
"As far as sanctions are concerned, I do not think that the Security Council can just make a statement."
"The Security Council has to act, otherwise other countries that are watching to see how the Security Council responds will draw the conclusion that the international community does not take an act of this nature seriously."
"Remember what happened when Pakistan did it?"
"North Korea was watching for the international community's response to Pakistan's actions."
"And probably part of today's situation is a reflection of what happened then."
"That does not mean, of course, that any sanctions must target the people of North Korea, who have already suffered a great deal."
"They suffer politically, they suffer economically, they suffer in their daily lives."
"Therefore, other things have to be put in place and taken into account."
"I think the most important kinds of sanctions that should be put in place are sanctions which prevent proliferation by North Korea and prevent North Korea from passing nuclear technology on to other states which might be looking to acquire such technology so that they too can move in the same direction."
"This is probably the most important step that the United Nations Security Council can take."
"As far as diplomacy is concerned, everybody in this House will agree that diplomacy is what we like to do."
"We Europeans like to solve complex, difficult problems with what we value most: our minds, our intelligence, our diplomacy."
"And there is no doubt that this problem is indeed complex and difficult."
"Before we proceed to the next item, Mr Pflüger has requested the floor to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 145 of our Rules of Procedure."
"According to this Rule, Mr Pflüger, you may speak for three minutes, on the understanding that you may only make observations relating to opinions that have been attributed to you or correct observations that you may have made in the course of the debate."
"(DE) Mr President, further to Mr Brok's statement, in which he implied that I had laid responsibility for North Korea's nuclear test at the door of the USA, any such insinuation is utterly false."
"On the contrary, the issue - and Mrs Napoletano raised something similar - of those governments - the USA, but also, and to an increasing degree, the EU, among them - that believe they have to use nuclear weapons to defend themselves against attack is something that calls for serious discussion in this House."
"For that reason, Mr Brok is quite wrong to make that insinuation."
"Atomic warfare is threatened not only by the USA, but also by Jacques Chirac, and that is why this issue has to receive serious consideration, and why Mr Brok is wrong to imply what he did."
"I fear that Mr Brok has not been able to hear you."
"I hope that someone will pass on to him what was said."
"(DE) Mr President, if I might be permitted to make a brief comment, it has to be said that those who are ready to give it out have to be willing to take it as well."
"Mr Pflüger has made an accusation, to which I have responded, and he should accept that."
"This is a political statement rather than an insinuation."
"Mr Brok, nobody is going to take any measures against you."
"You have made a comment, and Mr Pflüger has seen fit to respond to it, but that is the end of the story."
"That concludes this item."
"Informal summit in Lahti and EU-Russia relations following the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya (debate)"
"We shall proceed to the next item on the agenda. This is the Council and Commission statements on the Preparation for the Informal Meeting of Heads of State or Government in Lahti and also, in accordance with the House's decision, relations between the European Union and Russia following the murder of Anna Politkovskaya."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank you sincerely for the opportunity to come here and discuss the informal summit of the Heads of State or Government in Lahti, to be held on 20 October."
"We decided to hold the Lahti Summit because we want to give the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union the opportunity for an open and informal debate on two themes which are important for the Union's future and for economic success: innovation and external energy relations."
"We need a firm, consistent policy on building a favourable environment for innovation and on energy issues."
"In this way we will be able to improve conditions for economic growth and employment in the Union."
"If the Union does something tangible to promote welfare and prosperity, we can also expect the Union to become more acceptable in the eyes of the people."
"A consistent common policy on energy will at the same time strengthen the Union's credibility as an international player."
"To guide the discussions at the Summit of the Heads of State or Government, two communications are being drafted by the Commission."
"One is on external energy relations, and the other is on innovation policy."
"The communications are to be released tomorrow, 12 October."
"They are not meant to be approved at the meeting, but they indicate those questions which we want to address at Lahti."
"Before the unofficial Summit at Lahti, an Informal Tripartite Social Summit will also be held on the Friday morning."
"The way in which a European job market of 200 million employees will function and adapt to change is of crucial importance for Europe's future."
"That is why the Social Partners have a vital role to play when the goal is to strengthen European competitiveness."
"Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, has been invited to the dinner following the Summit of Heads of State or Government."
"Discussions with the President are aimed at focusing on the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, including cooperation on energy."
"The immense challenges which the Union faces in issues of energy - securing its supply, climate change, continual price rises, and recent crises - have prompted the development of a common energy policy for the EU."
"With regard to securing the supply of energy, the ever-increasing dependence on energy imports is a particular challenge for the EU."
"If no action is taken, it has been estimated that this dependence will grow from the present level of 50% to 70% over the next 20 years."
"Before the Finnish presidential term started, the evolution of a common energy policy was discussed at two meetings of the European Council held at the beginning of the year."
"During the Finnish Presidency, we will focus in particular on external energy relations, and these talks will prepare the ground for a large-scale energy debate, to be held next spring, to lead to the adoption of an energy policy action plan."
"Although the Lahti talks will focus on external energy relations, obviously our objective for external relations cannot be looked at as a separate issue."
"Among all the priority areas mentioned in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, it is close contact that stands out."
"Other areas include the single market in energy, solidarity between the Member States, the diversification of energy sources, energy efficiency, renewables and innovations in the domain of energy."
"In external energy relations, the Member States need to reach a common understanding and establish a view concerning what sort of strategy should be adopted to make progress in relations with countries outside the EU, and what sort of common outward-looking goals the EU should have."
"This means that the Member States must be able to commit jointly to an agreed way forward that also covers bilateral relations, and to speak with one voice in these contexts too."
"In committing to common goals, the Union will also be better prepared to deal with changes in the world's energy markets."
"At the Lahti energy talks we will be exchanging views on how external energy relations might be developed in the immediate future."
"The discussions are intended to focus mainly on three themes."
"The first is the principles on which EU-Russian energy relations should be based, and how they should be implemented."
"The second is closer relations with strategically important third countries."
"The third is more effective gathering of data as a basis for decision-making with regard to a common energy policy."
"Russia, whose share of imports of both oil and gas is 25%, is the Union's most strategically important energy partner."
"In all strategic partnerships, including the one with Russia, it is important to find something which is in the interests of both parties in order to develop the partnership."
"The common interest in EU-Russia energy relations is obvious."
"The EU is dependent on imports of energy from Russia, and Russia needs long-term contracts for energy exports at market prices, as well as Western investment in the basic production of energy."
"Opening up the market on both sides will be a key factor."
"The talks by the EU Heads of State or Government will also prepare the ground for discussions with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, later that evening, one central theme of which is energy issues."
"The purpose is to communicate to Russia the EU's objective of a binding framework agreement on energy, which would take account of the interests of both parties, reciprocity and an impartial operational environment."
"The talks will also certainly make reference to the challenges that the EU and Russia have in common, such as energy efficiency, where both sides stand to gain."
"Extending internal energy principles to the EU's neighbouring regions, and the strategic development of relations with important third countries, are goals we must aspire to if we want to secure the supply of energy."
"80% of the world's oil resources are to be found in the regions surrounding the Union."
"There is a whole range of instruments available to improve relations with third countries."
"It includes the Neighbourhood Policy Action Programmes, the agreement on energy cooperation, bilateral agreements and regional ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker due to technical problems)"
"Energy policy must be one key element in the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The European Union needs enough information to practise a more coherent energy policy."
"In addition, it must be able to respond to external problem situations and crises connected with energy."
"The Union should establish a system which will help bolster cooperation between the Member States and the institutions, and enhance solidarity in issues connected with energy."
"The other main topic of the Summit of Heads of State or Government is the development of a policy on innovation."
"It must be possible to improve the way in which research work done in Europe is exploited in the shape of commercial goods and services."
"Moreover, the Union must be able to introduce new technology as efficiently as they do in the countries that are our competitors. If we stick with the way we do things now, the innovation gulf between us and our major trading partners will only grow."
"Production, mainly in the growing economies, is in ever greater competition with Europe, not only in industry but also in the service sectors."
"China and India train highly educated people for the job market far more than is the case in the EU."
"The markets in the growing economies, however, also mean that there is a huge potential for exports from the Union."
"Success can come just from an ability to create something new - in other words, innovation."
"In an open market, the best commodities succeed."
"It is impossible to stay ahead unless there is continued investment in research and product development."
"The Member States of the Union are committed to increasing future investment in research and development by virtue of the decisions taken earlier on."
"It is nevertheless vitally important to ensure that Europe can make good use of investment so that research work leads to new, better and commercially exploitable goods and services."
"The intention at the Lahti Summit is to mention issues and challenges which call for joint action on the part of the Union."
"The aim is to create an environment where innovations can emerge and be adopted efficiently."
"In its position on the Lisbon Strategy, the European Parliament has also highlighted the importance of a policy on innovation."
"To support effective innovation, there would need to be created an EU-wide strategy on immaterial rights."
"Immaterial rights are of major importance for a company's success and competitiveness."
"One fundamental question, for example, is the quality of patents, which is a basic principle for a workable, reliable patents system."
"The Presidency believes that Europe must have a cost-effective patents system, but one which adheres to the notion of quality, regardless of the choice of alternative that will form the basis for developing this system."
"If we can develop the patents system further, companies will be guaranteed considerable savings on the costs of patents, which can only encourage innovation and research in Europe."
"Improved collaboration between universities and the business world is a precondition of a successful policy on innovation."
"The intention is to create a new network-based European Institute of Technology, and the Commission will be putting forward a proposal on this next week."
"The partnership project between science, business and training will be characterised by excellence."
"The priority will be the promotion of innovation."
"The Presidency believes that the European Institute of Technology will allow Europe to exploit existing opportunities in companies and the scientific community more effectively."
"Furthermore, cooperation between the private and public sector needs to be stepped up in order to promote competitiveness."
"Europe has seen the creation of the so-called Technology Platforms, company-based strategic research initiatives, which are excellent examples of partnership between the public and private sectors."
"To their credit, companies have indicated their willingness to invest in their selected platforms, and a similar commitment is now needed from public bodies financing research."
"It is very important for innovation for the creation of European standards to be speeded up."
"Without a common European standard, many innovations can remain unrealised."
"Where, for example, would the European mobile phone market have been without the GSM standard?"
"The creation of pan-European technical norms for mobile phones in practice made it possible for the world's leading player in this sector to come from Europe."
"On the other hand, if national standards alone had been adopted as a basis for developing mobile phones, there would not have been the same sort of major, geographically huge success."
"The speedy adoption of open, compatible standards is one of the keys to success in business."
"It will also have clear benefits for the consumer."
"At the same time, it will strengthen our competitive status and be a response to rapid technological development, so that the technical development solutions realised in Europe can genuinely compete with development work done elsewhere in the world."
"Moving on, illegal immigration is a problem that affects the whole of the European Union."
"That is why we need to find solutions together."
"Solidarity is at its most conspicuous in the effective implementation of concrete measures."
"At the Lahti Summit we will be discussing illegal immigration, which has become a particular problem in the Mediterranean and the southern parts of the Union."
"For us, it is important that the Union can establish a comprehensive, effective policy on immigration control, one which takes account of issues relating to both illegal and legal immigration, including integration."
"We must use the existing instruments effectively and think of new ways to support countries of origin and transit in their efforts to prevent illegal immigration."
"Immigration issues have been on the agenda at all the Justice and Home Affairs Councils."
"The matter is also to be discussed next week at the informal dinner of the Ministers for Development Co-operation."
"The intention too is that the work of the Justice and Home Affairs Councils should serve as a basis for decisions for the European Council in December which could help the European Union to respond effectively to the problem of illegal immigration."
"At a working lunch in Lahti, the serious situation in Sudan and Darfur will also be addressed."
"As I said at the beginning, following the informal summit of EU Heads of State or Government, the participants will dine in Lahti with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin."
"This will be an excellent opportunity for an informal discussion on the development of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia."
"The spectrum of our association is very broad, and it contains elements which could serve to develop the partnership further."
"An example of this is international issues."
"The international policy agenda this autumn includes matters where cooperation between us is very important, such as the Middle East, Iran and Kosovo."
"Energy is an important element in the strategic partnership, and we are expecting to hear President Putin's assessment of developments in his country's energy sector and the energy partnership between the Union and Russia."
"Mr President, we were all shocked to hear the news about the death of the well-known journalist and defender of freedom of expression, Anna Politkovskaja."
"We are calling for a thorough investigation into this horrendous crime and for its perpetrators to be brought to justice, something which is of particular importance for Russia's progress towards the rule of law."
"Not only is Politkovskaja's death an appalling incident and a loss for her next of kin, but it is also a setback for freedom of speech in Russia."
"Furthermore, the frank and robust talks that are going on between the European Union and Russia against this background of recent events are a valuable exercise."
"As I have already said, the strategic partnership is a framework within which all the important issues will be discussed."
"Mr President, the informal European Council next week comes at a good time."
"I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency, Prime Minister Vanhanen and all his team for their very important contribution."
"Since the Minister made such a comprehensive presentation on behalf of the Presidency, I will focus on innovation, energy policy and immigration."
"I will also make a few remarks about relations between the European Union and Russia."
"These are all issues in respect of which the challenges we face require not just a national response, but a European response; challenges which show why, more than ever, a strong European Union is necessary, and why we need the Union to equip Europeans for globalisation."
"I welcome the Presidency's decision to focus on innovation."
"Finland is a prime example of how innovation can boost economic growth."
"However, it is more than that."
"It is only by unlocking people's imaginations that we can tackle the major issues facing us today, such as climate change, social exclusion, demographic change and unemployment."
"Even though I know you know the figures, they are worth repeating."
"European Union spending on research is equivalent to 1.9% of its GDP, whereas the United States currently spends 3% of its GDP."
"It is indicative that most of the recent Nobel Prize winners come from or work in the United States."
"In Europe about half of all researchers are employed by business."
"In the United States, that figure stands at over 80%."
"The truth is that Europe is falling behind in terms of innovation and research."
"The status quo is not an option: we need to do more in this matter."
"We urgently need a strategic approach which focuses on each link in the innovation chain, from the birth of new ideas and knowledge right through to their exploitation and marketing in the economic sphere."
"The communication which the Commission will present at the informal summit in Lahti sets out such an approach."
"It pinpoints the weak links in the chain and puts forward solutions."
"We need financing, we need the right intellectual property framework to bring the right rewards and we need to tackle obstacles to innovation sector by sector."
"Above all, we need to start with a strong political message of commitment: innovation deserves encouragement, and we need a European approach for it."
"Size matters on this issue."
"One of the big differences between us and the United States is that we have no pan-European institutions for innovation and research."
"The United States is much more committed to a real global approach."
"There are great institutions supporting innovation throughout the United States, not just in one or two states."
"Until now, we had nothing in Europe."
"Now we have the European Research Council and we are proposing the establishment of a European institute of technology."
"We are proposing a network system to lend a real European dimension and a real European mission to those institutions."
"That is why we are insisting on this approach."
"That is the importance of the European institute of technology."
"It will bring the private and public sectors closer together for cutting-edge research, become a centre of international excellence, bring together the top brains, provide a stream of top class PhDs and promote spin-offs of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In short, it can become a symbol of Europe's ability to work together and innovate."
"We have been developing the finer details of the EIT over recent months and we will bring forward a detailed proposal next week."
"I am confident that the Heads of State and Government and the parliamentarians here in the European Parliament will look at it in the spirit in which it is designed: yes, it is something a little different, but something which can provide an example of Europe taking a fresh direction and finding new ways to work together."
"One of the fields in which I think we as European leaders can give a mission to a European institute of technology is that of energy and climate change."
"When we have a problem that we need help to solve, we should ask the best scientists, the best brains on our continent."
"Energy is one of the most important challenges we have today."
"Let me now turn to the issue of energy and let me make it plain: we need to create a truly European energy policy, not 25 energy policies."
"It is absurd in the 21st century to go on with 25 or 27 energy policies."
"We need a truly European energy policy."
"The problems we face - high energy prices, climate change, increasing dependence on imported hydrocarbons - are global and European problems."
"They need European solutions."
"National solutions will not be enough."
"At Hampton Court last year, European Union leaders agreed to develop a common approach."
"In our Green Paper of March 2006, the Commission defined clear objectives for a European energy policy, long-term sustainability, security of energy supply and economic competitiveness."
"The Member States have endorsed our approach, and the reaction from stakeholders to our Green Paper has been overwhelmingly positive."
"The next step is a strategic energy review which the Commission will propose at the very beginning of next year."
"I look forward to reading the European Parliament's report on it."
"It is obvious that we need coherence between the internal and external aspects of energy policy."
"We clearly need an effective internal market in energy."
"Having 25 or 27 different energy mini-markets is not the answer to the European energy challenges."
"However, we must link internal and external policy."
"Our paper for Lahti will look at the three external challenges: Russia, which I will return to; developing our energy relations with our neighbours; and creating a network to deal with external energy shocks."
"It is essential to build up energy cooperation with strategically important supply and transit countries."
"This is already happening with initiatives such as the new Energy Community Treaty and the memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation with Ukraine."
"We need to extend the principles of the internal energy market gradually throughout our neighbourhood."
"We also need to join the different areas of expertise which exist around Europe to create a more effective network to deal with external energy shocks."
"Of course, in the medium term, the best way to cope with energy shocks is through diversity: diversity of energy sources, of country of origin and of country of transit."
"Indeed, we need to mainstream energy to make it a major focus of our relations with partners worldwide."
"Finally, energy efficiency is another crucial element of this strategy."
"I can announce to you today that next week Commissioner Piebalgs - the Commissioner for Energy - and I will propose an ambitious action plan to fulfil our commitment to save 20% of primary energy use by 2020."
"Naturally, with 25% of the oil and gas consumed in the European Union coming from Russia, energy cooperation with Russia is crucial."
"The President-in-Office of the Council just explained why it is important."
"We must have a reinforced energy partnership with Russia."
"Such a partnership must be based on reciprocity, transparency, non-discrimination and openness to competition, including a level playing field for upstream and downstream investment."
"This is the only way to have a stable and secure platform for our energy relationship."
"The meeting with President Putin will be a chance to deliver a clear and hopefully coherent message from European Union leaders."
"We see three long-term objectives in our relations with Russia: we want to see a functioning democracy and market economy in which Russia lives up to the international commitments it has undertaken; we want to see a broad and strategic EU-Russia relationship based on interdependence - Russia needs the European Union and the European Union also needs Russia - and we want to enhance our cooperation with Russia on international issues."
"When we talk about effective multilateralism, this is what we mean."
"We have set our goal of a wide-ranging agreement to follow the current partnership and cooperation agreement."
"There are mutual benefits to be realised in areas such as investment and market-opening, as well as in energy and energy efficiency."
"We both have so much to gain from a real partnership."
"I also take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy with the family of Anna Politkovskaya, who was so brutally murdered last week."
"I want to pay tribute to her relentless pursuit of truth."
"She was a great defender of freedom of expression in Russia."
"(Applause)"
"I sincerely hope that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will be found and brought to justice."
"Another point we are going to address is that of immigration."
"The massive arrival of illegal immigrants at the frontiers of the European Union's southern Member States is a European problem that requires a European solution."
"In November 2006, the Commission presented a communication with a series of practical proposals for the European Union to respond to this challenge."
"On that basis, the European Council adopted a global approach to migration, outlining in detail how to respond in its internal and external policies."
"In less than a year we have seen the start of a lot of practical action: joint operations in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic under the coordination of the borders agency, Frontex; enhanced cooperation among the law-enforcement services of the Member States; better coordination of the work of the immigration liaison offices in Africa; and dialogue with key African countries of origin and transit, both bilaterally and multilaterally."
"For the first time, Member States are working together in joint operations protecting the European Union's external borders under the coordination of Frontex."
"However, let us be frank: it is not enough; much more is needed to tackle the illegal flows effectively."
"In order to strengthen the European Union's response capacity, it is of the utmost importance that all Member States of the Union work together in a spirit of solidarity, not least to assist those Member States that are, let us say, in the front line."
"With a view to the informal European Council to be held in Lahti on 20 October, I have written personally to the Heads of State and Government underlining the need for such solidarity."
"Of course, the ideal would be to have already established the Community instruments, but we have not got them yet."
"Of course, the ideal would be to have a European migration policy."
"It is absurd to have 25 or 27 migration policies in an area in which people can move around freely, because decisions taken by one country have a direct effect on the other countries."
"But before we have a true Community method to tackle these issues, we at least expect Member States to cooperate well among themselves."
"(Applause)"
"We believe this is also a practical example of European solidarity."
"We also need to work much more intensively with the countries of origin and transit."
"The implementation of the action plan agreed in Rabat in July is a key priority."
"The Commission will work hard to ensure proper implementation in close partnership with the countries concerned."
"Let us also be frank about this."
"Security matters are not enough."
"The solution to this problem will come only with our support for sustainable development in Africa."
"By the way, I think we have to engage in a high-level dialogue with African countries."
"Is it not strange that the European Union has dialogue with Asia and Latin America at the level of Heads of State and Government, but not with Africa?"
"Is it not about time now for Europe to make a commitment to establishing a high-level dialogue with Africa?"
"I believe we have the right and the duty to do so."
"That was the message I took recently to our counterparts in the African Union Commission in Addis Ababa."
"That is why we are also actively engaged - via our cooperation with our African partners - in looking collectively at this issue."
"In European terms, we also need a European Union decision-making process."
"When there are urgent and serious problems, the European Union needs to be able to react appropriately."
"This means using the bridging clause in Article 67 of the Treaty."
"We cannot deny ourselves the means to deliver effective action."
"To conclude, the informal European Council meeting in Lahti provides a good opportunity to take stock of the current European Union actions in the fields I have outlined and in several other fields as well."
"We are looking for a renewed commitment from the Heads of State and Government to deliver solutions to the real and pressing problems of the citizens of the European Union, and to deliver a Europe of results so that we can have more confidence to solve some of the very important problems in our Union."
"Let me give you a final thought."
"A week ago I was in Darfur."
"Amidst the terrible conditions experienced by the people there, I saw something that I resolved to tell my friends back in Brussels: in the NGOs and other humanitarian organisations, there are so many young Europeans, so far from their homes, putting their lives at risk every day to help Africans."
"This is the kind of Europe of which I think we should be proud; a Europe that is ready to deliver solidarity and help, showing great courage."
"That is the kind of Europe I believe we all want: an open, outward-looking, generous Europe."
"That is the Europe we should strive for."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, Mr Barroso, we are deeply distressed and outraged by the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya, and we have many questions about the reasons that led to this crime being carried out."
"It is vital that the Russian authorities get right to the bottom of this tragedy as soon as possible, and we expect the Council to send out the message that it will stand firm in the face of this fresh blow to a profession that pays a heavy cost each year for carrying out its work."
"Allow me to pay tribute, through Anna Politkovskaya, to all of the journalists who risk their lives throughout the world in order to defend freedom of expression, to which we are so attached."
"The Informal Meeting to be held in Lahti on 20 October will provide another opportunity to raise some recurring issues, such as competitiveness, innovation, immigration and energy policy."
"I fear that competitiveness and innovation will meet the same fate as sustainable development: everyone talks about it, everyone subscribes to it, but when it comes to taking concrete action, good principles go out the window."
"There are numerous examples of this."
"I could cite that of Galileo, the usefulness of which was so highly praised, but when it came to planning the budget for it, all of a sudden it was no longer a priority."
"With regard to transport infrastructure and rail links, we recommend their being completed for the sake of competitiveness, but we sacrifice them on the budgetary altar."
"What can be said about the much-hyped ambitions in relation to research when it is clear what kind of support is actually given to innovation?"
"I am thinking not only about financial aid, but also about the application of the laws that encourage investment in Europe and that clear the way for our SMEs to export outside European territory."
"I therefore expect a great deal from the Council's commitment to the European Institute of Technology, to which our President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, is, I know, very attached, as, I might add, is our Parliament."
"Indeed, it is no longer strong commitments that we expect from the Council, but concrete action."
"Competitiveness is also the outcome of the regulations that we adopt, which must represent opportunities and not constraints."
"I expect the European Commission to take these principles as its starting point when it presents its 2007 legislative programme and the Council to follow that trend."
"I expect Parliament to have the courage to reject proposals that only deal with big ideas without doing anything specific with them."
"Policies, too, must be competitive, and thus effective."
"Competitiveness also means striking a trade balance worldwide."
"Anti-dumping measures are certainly along these lines, but could we not have other strong political decisions, such as a demand for equivalent quality standards for all goods imported into the European Union?"
"Finally, on the energy issue, I hope that the discussions with President Putin will enable Europe to implement all of the structures necessary to guarantee the independence of its energy supply."
"It must also be able to equip itself with renewable energy sources so as to guarantee the independence of its energy supply from a nuclear energy perspective."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and to you, Mr President of the Commission, for your very exhaustive description of what you intend to discuss at the informal summit."
"As so often happens when summits are in the offing, we have high hopes of this one."
"Mrs Lehtomäki and Mr Barroso have told us marvellous things about innovation, immigration, energy policy, the partnership with Russia, and about Darfur."
"The whole range of our concerns has been put before us in no more than some forty minutes, and I now find it difficult to respond to all these things with the necessary brevity."
"If, after the summit, we get a forty-minute summary of what happened there that is just as closely packed with achievements and decisions reached, then I will be a happy man, but I have, at the back of my mind, the fear that we will have the same experience that we almost always have, for we are good at describing our problems, but find solving them a bit more difficult."
"The President of the Commission is right to say that investment in innovation is indispensable, not only here, but in all the Member States, and particularly in researching and developing energy-efficient technology."
"One of the crucial long-term decisions we will have to take over the coming years has to do with the question of whether achieving greater energy efficiency will enable us to cope with the exponential growth in demand for energy around the world."
"It is worthy of note that enhanced energy efficiency also involves us abandoning an economy founded on extravagance by means of such things as technological developments and investment in research that helps to ensure that the products we are able to develop reduce energy consumption rather than increasing it."
"Europe is the continent that must lead, and give good example, in this area, and that is why you are quite right to say that our policy on innovation must give priority to innovation in energy."
"My second point is that both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council are right to highlight immigration as a problem we must get on top of, but the way in which this problem is currently being addressed does nothing to solve it, and I am much obliged to Mr Barroso for describing that so graphically."
"I do not want to go over again what others have rightly pointed out, namely that sustainable development in what we call the Third World addresses the causes of the immigration problem, but the external borders in southern and eastern Europe are external borders in which we all share; those who manage to enter our territory are free to move anywhere within the Schengen area."
"Member States cannot then say that they are going to arrange these matters for themselves or that the most they will do is to address them at the intergovernmental level, but that they will not allow any of their powers to be transferred to Brussels, and that I say not least for the benefit of my own country's government, with which you, Mr Barroso, met today."
"Germany too must understand that this sort of thing is just not on; this is a lesson that must be learned, even by the German minister of the interior."
"Let me add something to what has been said about our policy on Russia."
"The policy that we, together with Russia, are currently engaged in adopting will be the basis for a renewable cooperation agreement with that country."
"It is obvious that discussions such as that we are having today, in relation to the case of Anna Politkovskaya, will always be emotional affairs."
"Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for example, who is listening to me with such attentiveness, is one of those who always get particularly worked up by anything to do with Russia, and so what I have to say, I say not least to him."
"Is there not a great deal going on in Russia that is not to our liking?"
"To be sure, we want - as you have said - a functioning democracy and market economy to prevail in Russia, but there is one thing about which we must not be in doubt."
"Quite apart from the issue of whether we are further entrenching or extending Russian democracy, Russia is - even as it is constituted today - an indispensable strategic partner for the European Union."
"So let me say that we must indeed talk about the state of democracy in Russia, but we cannot talk down to that country in a lofty and schoolmasterly way."
"It has to be clear to us that Russia will, without a doubt, be needed as a partner in energy policy, and above all as a partner in the resolution of conflicts around the globe - be they in Iran, in the Middle East or anywhere else - and that it will try to cooperate as our equal and with equal rights, and that equal status is something that we must concede to Russia just as we do to all our other partners."
"So, then, while I regard dialogue about democracy as indispensable, it must be founded on a realistic assessment of the situation."
"I much appreciate the President of the Commission's reference to Darfur."
"What that situation shows - and not for the first time - is how vital it is that the European Union, by being the peacemaker that it is, brings people together across religious, ethnic and national boundaries, and, by means of that integration, fosters peace."
"That is something for the export market, and if you let the wider world have it, that is something to be welcomed."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Madam President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats wish you well for Lahti."
"A Presidency in the second half of the year is never easy, and informal talks with 25 Heads of Government round a table are difficult to imagine."
"I bet you cannot even fit them all into one sauna!"
"On your agenda there will be important matters as diverse as energy, innovation and migration, although, as you say, the real story will be entertaining the President of the Russian Federation."
"We believe that the Member States must stand foursquare behind the Union flag in condemning attacks on freedom and private property in a country where one more candle of independent thought has just been extinguished."
"Mr Putin has clearly studied Machiavelli's dictum: 'Princes who have achieved great things have been those who have given their word lightly, who have known how to trick men with their cunning and who have overcome those abiding by honest principles.'"
"While President Putin concedes that his country is tarnished by the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, he fails to add that 40 other journalists have been murdered in his country in recent years."
"(Applause)"
"Liberals and Democrats pay tribute to Anna Politkovskaya."
"Among her criticisms of the state of freedom and democracy in Russia, she wrote, in a book called Putin's Russia: Life in a failing democracy, 'Yes, stability has come to Russia."
"It is a monstrous stability under which nobody seeks justice in law courts, which flaunt their subservience and partisanship, nobody in his or her right mind seeks protection from the institutions entrusted with maintaining law and order because they are totally corrupt."
"Lynch law is the order of the day."
"The President himself,' she continues, 'has set an example by wrecking our major oil company, YUKOS, after having jailed its chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky."
"Putin considered Khodorkovsky to have slighted him personally, so he retaliated.'"
"Madam President-in-Office, Russia needs the European Union just as much as the European Union needs Russia."
"They need our market for oil and gas."
"We are their biggest customer."
"So let our Heads of State and Government talk to Mr Putin about oil and gas, but do not have them mince their words about an increasingly dictatorial regime."
"Let them also prepare for life without dependency on Russia through joined-up thinking on energy and the environment."
"In a week in which Al Gore has promoted his film on the 'inconvenient truth' of climate change, our energy policy must in any case reflect an urgent need for a change of direction."
"Lahti is a follow-up to Hampton Court a year ago, where leaders approved plans to create a European energy market, raise competitiveness and educational levels and tackle the growing pressure of migration."
"In the past 12 months, the urgency for action in all those areas has increased."
"The Commission has rightly identified the needs, but Member States continue to deny the means."
"The Commission proposes a genuine internal market in energy, unbundling networks as we did with telecoms, creating an observatory to monitor stocks, developing a more sustainable energy mix, making energy savings."
"We welcome these proposals, but we need the Council to get on with them."
"Mr Barroso wants a European institute for technology."
"Get on with it, if you can raise the money!"
"Migration is presented, on the one hand, with data showing we need to encourage migration of labour and skills, and, on the other, with media headlines stoking populist fears of uninvited guest workers taking away jobs and benefits."
"To succeed the Council must act effectively, for which it needs the provisions of the Article 43 'bridging clause'."
"I hope the Finnish Presidency will continue to press for this."
"We support the Finnish Presidency and its modest and pragmatic approach to EU business."
"However, Madam President-in-Office, we fear you are being eclipsed already by the forthcoming German Presidency."
"Issues are being postponed; foreign leaders are courting Mrs Merkel."
"The German Foreign Ministry is taking the lead."
"Let us not raise excessively high expectations of what Germany can deliver, nor lower our expectations of what the Finnish Presidency can achieve."
"The Presidency needs to show that, in the words of the Monty Python song, 'Finland has it all'!"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Anna Politkovskaya, visited this House on two occasions, at the invitation of our group, to report to us on the situation in Chechnya and the state of play as regards freedom of speech in Russia."
"I really do think it is high time that we named names."
"Someone said that the guilty parties should be condemned; well, you will be dining with one of them tonight - with President Putin himself."
"Let us make an end of this constant self-deception;"
"Russia is at present subject to a system engaged in the day-by-day curtailment of freedom of opinion, with newspapers being bought up and then disappearing from the scene, and their owners thrown into jail."
"That is going on day in and day out."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Schulz is right; we do indeed need Russia, but we have to be aware of the fact that the Russia with which we have to deal is a Russia that does not shrink back from taking people out of circulation, and I can predict how its story is going to turn out, for it has already been written down in a book that is about to come out, entitled 'The Day of the Opritschnik' by Vladimir Sorokin, and I urge you to read it."
"In it, the author describes, from the point of view of an officer in the security services, the things that go on in Russia today, and we will read it: we will read about how some small-time crook, some small-time drug pusher gets caught, gets sentenced to 'life', gets taken off to some prison on the other side of the Urals, and then they will say, 'Look, we've caught one!'"
"As for those, though, at whose behest the crime was committed, those who gave the money - as we have seen with the forty other journalists and the newspapers - well, nobody will ask, because nobody will be interested, for - as we saw yesterday evening on German television when Chancellor Merkel met him - we need Vladimir Putin."
"And why do we need Vladimir Putin?"
"We need him because we - by which I mean Germany, with its Grand Coalition of red and green that has entered into an impossible treaty with Russia and avoided the Europeanisation of energy policy - because we have established a link with Russia."
"Even so, names do need to be named, and then, perhaps, we might get somewhere."
"Yes, of course there have to be negotiations with Russia, but I am firmly convinced that now - yet again - is the time for us to display the necessary attitude; yes, of course we can laugh when Schalke 04 is bought by Gazprom, when Chelsea is bought by Roman Abramovich; all these things we can find amusing, just as we think it is terrific that Mr Putin is with us everywhere and turns up to watch Federal League matches every Saturday; the only problem is that the price we are paying is the price that the people of Russia have paid and the price that the people of Chechnya have paid, namely the price that you pay for doing no more than cohabiting with one of the most dangerously oppressive systems, smiling sweetly at it and otherwise looking the other way."
"I find it simply shameful that we look the other way."
"We say how appalled we are, and then we come back down to earth and say, 'Oh, Vladimir, do you think you have a problem?"
"What makes you do these things?"
"But it is good that you are paying your bills more promptly.'"
"So that is all right, then."
"That is our attitude."
"All I can say, by way of summary, is that we will resolve the energy issues, the immigration issue, and all the other issues only if - and this is where Mr Watson has got it right - we, at some point, speak frankly about what the problems are and say honestly about what we will or will not do."
"We must, I think, negotiate with Putin, but that does not mean that we have to dine with him like mates together."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Madam President, Minister Lehtomäki, the Finnish government wanted to hold an EU summit in Finland, probably with the purpose of spreading the glad tidings of Finland's excellent competitiveness to others."
"The passage of time has brought other matters to the agenda, and, to Finland's delight, the Russian President will be attending the evening meal organised for the Heads of State or Government."
"The matter of investigating the murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaja should then be raised as a test that the rule of law in Russia actually works."
"(Applause)"
"In the name of the new liberalism, the EU's right-wing forces want to break and crush good educational systems and the good social security system."
"I call on the Finnish government to tell these EU new liberals that public services are the secret of Finland's excellent competitiveness."
"Please tell them too that the advanced liberalisation of the electricity markets in the Nordic countries has raised the price of electricity, and that the state, and not the market, has to take responsibility for energy security."
"Do not harp on about the Lisbon objectives."
"The EU will not be the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"An economy built on dreams reminds one of Mr Khrushchev, who 50 years ago in the UN promised that the Soviet Union would surpass the standard of living in the United States of America within 10 years."
"Our group fails to understand the move by the Finnish Government to ratify the defunct EU Constitution in Finland."
"To my government, I would say this: you are up against alien forces, the same way you were when you insisted that the EU should decide on a common penal code with a qualified majority."
"That way, you would be wiping out the historical memory of nations."
"I send my greetings to the Prime Minster, Mrs Lehtomäki."
"Hold your head high for the rest of the presidential term."
"You could even try to think for yourself sometimes, instead of always being a kind of warm-up act for the next presidency, a far bigger one than Finland."
"To Mr Barroso, I would say that in several cases there is no proper legal basis for implementing his very ambitious ideas, although there is certainly room in the world for ambitious ideas."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the President-in-Office and President Barroso for their presentations here today."
"I will deal with the easy questions first of all and then go on to the more difficult ones facing the summit."
"We have a right to tell the Russians that we demand standards of them with regard to freedom of expression, freedom of accountability and the freedom and the security of human life when people question and challenge authority."
"As Mr Watson rightly said, 40 journalists have been killed in Russia in the last two and a half years."
"Interestingly enough, not one person has been arrested in connection with those 40 deaths; not one person has been convicted in connection with those 40 deaths."
"If we are to expect that suddenly action will be taken because of the horrific gunning-down of Anna Politkovskaya in recent days, I think we are like ostriches sticking our heads in the sand."
"Only when real engagement and dialogue takes place with Russia can we guarantee a relationship of equality between the EU and Russia, despite our dependence on Russia for energy, despite Russia's dependence on us for markets, and despite the interaction that there is in geopolitical terms between eastern Europe and Russia."
"I think that what we really have to do is show courage now in laying down clear standards and guidelines of what we expect from our partners with regard to their relationships."
"This is not just about the death of the journalist, horrific as that is; it is not just about Chechnya; it is also about Russian treatment of Georgia in the recent past and what they have done."
"While the Russian authorities condemn Chechen resistance fighters on the one hand, on the other hand they support 'resistance fighters' in parts of Georgia."
"They have put the economy of Georgia under tremendous strain, not just in economic terms but also in human terms, deporting hundreds of thousands of Georgians from Russia back to their home country, denying them access to education and to businesses which they legitimately own and control within Russia."
"All for the sake of 'clarification'."
"My next point touches upon the European institute for technology, research and development and what is required for that."
"I am a great supporter of President Barroso's plan with regard to the necessity for Europe to take the lead and take the leap from the 20th century into the 22nd century with regard to what we need to do for research and development and investment in technology."
"But first, before that can happen, we must ensure that the intellectual property rights and patenting rights are protected to allow for innovation to take place, to allow for investments to be made."
"It is easy to build the structure of a building to house an institute of technology."
"It is more difficult to put in place the legislative framework to allow for this to happen."
"Finally, Madam President - if I may be allowed the same latitude as the other group chairmen were allowed - when we speak about energy and common energy policy and energy needs, one of the biggest opportunities that we are denying ourselves is the renewable energy that we can create and grow on our land."
"When farmers are suffering because of bad deals made by Peter Mandelson at the WTO talks, or when agriculture is under threat, then we need to invest in renewable energy."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Madam President, Anna Politkovskaja's Danish friend cannot obtain a visa for Russia, and I have asked Mr Solana to raise this matter at a suitable opportunity."
"I turn now to the Finnish Presidency."
"I love Finland."
"I sit on chairs, and put flowers in vases designed by Alvar Aalto and use a Nokia phone."
"I have had respect for Finnish politicians ever since I was a young man and I have cooperated with your foreign minister in the EEA and with your prime minister in the Convention."
"Now, I have to ask with some dismay: what has happened to Finland?"
"How on earth can Finnish politicians persuade themselves to ratify a Constitution that has been rejected in France and the Netherlands and therefore no longer exists?"
"Is it true that it is members of the Centre party's parliamentary group who are to vote against their own conviction?"
"The great majority of Finnish voters are opposed to the Constitution, yet you force it through without a referendum."
"Shame on you!"
"Instead of submitting to Mr Vanhanen's whip and adopting a new policy of Finlandisation whereby Finland turns itself into Germany's seventeenth state, you should start afresh with a new directly elected Convention, referendums in all the countries and a document that the electorate can happily vote for."
"Finland currently has 7.8% of the votes necessary for achieving a blocking minority in the Council of Ministers, so the other countries are obliged to listen to Finland."
"That is precisely why we have a valuable culture of consensus in the Council of Ministers."
"The Constitution would introduce double majority voting, with the result that we should be voting on the basis of population figures."
"That would cause the Finnish portion of a blocking minority to fall from 7.8% to 3.3%, so there would no longer be any need to listen to Finland and other small EU countries."
"The German share of the vote would correspondingly increase from 32% to 51%."
"Germany and Turkey would thus be able to determine the speed at which an enlarged EU developed."
"A double majority would destroy the EU's culture of consensus, and the removal of the national Commissioners would make it difficult to get the EU to operate properly on a day-to-day basis."
"Nokia would no doubt get by, but the many small and medium-sized companies and local authorities would miss having contact through the Finnish cabinet when there was no longer a Finnish Commissioner at the table."
"Moreover, the rotation system would only, of course, continue until, true enough, the turn of the wheel replaced France with Malta."
"Stick to one Commissioner for each Member State and to the culture of consensus in the Council of Ministers instead of adopting the rejected draft Constitutional Treaty."
"(NL) Madam President, as has already been said, the European Heads of State or Government will, when they meet in Lahti on 20 October, also be broaching the subject of immigration."
"The question is, however, what conclusions they will draw."
"Two weeks ago, yet another tragedy struck before the European coasts, involving ill-fated asylum seekers."
"Yet again, the blame rests with unscrupulous traffickers prepared to take huge amounts of money off people in order to bring them to Europe in search of their fortune."
"Yet again, the capsizing of a vessel of illegals off the coast of Lampedusa claimed casualties; the bulk of passengers and crew could only just be saved."
"In order to prevent such tragedies from happening again - off Lampedusa, off the Canary Islands and anywhere along our external borders - Europe has to send out clear signals, for desperate times call for desperate measures."
"We must come down hard on people-traffickers."
"The penalties cannot be tough enough."
"This should go hand in hand with a strict asylum policy, one that demonstrates to the rest of the world that Europe is serious about protecting its borders."
"That is why I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Swiss on the sensible choice they have made in all their cantons to tighten up legal conditions for immigration and asylum, because, paradoxically, in these matters, firm, humane and fair policy is the best way."
"I should therefore like to express the hope that the European Heads of State or Government, at the informal Lahti summit, will ponder the Swiss example, for Europe must learn to listen to its people where major social issues are concerned."
"We have, for example, seen the arrogance with which the eurocracy wants to persevere with a constitution that was rejected by the bulk of the people, such as in France and the Netherlands."
"When the people have their say, their opinions are often wholly incompatible with the decisions taken over their heads by an elite unfamiliar with the real world."
"This is without a doubt also the case for the pressing issue of immigration."
"Madam President, I think the best way to honour Anna Politkovskaya's work is to read her book Putin's Russia, as Mr Watson has indicated."
"We need to be aware that systematic intimidation, harassment and murder of independent journalists, as well as the lack of any results from any investigations, have created a climate of impunity in which killers seem not to fear the law."
"Such a trend is seriously damaging to Russia's reputation as a Council of Europe Presidency State."
"It also casts doubt on our common values."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Presidency of the EU Council to raise this issue at the forthcoming Lahti summit."
"The PPE-DE Group also calls on the Commission and the EU Member States to take a principled stand in insisting on the restoration of the freedom of the press and respect for independent journalists as among the main prerequisites for renewing the PCA agreement next year."
"Only when the EU sends a clear signal that we value the life of this courageous woman not less than oil and gas will things start to change in Russia."
"(Applause)"
"The only way truly to honour Anna Politkovskaya's passionate commitment to truth, justice and human dignity is to launch a common effort to make real her dream of a democratic Russia where citizens will not need to pay with their lives for telling the truth."
"(DE) Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there is no doubt about it: where our relations with Russia are concerned, we are in a very tricky position."
"The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya may be the most recent, but it is not the only one, for such things are not a particularly rare occurrence."
"That is something that embarrasses us, but it should embarrass Russia even more - much more, in fact."
"I would like to say something about three problem areas in which our relations with Russia are beset with difficulties."
"Firstly, as already mentioned, there is human rights and freedom of opinion."
"What we find particularly regrettable is that Russia does not realise that it is itself harmed by the abuse of freedom of opinion and of human rights that goes on within it."
"These things may perhaps harm us as well by interfering with our relations with Russia, but it is Russia itself that is most harmed, in that it is hindered from developing in a positive and democratic way."
"Secondly, there is the neighbourhood policy, and, while we are not, today, discussing South Ossetia and Transnistria, it is nonetheless also the case that we in the European Union find Russia's policy in respect of its neighbours unacceptable."
"It is not acceptable that it should be Russia that decides what is to become of the peoples of South Ossetia or of Transnistria."
"That is for the people who live there to decide for themselves, and they must decide that freely rather than under duress or in response to military pressure - perhaps even exerted by Russia, and so we will have to speak in quite frank terms to Russia about this."
"Lastly, there is the energy issue, and, while I agree with all those who have spoken out in favour of a common energy policy - as, indeed, the President of the Commission did quite plainly and unmistakeably - I wonder how many of those who applaud today would have applauded if we had said, a year ago, that we needed a common energy policy."
"And will they all applaud when they are told that they, too, need to rearrange their own preferences in line with one?"
"The fact is that, while we are demanding a common energy policy, nothing has yet been said about what it should be like, and, when we start doing something about improving energy efficiency, developing alternative forms of energy and taking the appropriate action in transport and housing, there will be many who will get up and say, 'no, that was not what we meant'."
"Back to Russia, though."
"Our problem today is that relations between the EU and Russia where energy policy is concerned are unbalanced, that Russia - under Putin - is, unfortunately making energy policy more and more into a political power issue rather than doing as we do and treating it as an economic factor, and if we want to do business with Russia, it really does have to be only on condition that we and it negotiate together as equal partners."
"One thing that Russia must bear in mind is that the energy reserves - the gas reserves in particular - are running out; they will not be exhausted today, but they will be in eight or ten years' time, perhaps lasting as long as twelve, and the question arises of what Russia will do then."
"It is also in Russia's own interests that it should be aware of the fact that it needs our technology, our know-how and our money, and that it should therefore work at building up a relationship of equality where energy policy is concerned."
"If we, on energy issues, deal with one another as equals, we will also arrive at the right solutions."
"If we do not, then it is not just the European Union that will suffer the consequences, but Russia as well."
"It follows that Russia should recognise where its real, long-term interests lie."
"It has much to learn from dialogue with us, with the European Union."
"(FR) Madam President, Anna Politkovskaya knows why she is dead."
"The postscript to her last book is entitled: 'Am I scared?'"
"Why did she write?"
"She wrote because she believed that words can save lives."
"She knew that she was in danger; she had been kept locked up; she had been the victim of a poison attempt; and she regularly received death threats."
"She was executed simply because she was telling the truth."
"In her book, 'Chechnya: Russia's disgrace', she writes: 'Putin and his people have given their blessing to something that no country can accept, namely a form of corruption based on the bloodletting of thousands of victims, an army ravaged by military anarchy, a chauvinistic attitude within the government apparatus that is passed off as patriotism, wild rhetoric about a strong State, and official, popular racism against the Chechens, the fall-out of which extends to other Russian peoples."
"Putin's Russia now produces new pogrom enthusiasts on a daily basis, and attacks against the Caucasians have become routine.'"
"Do you know when she wrote that text?"
"She wrote it in 2003, and what do we see happening today?"
"We see raids, arbitrary arrests and persecutions of the Georgians and of the human rights NGOs, which, I might add, have just lodged a complaint."
"How does Mr Putin respond?"
"Mr Putin declares that the measures taken against the Georgians are appropriate and that the State agents are acting in accordance with Russian law."
"Mrs Politkovskaya never stopped denouncing human rights violations."
"I hope that the 25 will have the courage to say to Mr Putin what that woman alone had the courage to say and that they will not merely utter a few fine words about the investigation ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, the Finnish Presidency has declared the implementation of an energy partnership between the European Union and Russia."
"I would like to ask how it intends to achieve this."
"So far it has been less a question of partnership than of the 'Finlandisation' of EU-Russia relations."
"The EU's policy towards Russia is mainly one of concessions, and it is also ambiguous in its positions."
"This is often at the cost of the new Baltic Member States, as well as Poland."
"A textbook example of this is the German-Russian agreement to build a north European gas pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"Russia is skilfully using its position as a monopolist on the European energy market."
"Operating the principle of 'divide and rule', Russia is making agreements with stronger states over the heads of weaker ones, and the EU meekly accepts this."
"So far we have not even managed to get Russia to ratify the European Energy Charter, a fundamental EU document relating to the energy market."
"The informal summit between the Heads of State or Government in Lahti in which the Russian president is to participate should bring about a change to this state of affairs."
"In this matter more than any other, the EU must speak up with a single voice and from a decisive negotiating standpoint."
"(FI) Madam President, my city of birth, Lahti, may be the stage for an important event when it hosts the EU summit."
"The subject-matter is most apt for Lahti, an area which for a long time has had a high profile as a centre of excellence in environmental technology - because there is no point talking about energy without energy efficiency."
"The most effective way of quickly increasing self-sufficiency in energy is to improve energy efficiency and conservation."
"When we hold the energy dialogue with Russia, we also need to say that it is not politically wise to increase our dependence on Russia for energy any further."
"In the light of the climate challenge, we need all the resources we can muster."
"All low-emission energy must be given the credit it is due."
"It is high time we did away with the idea that renewable energy and emission-free nuclear power are somehow opposed to each other."
"This is an illusion: it is something that is more in the mind than what is actually the case when it comes to practical attitudes to energy."
"I have asked the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry to include the re-examination of Bulgaria's accession conditions on the Lahti agenda."
"I am alluding to the unfair and unnecessary decision to close four of the six nuclear reactors at Kozloduy."
"When we look at the criteria behind the decision today, we can see that the condition imposed on Bulgaria in Helsinki seven years ago is now obsolete."
"It is also unreasonable in view of European energy policy objectives."
"Improvements have been made, and the Council's working group has itself stated that the power plants meet safety conditions."
"Even so, they have to be closed by the end of the year."
"If Finland does not address the problem now, there will be a shortage of energy not only in Bulgaria but also in its neighbouring countries, whose electricity needs Bulgaria has met these last five years."
"The Commission's claim that these reactors could be improved in economic terms has proven wrong."
"Kozloduy produces electricity at less than two cents per kilowatt-hour."
"Closing them can be partially compensated for, and that will be through the use of power plants burning lignite, the dirtiest of all energy sources."
"Consequently, EU cash is being used to switch from a cleaner technology to a dirtier one."
"That is madness."
"In asking for the case to be re-examined, I am not saying that we should renege on the agreement, but rather that we should examine it in the light of current information, so that there could be flexibility on the closure date."
"Why should Bulgaria increase its greenhouse gas emissions when it has an alternative which has been found to be safe?"
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, he who speaks here of Finlandisation may be thinking of himself."
"It may be a long journey for him to get to Finland's level in terms of democracy and its economy, because we are at the forefront of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"This has come about through hard work."
"Come, follow us!"
"The themes at Lahti are investment and innovation."
"They are Finland's priorities too."
"The Union's level of investment in research and development is totally inadequate."
"The Barcelona objectives have been achieved by just two countries: one of them is Finland, the other Sweden."
"I am ashamed of the short-sightedness of Europe's leaders."
"Europe is in a constitutional crisis and spiritually powerless at the same time."
"We are just not coping in many areas because our investment in research lags behind that of our competitors, and soon the East will catch us up."
"Out of this fragmented scientific arena we urgently need to build an efficient, straightforward and high-level European area of research."
"Through cooperation and collaboration we will succeed."
"We will be an area where the sun is setting unless we put innovation quickly into practice."
"As far as the founding of a European Institute of Technology is concerned, the project lacks money and direction."
"As rapporteur, my own opinion is: let there be innovation and the transfer of innovation into practical realisation; then our standard of living will improve."
"We regard Russia as a strategic partner, and we will renew the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement."
"The shocking murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaja does not sit well with the Russia which we are hoping will become a better partner for the European Union."
"She fought against corruption and violence; even the country's government says she did."
"Why was Politkovskaja not given protection?"
"Everyone knew about the death threats."
"This serious matter needs to be raised at Lahti."
"Europe is becoming more and more dependent on imports of energy."
"Dependence is growing at a phenomenal rate."
"As our problem is security of supply, and Russia has a problem with good customers - that is, a problem securing long-term agreements which can help the country invest in the energy infrastructure - I propose a solution where we strike a major deal and address both these issues at the same time."
"That way, the markets will open up both in Russia and the European Union under the same rules; that is, an energy agreement will be ratified in the same package."
"This way, we will create energy security for both parties and, obviously, especially for ourselves."
"(FI) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia's energy resources and our desire to secure deliveries of oil and gas must not be allowed to blur our vision when it comes to the worsening state of democracy and civil rights in Russia."
"Civil society is in dire circumstances there."
"Following the murder of Anna Politkovskaja, this should at last be obvious to everyone."
"Human rights violations, assaults and even murder do not just target political opposition but also minority nationalities, dozens of which exist in Russia."
"The Mari Nation is one, and the European Parliament has also turned its attention to the outrages it has experienced."
"The conflicts relating to nationality are also connected with Anna Politkovskaja's murder."
"She was murdered because she told the truth about what is happening in Chechnya."
"On the very next day after the murder, thousands of Finns gathered in front of the Russian embassy for a candlelit demonstration, the like of which had never been seen before."
"I hope that the Finnish Government, as the country to hold the Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers, will express to Russia just as clearly its shock and the concern that we feel."
"Human rights must be at the core of Russian relations."
"in writing. - (SV) Madam President, next week's Lahti Summit will deal with the issue of a common energy policy."
"This is another example of the fixity of purpose with which the political establishment, for purposes concerned purely with political power, exploits a variety of social problems in order to promote the EU's positions."
"In reality, there is very little reason to conduct energy policy at EU level."
"We are at a stage in history when it is beginning to appear quite certain that the emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from human combustion of carbon and hydrocarbons are causing climate change."
"We need to find ways of resolving this situation."
"Yet no one in a position of power in the EU is able to decide which types of energy we should choose in order to secure a sustainable energy supply for the future."
"What is more, the requirements of the different countries vary widely."
"Certain countries have the greatest possible interest in finding methods of separating and storing carbon dioxide from the combustion of coal and oil."
"Some countries are prepared to allow themselves to become dependent on natural gas from Russia, while others would rather pin their hopes on nuclear power, water power, wind and wave power, biomass or geothermal energy."
"There are various ways by which all of them can reduce their energy consumption."
"In so doing, countries must be free to experiment and try out a variety of routes."
"It is through such institutional competition between countries that progress occurs."
"The idea of the EU prescribing how much of each type of energy is to be used is an absurd notion that is dangerous for the future of Europe."
"Madam President, I am very happy that the President-in-Office has confirmed that discussions at Lahti will centre on the whole question of energy."
"Like the last speaker, Mr Lundgren, I hope that climate change will also be a core part of these discussions."
"The protection of the citizen and his or her environment needs to be put at the centre of energy policy."
"Climate change and its possible repercussions, air pollution in cities, the deterioration of the urban environment and all the other pollution nuisances of which we are aware have a strong impact on our citizens in their everyday lives in economic, social and health terms."
"We know that the planet is now 0.6oC warmer today than it was a hundred years ago."
"We know that by 2020 our environment will have warmed up by another 0.8oC."
"That global warming will lead to extraordinary weather conditions such as storms, extra rain and floods."
"We hear from the experts that water levels could rise by up to a metre."
"If that happens, countries like Bangladesh and - nearer to home - the Netherlands will face catastrophe."
"This is how important it is."
"Last winter we witnessed a crisis in Ukraine - who will witness another crisis this evening when they play Scotland at football! - and we saw the first interruption in our gas supplies for 40 years."
"We get 22% of our gas from Russia, and this is a dangerous position for the EU to be in because, following that crisis last year, we discovered that some of the newer Member States only had 24 hours of reserve supplies."
"As Mr Barroso said on the subject of immigration, in terms of energy we cannot go on with 25 - soon to be 27 - disparate and completely separate energy policies."
"We have to centralise and have a coherent energy policy run from the centre."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the most recent summits in Tampere and Luxembourg again showed the limits of European immigration policy and the limits of solidarity amongst European governments."
"We therefore hope that you will be able, in Lahti, to at last tackle the underlying causes of immigration."
"If we want to have fewer people arriving on our southern borders, the answer is not, and never will be, to increase patrols and speed up return flights."
"I have met these immigration applicants: all the hope of their family and of their village rests on them and some of them would prefer death to failure."
"Combating illegal immigration, therefore, does not mean condemning these victims by sending them back to a destiny from which they were trying to escape; it means targeting the people who organise the trafficking, who deceive people by holding out the prospect of a better future in Europe, and targeting those who exploit them in Europe."
"Should we not also make European policy on visas more flexible?"
"That is the way to fight against clandestine activity."
"If it is true that we need workers, we need people with rights, not slaves."
"We have to accept that regularisations may be necessary in order to fight against the exploiters."
"Trafficking in human beings can only be combated effectively if we take action against undeclared employment and the exploitation of migrants in our own countries."
"We also have to admit that we have been paying for Africa for a long time, we have to admit that our codevelopment policies have not been fair, and we have to allow for massive development of poor countries."
"Until now Europe has been happy just to make declarations of good intentions."
"We have to invest massively in these countries and also help to create public services that are accessible to everyone and to set up businesses that will pay their employees fairly, which, it has to be said, is not always the case at present."
"Workers are often exploited by European businesses in their own country and that, I repeat, is something that we must not be afraid to say."
"Finally, our Member States have to realise that we must work together and that we will not be able to really do anything by each keeping ourselves to ourselves."
"Let us go beyond our national selfishness which is leading straight into disaster."
"Madam President, well, here we go again: another Heads of State Summit, another discussion about our competitiveness - or, should I say, lack of competitiveness - and another complete waste of time!"
"We have been here before haven't we?"
"Do you remember, in March 2000, the Lisbon Agenda?"
"I sat here and I heard this wonderful pronouncement that the EU was going to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"It is not going very well, is it, Mr Barroso?"
"I do not think you are going to meet those targets in the course of the next three and a half years!"
"And then we heard it last summer, when Mr Blair came here."
"He stood up and told us that we had to face the challenge of globalisation, and we could only do that if Europe became competitive, if we started to invest more money in research and development."
"And, of course, nothing has happened again."
"If you really want to improve competitiveness, then what you will do this weekend is look at the 91 000 pages of close-type legislation that make up the acquis communautaire and decide to get rid of a substantial chunk of it."
"If you were serious about making Europe competitive, if you were serious about moving into the modern world, that is what you would do."
"I am amused that Denmark is to be the economic study for the weekend."
"Well, I understand that, because they have got the highest rate of employment in the European Union."
"I wonder whether that is because they have got their own currency - they are able to manage their own fiscal and monetary policy."
"In fact, unemployment figures outside the eurozone are half those inside the eurozone."
"So the real conclusion this weekend is that we should be doing far less at European level, because everything the EU touches turns to disaster."
"(PL) Madam President, the meeting between our leaders and President Putin will be an opportunity to raise the issue of secure energy supplies, and to express our extreme - and I repeat our extreme - concern at the state of Russian democracy and respect for human rights."
"Too many times our politicians have buried their heads in the sand, and too many times they have accepted meaningless explanations from the Russian side, until finally the conscience of Russian journalism, Anna Politkovskaya, was brutally murdered by shots to the head, like Galina Starovoytova before her."
"These two victims mark the beginning and the end of the process of the retreat from democracy in Russia."
"Mrs Starovoytova's death in 1998 marked the beginning of the retreat from democratic standards in that country, because she was a symbolic figurehead, the leader of the St Petersburg democrats."
"The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya is a blow to what remains of the free press in Russia."
"Whoever ordered the killing knew that the victim was a person of unyielding character, a symbol of truth and independent journalism."
"I did not know Anna Politkovskaya personally, although I did have the pleasure of working with Galina Starovoytova, and always admired her courage."
"For this reason, in view of their sacrifice, and before we feel the effects of Russia's retreat from democracy on our own heads, I appeal for respect for human rights and civil freedoms in Russia to be made a condition of further political dialogue with that country."
"(PT) Madam President, there are some very important issues on the Lahti agenda such as energy policy, illegal immigration, competitiveness and innovation."
"It is inevitable, however, that the issue of freedom of the press should also be addressed."
"Democracy, freedom and human rights are essential issues at a summit of this importance, due to be attended by President Putin at a time when the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya is uppermost in our minds."
"The European Council must call on President Putin to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice."
"At a time when Europe is facing the effects of climate change and rising oil prices, energy efficiency must, as a matter of urgency, be stepped up. Furthermore, dependence on fossil fuels must be reduced to help the economy, the environment and the quality of life of Europe's citizens."
"The EU must diversify the sources and suppliers of its energy and must prioritise renewable energy so as to honour its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol."
"The idea of linking innovation to competitiveness makes perfect sense for the Finnish Presidency and for my country, Portugal."
"Harnessing innovation to boost competitiveness is one of the approaches of the Lisbon Strategy put forward by the Portuguese Presidency in 2000."
"Eight examples of best practice, selected by the European authorities, were presented a few days ago at the first meeting of the national coordinators of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Portugal deserves praise for the Company in One Hour project."
"Mr President, the murder of Anna Politkovskaya is a threefold tragedy."
"It is personal - a tragedy for her family - but it is also a tragedy for Russian society, because it is a sign of an emerging development in that large country, and it is a tragedy for democracy, because it was a murder of an important democratic element in Russia."
"It was a step down the ladder which is weakening democracy in that country."
"It was said earlier here today that we should be realistic about democracy in Russia."
"I do not know what the speaker really meant, but let us indeed be realistic about democracy in Russia: if we do not stand up for democracy in Russia, we will leave people like Anna Politkovskaya and thousands of others on their own."
"If we do not stand up for democracy and the rule of law in Russia, we will not strengthen the forces in Russia that can make Russia a better country and a better partner."
"Not standing up for democracy will not make Russia a better partner in energy policy or in any other area."
"(Applause)"
"Not calling for democracy and the rule of law does not make Russia a better society."
"Russia will be a credible energy partner only when democracy is stronger and when the rule of law is stabilised."
"That is what it means to be realistic about democracy in Russia, and let that be stated here today."
"Mr Barroso, some of the competences we have in the European Union - the internal market for energy policy, the trans-European networks, competition rules and trade policy - are the instruments that we must use with relation not only to Russia but also to other parts of the world."
"They are the best basis for the future energy policy of the European Union."
"Let us use them and let us go forward step by step."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union must face up to the political, economic and cultural challenges of recent times."
"Firstly, the time has come to form a common European energy policy consisting of measures on the scale of the European policy on heavy industry after World War II."
"Secondly, the European Union must give a unified response to the problems of mass illegal immigration of people from all over the world, which is having a considerable impact on some countries."
"Finally, we have to achieve a real breakthrough in developing scientific research, new technologies, competitiveness and economic innovation within the Member States."
"In Europe we are currently in need of courage, vision and a forward-looking strategy."
"We need to deepen integration and achieve a truly common and unified policy in these three areas."
"I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that President Putin was invited to the summit in Lahti, and at the efforts to forge a strategic partnership with Russia."
"At the same time, however, our agreement with Russia should not be pursued at the cost of tolerating violations of human rights and media freedom."
"Russia is a land of immeasurable mineral wealth, but above all it is a land of people such as the murdered journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist whose courage and honesty is a symbol of civic Russia, and whose activities should become a symbol and an inspiration for the whole of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find today's debate on the one hand a sobering experience, but am also, on the other, refreshed and reinvigorated by it."
"Many of those who have spoken in it have put forward factual analyses, have set the right goals and have told hard-hitting truths, but what comes next?"
"What action shall we now take?"
"Confidence is built not by analysis on its own, but only by action."
"There are three messages I want to give the President of the Council to take with him to the Summit."
"The first is that, if he has listened to us, he will have heard us telling him not to treat his talks with Vladimir Putin as just 'business as usual', not to reduce the summit to a meeting about energy policy, but instead, also to talk about all the things that have been mentioned today."
"Secondly, we urge him to put before us a timetable detailing when we can expect to have the EU internal market in energy of which President Barroso spoke, and thirdly, we want him to give us a timetable for when the European Union will become a research area."
"Turning to energy policy, the partnership with Russia is only a part of the energy policy that Europe needs."
"Our priority is greater independence where energy is concerned."
"We favour above all the prioritisation of research on the reduction of energy consumption and the creation of sources of renewable energy, and that is our great contribution to more innovation. We urge you to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in innovation and enable their representatives to take part in the tripartite dialogue."
"Do not forgot how this year started with the reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine, nor that the most recent major event in Russia was the murder of a critical journalist, which attracted far more public attention than the many similar murders that preceded it."
"I want to focus my remarks on one of the key topics for the summit: innovation."
"I notice that not many speakers have talked about it today."
"I just want to encourage both the President-in-Office and President Barroso to make sure that this remains at the heart of the discussions."
"As you pointed out, President Barroso, there could not be a better place than Finland to have that discussion."
"I was pleased that in both your speeches you talked about the main competition coming from China, India and the other Asian economies."
"We have to start looking outside and to start building on the real strengths of our technology."
"One of the things I particularly want to appeal to you to promote in your summit - something with which to engage Europe's leaders - is to energise and use the power of public authorities."
"They are spending billions of euros of public money on developing new services, but I do not think that many of them are thinking about how they use that money to generate innovation and to push forward the new products and services that European industry and companies are willing to provide."
"Let us take Nokia as a good example, because you will be in Finland, the home of Nokia, for your summit."
"Wireless networks, wireless innovation, wireless services: these are the sort of things that we should be developing for health, for education, for raising the quality of public services, for transforming the quality of experience the citizens have in interacting with us."
"That is something that I would like you to put firmly on your agenda with the European leaders, because if we can achieve that we will make some serious moves forward."
"We know that other countries are doing that, particularly the United States."
"In conclusion, I notice, President Barroso, that we see your European institute of technology on the agenda."
"I hope you will convince us that it is a worthwhile investment."
"I am not yet convinced, because I think many universities are already doing what you want to do - it is a lot of money."
"Let us put innovation at the heart of what we do at the summit, and I hope that you will give it the importance that it deserves."
"(PL) Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the statements of my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the situation of democracy in Russia, and I do not wish to repeat their arguments, to which I give my full support."
"I would like to raise two other questions, and to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for preparing two items for the informal summit in Lahti, namely energy and innovation."
"In energy we need a common policy, both within the European Union, to establish a common energy market, and outside it, for example joint European negotiations with the partners who supply our oil and gas."
"This is extremely important."
"We need to ensure that there is no repetition of the situation where one Member State's negotiations, for example, concerning supplies of oil or gas from Russia, place other Member States in an extremely unfavourable position."
"It is extremely important that we approach our common energy policy in this way: this will be a major step towards creating a common foreign policy."
"There is, however, another aspect to our external policy regarding energy: Ukraine's pipelines are currently in a bad state of repair, and they are the last route for energy supplies from the east which is independent of Gazprom."
"It is important that we invest in these pipelines, and that we make every effort to secure the funds necessary for such an investment."
"On the issue of innovation, I would like to raise just three points."
"In the first place, we need a responsible economic policy whereby innovation is adopted by industry, which we do not have on our continent. And that means an economic strategy."
"The second point is the issue of a European patent: we need to have our own European patent."
"Thirdly I believe there is a need for a European Institute of Technology which will serve innovation."
"I personally support Mr Barroso's idea and believe that we now have the opportunity to finally sort things out."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mrs Lehtomäki, I very much welcome the communication on innovation that the Commission will be publishing next week."
"It represents one of the first serious attempts at drawing up an EU strategy for the positioning of Europe in the context of globalisation, and so I believe that it will be the most important item on the agenda at the informal meeting in Lahti."
"Innovation is, in particular, characteristic of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the communication takes that fact into account."
"As the Minister has said, innovation calls for European standards, and there are many fields in which much remains to be done on that front."
"For that to happen, we need - as you yourself said, Mr President of the Commission - to spend more on research and investment."
"Much as I rejoice in Finland's good example, I also have to point out that my own region, Baden-Württemberg, spends 3.6% of its gross domestic product per annum on research and development, which is a good deal more than either the USA or Japan do."
"We also need more confidence in our own abilities, and that is at the heart of this communication."
"We have to say more about what we in Europe will, together, be able to achieve once our structures have been revised, even in a globalised world."
"We have an outstanding internal market, which - while we do have to further extend it - does nonetheless offer us protection."
"We do need more self-confidence in our dealings with Russia and China, but we also need to know where, within the European Union, we need to undertake reforms in order to remain competitive, and the innovation strategy offers an excellent basis for that."
"It has also been said that a more innovative approach to the award of public contracts is needed, and examples of what is meant by this have been given."
"These things are already being done in my region."
"I believe that there are some splendid possibilities for putting Europe in a better position to cope with globalisation, and I also believe that this informal summit in Lahti should help to develop - perhaps in the coming year - a globalisation strategy for the European Union that will enable us to convince the public that this Europe of ours has a chance in a globalised world."
"(LT) Mr President, we must have clarity, here in Brussels, when speaking about Lahti."
"The beginning of today's session revealed how disunited, polarised and easily manipulated we are."
"The European Parliament appeared to be unable to react immediately, with a joint document, to a terrible crime in Moscow, so as not to disturb the Russian president touring Europe."
"This is just one more indication that the European Union does not have its own European policy in respect of Russia, and that we, in Europe, implement only a pro-Russian policy in this respect."
"The cajoling of leaders does a disservice to Russia if anybody is still to believe that Russia could become a European country rather than Europe becoming a political annex to undemocratic Russia."
"We are only talking about Europe's united Energy Strategy, but we are closing our eyes to the fact that Russia will never allow this to happen as it already has its Trojan horse in the middle of Europe."
"The supporters of Mr Schroeder and others suffering from political blindness will continue to destroy a united Europe."
"Unfortunately, here in Parliament we have only one option - to talk openly about the deliberate moral surrender of influential Europeans."
"The Russian president is the one who is absolutely open when he says that European values are unsuitable for his Russia and his regime."
"According to Russian politicians, Europe can simply throw out its Energy Charter together with the Human Rights Charter, since Europe will sign anything dictated by Russia anyway."
"This was voiced in Sochi and on various other occasions."
"Such is the real partnership and the common space."
"This is the common space where journalists are murdered and we do not dare to question if this common space is for us."
"We nevertheless get irritated about North Korea and Iraq, instead of simply recognising that both buttons, the one in Teheran and the other in Pyongyang, are pressed by the same player somewhere in between."
"We should at least try to understand that Anna Politkovskaya, the last brave journalist, was murdered not only by Putin's Russia, but by conformist Europe as well."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, it is appalling that the road to civil freedom and respect for fundamental human rights needs to be paved with the killing of innocent people."
"Today we are discussing the murder of Mrs Politkovskaya, the woman who unflinchingly exposed the crimes committed against the Chechen people by the Russians."
"But let us remember that, before her, others lost their lives in the struggle against dictators, for example the Ukrainian journalist Mr Gongadze or the Lebanese journalist Mr Kassir."
"In these cases, did the state do everything to protect those who exposed the connection between public structures and criminals?"
"Or did hatred for their uncompromising behaviour and their writing lead to a closing of eyes, to a washing of Pilate's hands, to the indifference of the state to their fate and the threat of death that hung over their heads?"
"Russia has always produced great figures who have swum against the tide of dictatorship and risked their lives to expose the crimes and iniquities of their governments."
"We only need to think of such names as Kravchenko, Bukovsky, Sakharov or Solzhenitsyn."
"Should we as citizens of the free world always abandon these people to their fate?"
"No, we did not support Mrs Politkovskaya enough during her lifetime."
"Let us support her after her death."
"I believe that the investigation into this crime should be conducted under international supervision, as happened in the case of the murder of Lebanon's prime minister Rafik Hariri."
"I cannot imagine the European Union signing a cooperation agreement with Moscow without this crime being investigated, and without those who ordered it and who carried it out being put on trial."
"The European Union should either give priority to commitments to freedom and civil and human rights, or to economic and energy interests."
"Mr President, the hour of truth has come."
"We must be uncompromising."
"We owe it to the murdered journalist."
"(MT) Mr President, I hope that next week's summit will discuss the letter sent to the Finnish Presidency by no less than eight Heads of Government, who wrote to you about illegal immigration."
"Although summer is over, and one now expects the flow to abate, it is common knowledge that we had a crisis, and that it is still there."
"If we remain passive, we will be facing even greater problems next year."
"I must say that during the last few days we witnessed the first concrete steps in our bid to convince European countries to tackle the problem of illegal immigration in unison."
"Firstly, last week saw the start of patrols in the Mediterranean."
"I can see Mr Frattini here, whose role I wish to acknowledge."
"I hope that these Mediterranean patrols send out a clear message that the Mediterranean is not an open sea, free for all, where organised crime ferries immigrants to Europe unimpeded."
"Secondly, we took a vote in the Committee on Budgets whereby we increased substantially the budget for the Frontex Agency to almost EUR 35 million, so that it can strengthen its operations at our external borders."
"I hope the Council is willing to support us, rather than reducing the budget for Frontex as it has already tried to do."
"How can the Council say it is conducting the struggle against illegal immigration in a serious manner, if, at the same time, it allows European governments to act in a niggardly manner and try to reduce the budget in this area rather than increase it?"
"Thirdly, it appears that agreement will be reached this week about the four European immigration-related funds, which will operate as from next January."
"I am satisfied with the adoption of measures such as the emergency clause, which enables the European Union to extend immediate financial help in emergency situations."
"Much remains to be done, if we want people to feel that Europe is indeed taking into consideration their feelings about illegal immigration."
"Parliament has spoken and so has the Commission."
"The Council is now expected to do its part."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, listening to Mr Landsbergis's football fan club giving him applause, I hope the fan club of the Finnish national team in a European state called Kazakhstan is as strong as his, because we are 25 minutes into the match and it is still 0-0, so we need a little bit of help!"
"First of all I support the Finnish Presidency and its agenda for Lahti."
"With regard to external energy, you know what you need to do: you need to thank Mr Putin for the fact that it is actually on the agenda, because at about this time last year he was squeezing the Ukrainian pipelines a little bit and that is the reason we are actually talking about it in Lahti."
"So give him a big thank-you when he gets there."
"Second, with regard to innovation, this is not product placement but the truth is that we spend about EUR 4 billion a year on innovation and research and development."
"That is less than Nokia spends on research and development per year."
"I hope that makes the leaders of the European Council think."
"My third point relates to EU-Russia relations."
"It is funny to listen to the debate here, apart from the murder case, of course."
"Sometimes it seems to me that we are much quicker to criticise the United States than we are Russia, and perhaps in the latest case we should deal with Russia as a superpower much like the United States."
"I want to support the President of the Commission very strongly on EIT."
"I think there are a lot of misunderstandings around the concept."
"It is a network which I think would work quite well."
"Everyone agrees on the problem, now it is a question of how we are going to find a solution."
"I think we need public and private partnerships, much like the MIT in the United States."
"In that sense I hope that this initiative of yours will go through."
"Finally, the problem with informal European Councils is that you usually get very few practical things out of them."
"President-in-Office, if you come out of that meeting with three things, I think it will have been a success."
"One: a green light for the EIT; two: some patent legislation, or at least a promise to have it; and three: a common energy policy."
"If you do not get these results I think future informal European Councils will be as empty as this Chamber is today."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its valuable contribution during this discussion today."
"I can assure you that I will convey the message to the Prime Minister for him to look at during the preparations for the Lahti Summit."
"It is of course true that innovation and competitiveness have been on the European agenda for some time, but it is now our aim to turn this discussion into action, at least to open the door to the way forward."
"Action is what is really needed at the moment."
"In the framework of the strategic partnership that we have with Russia, all the issues can and will be discussed."
"I am sure that the very important points you have raised during this discussion will also be discussed during the meetings."
"I am very happy that you will have an opportunity to continue the discussion on the results of the Lahti Summit with the Prime Minister of Finland later this month, on 25 October in Strasbourg."
"I thank you very much and look forward to having some 'deliverables' from the Lahti Summit."
"Mr President, first of all let me welcome the broad support that was given for the agenda for innovation, for a European institute of technology, for a common energy policy and for a European immigration policy."
"But let me tell you that we need to deliver that message outside this room, because, as some of you said, there are still some misunderstandings."
"Let me just mention the EIT."
"It is interesting that everybody agrees that in Europe we are not doing enough in terms of innovation; there are not enough links between the universities and the research centres and the world of the economy, business and practical projects."
"But when an idea comes to change that situation, immediately there is resistance."
"It is amazing!"
"Everybody then says, 'but we have excellent universities!' - of course we have excellent universities!"
"But if we have excellent universities, why are we falling behind the Americans and others?"
"Something is wrong."
"The status quo is not an option."
"We cannot go on with business as usual."
"I know we have excellent universities."
"Universities were created in Europe."
"They are a European creation, but we are not taking advantage of the full benefits or the full potential of our European dimension."
"Let us be frank: some of our universities are still very corporatist, very closed."
"We need a European dimension."
"Even the biggest Member States lack the dimension to promote the global culture we need now to face the challenges of this 21st century."
"Therefore, the idea is network-based."
"It is not a huge bureaucratic institution; it is network-based, building on the principles of excellence, on what all excellent universities and excellent research centres are doing, but with a view to connecting businesses with research so that we can promote innovation."
"At the Commission I met with the leaders of the most important European companies that are driving research in the world."
"I got great support for the idea and I could name some of the companies."
"Two of those leaders in European business came from the United States, and they told me at the meeting that their biggest shock when they came to Europe was to discover that, unlike in the United States where they have American institutions for the whole of America, in Europe we do not have that."
"Only now are we starting with the European Research Council."
"So we have great institutions to promote research in Germany, Britain, France and Sweden."
"We have great things, but we are missing a European dimension."
"We are missing a European mission to give them the real tools they need to compete with the best."
"That is why I believe this is a great idea."
"I hope that, not only will it be supported in general, but that it will be supported when we come forward with practical proposals."
"That is why I hope to have your support when we come forward next week with a practical proposal on the EIT, and I hope for your support when in January we come forward with a really ambitious energy package."
"My final point concerns coherence."
"The best way to negotiate with Russia is from a coherent and unified position."
"If we want to be credible when we discuss matters with Russia or other partners, we have to show them that we are able to have a coherent policy ourselves."
"We cannot discuss energy with them in a serious manner if we have 25 different energy policies."
"It would not be credible, let's face it."
"The first thing to do if we want to be seen from outside as credible, is to put our own house in order and to have a real joint approach to energy."
"The same, of course, applies to other issues."
"But I strongly agree that the fight against climate change is a crucial element in our energy policy and we should recall that the European Union is a key player in that field."
"We are, in fact, leading in the world."
"I can tell you that when we discuss this matter with our American friends, with our Russian partners, or with the Chinese or Indians, we always put this question at the forefront of our negotiations."
"It is important to do what we can, but also to involve others in those efforts."
"But what all these issues show - from innovation to immigration, to energy, to the fight against climate change - is a strong argument for Europe."
"In the age of globalisation, even the biggest Member States do not have the means to tackle those challenges."
"So if you want a strong Europe, we are going in the right direction."
"A strong Europe is not bureaucratic, but has a common approach to those issues."
"We should also speak with one voice on human rights, and I hope that this is the message which comes out from Lahti: the European leaders may come from different political and ideological backgrounds, from different national situations, but they are ready to build a strong Europe together and they are ready to speak with one voice to the outside world."
"That is what I am hoping for from Lahti."
"That concludes the debate."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(PT) Quite apart from important international issues, the next European Council is set to include the so-called 'innovation policy', the proposed 'common energy policy', and 'illegal immigration', issues for which working documents have yet to be tabled."
"We shall return to these issues in due course."
"Apparently, two debates have been left off the agenda: one on our 'functional' or 'assimilation-related' 'absorption capacities', that is to say the enlargement to include Croatia and Turkey, and the other on the so-called institutional reform (the composition of the Commission and Parliament, and the Council's decision-making process)."
"Another debate absent from the agenda concerns the attempts to (re)impose the so-called 'European Constitution', which has already been rejected."
"Hitherto, and despite numerous attempts to do so, there is still disagreement over what can now be done to resurrect the, revamped or otherwise, 'European Constitution'."
"Yet its proponents reflect, prepare the ground and set up think tanks while they wait for the French elections and the German Presidency, with the latter expected to present the (pseudo) 'way forward'."
"The more they dither, the less the workers and the people are aware of the real significance and primary objectives of the EU."
"Use of passenger data (PNR) (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the use of passenger data (PNR)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, talks on releasing passenger data to the United States of America were brought to a conclusion last week."
"The outcome of the talks helped to avoid a state of non-agreement between the EU and the United States, which is very important."
"The Presidency has received a letter dated yesterday from Sophia in 't Veld, the European Parliament's rapporteur for the PNR report, and we shall return to the questions raised in it in more detail in writing as soon as possible."
"In the negotiations, we agreed on a new temporary PNR agreement."
"Its purpose is to replace the earlier agreement made in 2004, which the Court of Justice of the European Communities overturned in its judgment last May."
"The negotiations were tough, as the annulment of the earlier agreement threatened to push the EU and the United States into a state of total non-agreement."
"Despite the difficulties, the negotiations mandate given by the Council in June 2006 was adhered to."
"The new arrangement will guarantee both the level of protection of personal data under the former agreement and the continuation of transatlantic air traffic."
"The arrangement therefore makes it possible for passenger data to be released to the US authorities in the future, at the same time guaranteeing an adequate level of data protection when the information is being processed, in accordance with the commitments given previously by the US Customs and Border Protection."
"The Committee of Permanent Representatives followed the progress of the talks closely and discussed the outcome and its content on 6 October."
"Coreper said that it was in favour of signing the text of the negotiations."
"The outcome of the talks was reported to the Ministers of Justice in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which began immediately after Coreper."
"The temporary agreement which resulted from the negotiations will apply after it has been signed."
"Coreper will sign it for the EU tomorrow, and the intention is that the Council should grant the authority to sign as soon as possible."
"The temporary agreement will remain in force until the end of July 2007."
"During this time, the parties intend to agree on a more permanent arrangement for releasing PNR data."
"The aim is to start these talks as soon as possible."
"It took some hard negotiation to reach agreement."
"The United States wanted to change the previous arrangement so that it would accord better with an altered operational environment."
"The biggest challenge in the negotiations was how to respond to the changes that had occurred since 2004 in US legislation and the organisation of the administration while at the same time maintaining the principles relating to standards of data protection for Europeans."
"In addition to the text of the agreement itself, the talks also covered a letter by US negotiators addressed to the Commission and the Presidency which discusses the interpretation of the commitments made regarding the use of PNR data."
"The EU will take the letter into consideration, but it will not become a part of the agreement."
"The outcome of the talks is a success for many reasons."
"Firstly, the temporary arrangement aims at ensuring the security of air passengers."
"This is vitally important."
"Secondly, I wish to stress that the commitments on the use of PNR data given previously by the US administration will continue to apply."
"The aim is to guarantee the same level of data protection for citizens' PNR data as with the previous system."
"The agreement contains a provision which states that the US Department of Homeland Security should be seen to guarantee adequate protection for PNR data sent from the EU."
"This relies specifically on the notion that the DHS will continue to comply with its commitments made in 2004."
"Owing to the organisational changes in the US administration, under the new agreement the number of authorities with electronic access to PNR is greater than before."
"These authorities have, however, been specified in the agreement."
"Thirdly, I am glad that the release of PNR data under the new agreement is aimed at the same 34 fields of data as in the earlier arrangement."
"Fourthly, the new agreement will guarantee the legal security of the public and that transatlantic flights will continue."
"At the same time it will ensure that airlines are able to operate viably."
"We have other good news for airlines."
"During the negotiations, the United States undertook to test systems where airlines can themselves store PNR data on the databases of the US authorities, starting this year."
"This has always been an important objective for us."
"Talks on a more permanent PNR system to replace this temporary agreement in July 2007 are to commence in the near future."
"We have also agreed that questions relating to the storage and destruction of data should only be resolved during these talks on the PNR system."
"We shall therefore return to this matter very soon."
"Mr President, I regret that I cannot stay here for this debate as I have to leave at 6.20 p.m. as agreed earlier with Parliament, and, unfortunately, my flight will not wait a minute longer."
"Mr President, may I start by expressing my full agreement with the Presidency's positive assessment of the value of this agreement, which has a limited time-span - up to July 2007 - but has the prime advantage of guaranteeing juridical continuity in a very sensitive subject."
"It also allows airlines to ensure fitting treatment of the personal data of EU nationals travelling to the United States without disrupting air traffic to and from that country."
"This agreement forms part of a wider commitment."
"I can of course say that, during the very complex negotiations that have been in progress, both the European institutions - the Presidency and the Commission - and the United States have confirmed their willingness to start straight away on a shared project."
"This would cover a wider field and would thus include the reaffirmation of a common will, that of the EU and the United States, to work towards a definite agreement - the one that will enter into force after August 2007, replacing the present temporary one - and to cover the widest possible field of joint cooperation against terrorism, together with protection of the rights of the individual."
"This is a much wider political perspective."
"As I have emphasised on many other occasions, I consider it politically necessary that Parliament should be involved with it, even though the procedures will necessarily form part of the so-called 'third pillar', following the decision of the European Court of Justice."
"It is clear that the contents of this agreement must be considered in more depth."
"I already know that many honourable Members have studied it attentively."
"I should like to make some brief comments."
"Firstly, this agreement does not permit the exchange of a larger amount of data."
"It permits the transmission of data to other agencies which are concerned with customs and border protection and complies entirely with comparable data protection regulations."
"We are not looking at a change in the agreement because, as you know very well, we have clarified the meaning of the undertakings."
"There was in fact a change after 2004 in the structure of the agencies, brought about by domestic United States legislation."
"Previously, that is to say at the beginning of 2004, there was only the United States Customs and Border Protection."
"Now, however, for example, we have a new interlocutor, namely the Department of Homeland Security, which we must take into account, at any rate in interpreting undertakings."
"The agencies that I mentioned earlier also form part of this process, which is why it is impossible not to refer to them."
"What is the distinguishing feature of this interpretation?"
"On the one hand we have to take note of the existence of various agencies; on the other we have established that United States Customs and Border Protection retains the same function as before, this agency - and only this agency - being the direct recipient of transferred data."
"The other agencies can obtain the data that they require from this first agency on a case-by-case basis."
"Thus this is not a matter of direct access to data on the part of other agencies; it is a transmission to other agencies in response to a request."
"What would be the request that justified such a transmission?"
"As I have already said, the request would be made on a case-by-case basis."
"We have specified that the concept 'case-by-case' means the indication either of a concrete threat or of a specific flight or flight-path for which information has been received that justifies the request for data."
"Such a request for data would be justified solely by reasons relating to anti-terrorism investigation, as has happened previously; in this respect nothing has changed."
"We have therefore specified that American agencies with an investigative remit other than anti-terrorism will not have access, not even on the basis of an indirect request."
"The other element which is important in my opinion is, on the one hand, the impossibility of direct access and, on the other, the change in the modalities of accessing data."
"Many honourable Members have in the past frequently emphasised the malfunctioning or the inadequate guarantees of the so-called 'pull' system: that is to say, the system that permits the user to extract data direct from databases."
"We have in consequence requested that the system should be changed and replaced by a system of the 'push' type, as has been requested on numerous occasions by parliamentary authorities; this has been agreed."
"The 'push' system means, as the work clearly indicates, that the data is not extracted but supplied on request."
"It has been agreed that the new mechanism, as we have written in the covering letter to be sent by the United States, will come into operation no later than December 2006, that is within a month and a half at the latest."
"The mechanism will be tested at the beginning to check its functioning, but in any case it will be operational - I repeat - by the end of this year."
"A specific obligation has also been confirmed, namely - bearing in mind section 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union - to respect the fundamental rights of the individual in the handling of personal data."
"We have inserted a reference to that same Article 6, replacing the reference to a directive on data protection, because the European Court of Justice has established that that directive is not directly applicable in security matters."
"An important reference to European legislation would therefore have been missing."
"We have accordingly replaced it with a more general cross-reference - in my view, one that is still more binding - to Article 6 of the EU Treaty, where there is a reference to the fundamental rights of individuals."
"To conclude, the US authorities have a commitment to continue to guarantee, also on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, an acceptable level of protection for the handling of data and therefore, obviously, the possibility of revising the application of this agreement, as has already been laid down in the earlier agreement."
"The final aspect concerns confirmation of the data custody period, a subject that has not been broached."
"It is true that there has been a request to keep data for longer than the period foreseen by the current or previous agreement."
"The request came to nothing, firstly because the agreement will come to an end in July 2007 and, secondly, because we have taken the view that a subject as sensitive as the period of data retention could if necessary be a topic for later negotiations."
"I can assure you that the Commission intends to set in train such negotiations in January 2007, so that they will be sufficiently far advanced by the end of July 2007 for a definitive agreement to be reached."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, only recently, some elements in this House celebrated the ruling of the European Court of Justice to the effect that the agreement between the EU and the United States on US access to airline passenger data was invalid on formal grounds."
"The interim agreement that has now been concluded leaves the nature and scope of the information largely unchanged, however."
"Admittedly, the United States no longer has automatic access to the data, instead having to request them from the airlines."
"This represents a successful negotiation outcome, one for which I should like to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Frattini."
"Nevertheless, the agreement that the European Court of Justice declared invalid clearly stipulated that the customs and border protection authorities were permitted to pass on these data only in exceptional cases."
"Now, airline passenger data may be passed on, as required, to all the American authorities responsible for combating terrorism."
"Passengers probably do not feel that this compromises their security - the opposite is more likely to be the case - but my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has a strong sense that, by referring the case to the Court of Justice, certain Members of this House have done us all a disservice, for one thing that must be recognised today is that the new agreement affords no greater data protection than the old one."
"For this reason, I would plead that we continue to work to safeguard the high standards of data protection in Europe, including in the case of the transfer of airline passenger data."
"While Parliament and the Commission should exert their influence on future negotiations to this end, we must also recognise that a sovereign state such as the United States will continue to exercise the right to lay down rules on who can enter its territory and on what conditions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I wish to say, on behalf of my group, that we urgently needed to reach a new agreement with the United States."
"It was not, indeed, possible to leave the airlines in the state of legal muddle in which they had been since 30 September and under the threat of severe sanctions if they did not transfer the required data."
"We had to reach an agreement common to all the Member States of the European Union in order to guarantee an equivalent level of protection for each one."
"We are nonetheless concerned about facilitating the transfer of this data."
"The subsequent transfer of data to other agencies responsible for the fight against terrorism poses a problem if we do not also have the appropriate guarantees."
"We are asking for European citizens to have the right to effective recourse to a judge in the event of abuse in the use of this data."
"We expect the American authorities to put in place the guarantees of protection that we are asking for and which are included in the declarations of commitment."
"We believe that it is necessary to involve national parliaments too."
"Article 24 of the Treaty provides that the European Union is the contracting party."
"That does not, however, prevent Member States from using a parliamentary ratification procedure."
"Therefore, at the time of signing these judicial cooperation agreements with the United States, the Member States, with the exception of two of them, made a declaration stating that they would not be bound by these agreements until they had been ratified by their parliaments."
"Can you confirm that the same applies to the agreement concerning the PNR data and, if so, when these ratifications are to be carried out?"
"It is a very precise question to which we would like to have an answer."
"Finally, the negotiations for the new 2007 agreement must focus on defining a binding, global framework which guarantees the protection of security and of the fundamental rights of citizens."
"We must not be shy of repeating that the European Parliament and the national parliaments must be involved."
"It is, moreover, necessary to engage in an overall reflection on the protection of data relating to European citizens within the framework of transatlantic relations."
"Indeed, a recent hearing on the company SWIFT revealed to us the potential conflicts between European law and American law and we must sort out these conflicts: it is our responsibility."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have the feeling that I have ended up in the wrong theatre play and I have the wrong script in front of me."
"The President-in-Office and the Commissioner were talking about the agreement and you completely ignored the side letter from the Department of Homeland Security, which gives an interpretation of the agreement that goes in a completely different direction from what you have just said."
"So I am afraid that I am unable to share the joy just expressed by the Presidency and the Commission."
"I sent a letter - to which the President-in-Office just referred - with a number of questions."
"I would very much like to get an answer to those questions, preferably during this sitting, or otherwise in writing."
"For example, you said that there is no change in the number and the nature of the data and there is no change in the level of protection, but how do you then explain the part in the side letter from the Americans that says that, in addition to the purpose of fighting terrorism and related crimes, we will also collect the data to fight infectious disease and other risks?"
"I call that a considerable widening of the scope."
"The sharing of data has been widened to include agencies which have not all been specified."
"The Americans now say that they may not apply the agreed data-retention periods even to the data collected under the old agreement."
"You said that we have agreed to move to a 'push system': I am sorry, but that is not what I read."
"I read that the Americans will move to the 'push system' as soon as it is technically feasible."
"Well, congratulations!"
"That was also part of the old agreement."
"It has been technically feasible for more than a year and the Americans have simply refused to do it."
"So how can you present it this way in a press conference?"
"I would also like to get an answer on the impact on other categories - the precedent that this agreement sets - for example, the bank account details as in the case of SWIFT, and the telecoms records, to which the Americans also have access."
"Could somebody please reply to that?"
"I think we should look to the future, because unfortunately we need this agreement."
"The only other option would have been no agreement, in which case the Member States would not have stood together in solidarity and would have moved ahead and concluded bilateral agreements with the Americans."
"I think that for the future we need a strong and clear mandate."
"Such a strong mandate requires the approval of the European Parliament for reasons of democratic legitimacy."
"That is the only basis on which a new agreement can be concluded."
"Therefore, I hope that the bridging clause will be adopted as soon as possible."
"I know that you are our ally at least on that one."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs in 't Veld is not in the wrong play; this is about the defence of the rights of our citizens and the role of Parliament."
"It is just that the staging is a little tired and the cast is less than brilliant."
"Until the judgment of the European Court of Justice, what we were dealing with was the transfer of highly personal data on our citizens to a foreign country."
"The judgment has revealed that this transfer of data was illegal - and not just on formal grounds, Mrs Klamt."
"We passed on our citizens' data without any legal basis - or, put another way, illegally."
"We are talking about a serious encroachment on fundamental rights without any legal basis."
"There is nothing formal about that."
"This should really make us think."
"What is it, then, that we are dealing with today?"
"We are dealing with an agreement that represents a juridical continuation of this illegal transfer in the third pillar - that is to say, intergovernmental cooperation without the involvement of Parliament, without a public debate, outside the jurisdiction of the Court; without even the involvement of national parliaments, without ratification."
"When Mrs Klamt says that the USA has the right to determine who it admits into its territory and on what conditions, I would reply that, up to now, we have agreed that considerations of human dignity, international law and human rights impose certain limits on this."
"I really consider it an incredible absurdity when the Commission argues that we are passing on the data, but that the protection of our citizens' fundamental rights will remain, as the USA has promised to guarantee the same level of data protection as we enjoy in Europe."
"Do we, then, together with the Americans, now constitute a single superstate?"
"Do fundamental-rights considerations not forbid us to transfer our citizens' data to foreign countries regardless of the level of data protection in force there?"
"Do fundamental-rights considerations not forbid airlines to transfer data even to our authorities where to do so would infringe these rights?"
"Personally, I have to say that the defence of the fundamental rights of European citizens indeed makes for a good play, but the cast and staging are dreadful."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs in 't Veld is right: the PNR agreement concluded last week is by no means cause for celebration."
"Although the fact that we once more have an agreement, as opposed to no agreement, avoids legal uncertainty, nothing has been achieved, in essence, in terms of content."
"On the contrary, the new agreement even falls short of the previous one."
"This has been yet another instance of the EU kowtowing to Washington."
"How else can one interpret the fact that PNR data are to be transmitted directly to the US Department of Homeland Security?"
"The real scandal is the fact that, in future, this all-powerful US authority will be able to routinely transmit data on European airline passengers to all the US authorities active in the field of combating terrorism - which includes the CIA, and we all know what that is capable of."
"I should just like to remind my fellow Members that this House set up a special committee because the CIA, in the process of 'combating terrorism', was taking it upon itself to kidnap and torture Europeans, among them the German citizen Khaled El Masri."
"In the light of this, are we to believe that this notorious secret service will not do as it pleases with airline passenger data on our citizens?"
"The new agreement, too - despite Parliament's demands to the contrary - fails to afford EU citizens even the same means of legal protection as it does American airline passengers."
"EU citizens will not have equivalent means of legal redress to defend themselves against the processing of incorrect data or against the abuse of their data."
"Why was it not possible to make the regulations that apply to US citizens applicable to EU citizens, too - as is the case, for example, with the agreement between the EC and Canada?"
"The PNR agreement does not afford sufficient protection of EC citizens' right of self-determination over their personal data, and my group considers this unacceptable."
"The only ray of hope may be the envisaged change of system from 'pull' to 'push', but even this is relative, as it is not the intention to introduce this change immediately, despite existing commitments on the part of the USA, but to first have a trial run."
"The push system is used in the case of Canada, however, and is perfectly feasible in technical terms."
"What, then, was stopping the EU from insisting that the USA immediately honour the commitment it made to us a long time ago?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, despite the short time available to me, there are three points that I want to raise."
"First of all, what further guarantees have the American authorities given with regard to how the data will be used?"
"I know we have the 'push system' and the 'pull system' and so on, but what kind of criteria are laid down for the use of the data?"
"Secondly, when we hear about actions on a case-by-case basis determining whether a threat exists or if a particular flight may be under threat, how much time do we have to be able to respond to that request for information, and what difficulty will there be in accessing that data?"
"And I mean that from a European perspective as well as a US perspective."
"Thirdly, and I suppose most importantly, if we find that some data has been misused, what comeback do we have?"
"What mechanism is in place to ensure that an individual or groups of individuals whose data has been misused can get some kind of comeback from the American authorities?"
"These are questions which I think all European citizens want to have answered."
"I agree with the deal, I think it is a good deal in general and better than the previous deal, but there are still requirements for further clarity on it."
"(EL) Mr President, I have listened very carefully to everything said by both the Minister and Commissioner Frattini."
"They have both accepted that the agreement reached has positive elements for Europe."
"My view is that the views which prevailed were the American views."
"I have three specific comments on this interim agreement."
"Firstly, it says in the agreement, as Mr Frattini also said, that the number of data items transferred remains unchanged but that this agreement leaves open the possibility of new information being included on frequent flyers."
"I believe that this reference is open to numerous interpretations."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could explain what applies to the House?"
"Secondly, it was agreed to change from the pull system to the push system, meaning that the airlines will upgrade their own systems."
"Can the Commissioner tell us who will bear the cost of this changeover to the new system?"
"I fear that the cost will be passed on to passengers and tickets."
"Thirdly, I am worried about the retention of the term 'adequate' used to qualify the level of protection of data."
"Who in fact judges if the level is adequate?"
"Do the assurances being given by the American side suffice?"
"Can the Commissioner tell us what guarantees we have on actual data protection?"
"Finally, I believe that all this must be addressed in the new round of negotiations due to start in January."
"The new agreement must be more balanced than this one."
"Mr President, the temporary PNR agreement with the United States continues to treat as non-binding the US unilateral undertakings for the proper use and protection of personal data in the form of a protocol."
"Why?"
"And how is it possible that the European Council in this case concluded an agreement that seems more flexible on US obligations than even the agreement that a mere private company, SWIFT, was apparently able to negotiate with US authorities for the unacceptable transfer of banking data?"
"SWIFT, for example, has claimed that it can in real time block any US search if it violates the causes for which it has been agreed."
"The PNR and SWIFT cases reveal a dangerous political and legal black hole in the protection of our fundamental rights."
"A third country invoking exclusively reasons of its own national security can apparently impose upon Europe, including directly upon private companies, the level of access to, use, and even protection of, data."
"This is clearly unacceptable, and, while the whole EU pillar structure has de facto collapsed in these two cases, the Council insists upon denying Parliament the role of an equal partner in fighting terrorism and in protecting fundamental rights."
"What is now urgently needed is a comprehensive and democratic European approach in cooperation with all our partners on a global level to deal with these issues in the future."
"(FR) Mr President, in view of the large number of speakers and people present in this debate, I shall try not to tire you out even more."
"I agree with much of what has just been said, on a subject that is really very serious."
"I wish publicly to thank Mr Frattini for his efforts to inform our committee."
"I am speaking, in fact, as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs since Mrs in 't Veld has already spoken on behalf of my group."
"I shall make two observations, the first concerning the political climate."
"I believe that, in the context of the forthcoming negotiations, there needs to be more effort made towards the notion of reciprocity."
"I want to speak about reciprocity of the information that we agree to supply to the American services: what can we hope to obtain in return?"
"I have good reason to wonder because, whilst it is true that we Europeans need to be able to land in the United States, particularly for business purposes, one must not underestimate the same need on the part of American companies because a lot of business is done in Europe."
"We are therefore in a relatively balanced position."
"My second observation concerns the future."
"This interim agreement lapses in July 2007, and it will therefore be necessary to prepare the follow up, no doubt from the end of the coming winter."
"Given the numerous questions posed by the grey areas in this agreement, particularly - and this worries me a bit - the explanatory letter to which Mrs in 't Veld alluded just now, does it seem unreasonable to you, Mr Vice-President, to hope to build some sort of compromise by the next United States/Europe summit, that is to say by April 2007?"
"Can one hope to build a kind of transatlantic Schengen on the basis of which the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, could establish a framework making it possible to sort out both the problem of the demands of security and that of the protection of citizens?"
"We have a right to a new political structure as, in a few months time, we shall be entering into the negotiation of a new agreement."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most honest opinion we can express is that we have agreed to blackmail, since unfortunately Europe has in this matter been subjected to blackmail by the United States; that is to say, the US is dealing with single Member States and airlines, which is why we have in practice been coerced into concluding the agreement in question."
"This - I repeat - is the most politically correct position, which Parliament must express."
"However, it is as if we are having to defend an agreement that effectively damages European citizens: it is in fact true that nothing has changed, but the agreement that has been annulled by the Court of Justice was a very bad agreement."
"We would have to put into the hands of the American authorities 34 personal data items, of which, as the Americans themselves testify, only seven or eight would normally be used."
"If that is how things are, I do not understand why we have to hand over all this information and, furthermore, to put it in the hands of the American intelligence services - a new feature of the agreement - unless anyone maintains that we can trust the CIA."
"I do not believe that I am speaking just for myself;"
"I consider rather that this Parliament has every reason not to trust the CIA."
"What has happened in Europe is clear for all to see: Parliament has even set up a special commission on CIA activities in Europe, and there have been discussions on what happened with SWIFT, when it was discovered that our bank accounts were being inspected by the Americans."
"I therefore remain puzzled and still believe that we cannot trust the activities of United States intelligence agencies."
"I believe that the agreement in question was not negotiated in the name of European citizens; it certainly was not negotiated in the name of this Parliament, which was completely ignored in the discussion, as Mrs in 't Veld recalled a short time ago."
"In my opinion we must instead involve the European Parliament, just as we need to involve national parliaments, so that this agreement is reached in such a way as to give priority to defending the rights of EU citizens and, above all, ensuring that our personal data is not put into the hands of persons who will certainly not make fitting use of it."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner."
"It is not a perfect agreement."
"When compromises have to be made, agreements are never perfect, but, as Mrs in 't Veld said, it was either an agreement or no agreement."
"If there was no agreement, we would have had data anarchy and certainly no EU-wide protection for our citizens."
"I want to associate myself fully with the comments of Mr Cavada, who I believe has taken a really constructive approach."
"We need to look at what is happening with PNR and we need to look at what is happening with SWIFT - incidentally, the memorandum of understanding that SWIFT managed to negotiate is a good basis upon which to build any future negotiations."
"But we can see it also as an opportunity to create this so-called Schengen transatlantic area, because we will come up against these problems time and time again."
"However, I should like to say to this House that nothing is being imposed on us."
"The choice is ours."
"If we wish to travel to the United States, we will have to abide by conditions set by the United States."
"If we want to set up a business in the United States, exactly the same principle applies."
"We have to negotiate for our common good and this interim agreement is a step in that direction."
"Congratulations, Commissioner!"
"The easiest thing in the world is to knock something; the hardest is to support it."
"Well done."
"(DE) Mr President, I must admit that I see some aspects quite differently from the previous speaker, but Mr Cashman and I have a relationship of friendly disagreement, and it actually works quite well."
"Nonetheless, I think it most regrettable that the Council is no longer present, as it is clear from the speech on its behalf that neither was it present at the negotiations nor does it know the substance of this agreement."
"It is not possible to speak of any gain in data protection if we have adopted the same amount in this regard as before, namely nothing - as twice nothing is still nothing."
"We still do not know where the data retrieved will end up."
"We do not know which authority in the United States has access to them, and thus where they will be stored in the end, let alone where they will be transmitted."
"We do not know when they will be deleted."
"European citizens are not entitled to enquire where these data are."
"They are not entitled to require that the data be corrected."
"It is not true, therefore, that we have achieved more in essence."
"I am not accusing the Commissioner personally, as I know the pressure the United States has exerted, but I should have liked us to have put up more resistance to this pressure and, for example, taken up my colleague Mr Cavada's suggestion in saying that, if the US expects data from us, it has to hand its own over too."
"Who says there cannot be any threat to the EU from the USA?"
"Who says that we do not also have the right to learn who is travelling into our territory?"
"We must be able to pay the US back in the same coin in this case instead of just yielding to its pressure."
"Mr President, the Presidency said that the final outcome is a success, but I say it is a sell-out."
"We are told that data protection will be in compliance with relevant European standards, but I read in paragraph 3 that the Americans will process data in accordance with applicable US laws, and in paragraph 1 that data will be handed over as required by the Department of Homeland Security."
"Then we have the accompanying US side letter which says that they will interpret the agreement as laid down by President Bush's executive decrees on data sharing and access by other agencies."
"This is a complete assertion of US jurisdiction, so I would like to ask Commissioner Fratini to tell us whether he accepts this accompanying US side letter as an intrinsic part of the agreement."
"Paragraph 6 of the agreement says that the Department of Homeland Security is 'deemed' to ensure an adequate level of data protection."
"Now what on earth does 'deemed' mean?"
"Paragraph 1 says that we are relying on US continued implementation of the undertakings as interpreted in the light of subsequent events."
"So we are at the mercy of events to tell us if the US will respect its undertakings!"
"So the Presidency assertion that the earlier undertakings continue to apply is baseless."
"The Commission and the Council say that the agreement delivers legal certainty for EU citizens."
"I agree with this only in one respect: the certainty that their legal rights have been sold down the river, or rather across the pond."
"This is not theoretical; we have heard all this year on the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, regarding people about whom soft information has been transferred to the United States that has become hard information, leading to people being rendered to places like Syria and tortured for months or years or incarcerated in Guantánamo Bay."
"This is not theoretical."
"Mrs Lehtomäki has had to return to Finland - data-free - because it is the Indian Summit tomorrow, so there will be no reply from the Council in this debate."
"Vice-President of the Commission. (IT) Mr President, I believe that in the next few months there will be a debate with Parliament - because I confirm my personal willingness and that of the Commission to maintain a political dialogue with Parliament, even when we start on the negotiation phase with the United States of America - which in my opinion must presuppose a desire for mutual understanding, based in turn on familiarity with the official records on the subject."
"I have heard some Members speaking about personal data being sent to the CIA: it is simply not true."
"You must read the official records, honourable Members."
"It is clear from these that neither the CIA nor the other American secret services will have access to this data."
"This is a fact, established by the official documents - which we have checked."
"It is not true to assert that we are putting the data in question into the hands of the secret services without any checking."
"For this reason I am willing to engage in dialogue, but on the basis of shared data."
"By the same token, it is untrue to assert that data sent to the Department of Homeland Security is then sent to all the agencies."
"That is definitely not the case."
"We send data only to those agencies that are entrusted with the task of either undertaking investigations or dealing with terrorism."
"These are the two conditions that place a limit on who receives the data."
"A request for personal data has to be made on a case-by-case basis, and the undertakings specify what is meant by 'case-by-case'."
"Looked at in this way, therefore, the agreement - signed but not yet ratified - is in no way different from the earlier one."
"The earlier one may not please you, but it has not been changed nor made worse."
"Some observations have been made concerning the entering into force of the agreement: for example, Mr Roure has referred to Article 24."
"You know very well, Mr Roure, that national parliaments have the right - and in some cases the obligation - to ratify agreements."
"You know equally well, however, that this temporary agreement has been negotiated very urgently to avoid the anarchy to which Mr Cashman has referred."
"Anarchy means the absence of rules and of protection and the possibility that any bunch of people could sign an agreement."
"It is therefore clear that we shall apply Article 24 of the agreement, including the part that states that it will come into force immediately."
"If we were to await all the ratifications, this agreement would come into effect after July 2007, whereupon the immediate anarchy that we wanted to avoid would be caused."
"We are talking about rules laid down in the Treaties, not of an interpretation of our own."
"We have repeated that '[A]n adequate level of data protection is guaranteed'."
"This is a formula that existed previously."
"I have been asked a serious question: how can we protect the citizen or indeed the European Community if this adequate level is not maintained?"
"Honourable Members, you know that the undertakings and the agreement envisage the possibility of denouncing the agreement and maybe of suspending it, if it were to emerge that the 'adequate level of protection' had not been maintained."
"So there are suitable instruments; and if it were necessary to resort to legal procedures, it would certainly not be for me to establish in what cases a magistrate could invoke his jurisdiction."
"I have received objections to the existence of a covering letter that establishes the application of a certain jurisdiction, for example only United States jurisdiction."
"You know full well, however, that this letter is a unilateral act, not part of the agreement."
"The Commission has not agreed any dispositions concerning jurisdiction that might be contained in a unilateral letter from the State Department."
"Therefore it is absolutely untrue that we are surrendering our rights concerning jurisdiction."
"It is up to the judges to establish who can or cannot act."
"This will certainly not be established by the agreement under discussion."
"I believe that there is another particularly important matter: the 'push-pull' aspect."
"Mrs in 't Velt has asked some complicated questions, seventeen in all, to which we shall naturally reply in writing: they are very technical questions, but important."
"However, there are other points to which I must now respond."
"It is simply not true that, according to the agreement, the new 'push' system that Parliament wants will come into force when the Americans want it."
"On the contrary, we have it in writing that 'by December at the latest, the system will be operational'."
"The agreement therefore refers to a date that is very clear and close - one and a half months away - and, as you well know, there is a network of international airlines, headed by the Amadeus chain, that is already in a position to apply the 'push' system tomorrow."
"There thus exists the technical capacity and there is also a juridical basis, which was not contemplated in the previous agreement."
"This is certainly an improvement: the 'push' system can come into operation from tomorrow."
"As far as the limited scope of the agreement is concerned, someone - I think it was again Mrs in 't Velt - stated that the transmission of data would no longer be justified only by the war on terrorism but also by other objectives."
"Points 3 and 34 of the undertakings, which have not been modified, established and still establish that, in the event of a matter of life and death, including cases other than specific investigation of terrorism, personal data may be requested."
"This is nothing new."
"One more thing, Mr President, and I apologise for the length of my speech."
"I am in full agreement with what Mr Cavada and Mr Cashman said: we can also call it the 'Transatlantic Schengen Agreement' (I like that title)."
"Certainly there will have to be wide-ranging political negotiations with the United States."
"We shall need to establish once and for all - and Parliament will also have to do this - whether the United States is, as I believe, Europe's foremost ally in the war on terrorism, or whether it is a problem."
"I consider it to be our foremost ally in the war on terrorism; this being so, it is clear that, just as we Europeans have constructed the Schengen area of security and affirmation of rights, we must start doing the same thing with the United States."
"Otherwise, we risk forgetting that the problem is terrorism, not the US."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner and all colleagues who took part in that important debate."
"The debate is closed."
"Footwear from China and Vietnam (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the definitive results of the anti-dumping investigation concerning footwear from China and Vietnam, by Enrique Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0432/2006)."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am replacing my colleague Peter Mandelson in this debate."
"Peter is currently on his way to the EU-India Summit with Minister Lehtomäki and he really is on duty because we have many important trade policies to discuss with India."
"Last week the Council adopted the measures proposed by the Commission to tackle the dumping of Chinese and Vietnamese footwear in the European Union."
"These measures offer a balanced solution in a complex case; a solution which responds to the clear evidence of unfair competitive practices and state intervention which has enabled Chinese and Vietnamese companies to engage in dumping in the European Union."
"The measures now adopted will help to redress the situation."
"They offer some comfort to footwear producers in the Union while taking into account both the interests of consumers and the changing structure of the sector within the Union, where many household names in the footwear sector now choose to manufacture outside the Union."
"This is in fact a case study of our ability to respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by globalisation."
"The full findings of the investigation are set out in the measures which we published on 6 October, as well as the details of how we established the level of dumping and injury to EU industry and determined the appropriate level of duties in this case."
"This information is in the public domain and is of course, as in every other case, open to public and, ultimately, judicial scrutiny."
"With regard to the possible use of a deferred duty scheme, it is correct that the Commission considered such an approach as a possible response to this case."
"Such a novel approach would indeed have had certain advantages, but it did not command the support of a majority of Member States."
"The Commission listened to the concerns of the Member States and in late August presented the measures which have just been adopted by the Council."
"In formulating the level of duty, the Commission applied the 'lesser-duty rule', which is part of our existing legal framework and entirely consistent with the international framework applying to anti-dumping."
"This rule allows the Commission to set levels of duty which reflect the actual damage being suffered by EU industry rather than the level of dumping established in the investigation."
"This is not in itself a novel approach."
"At the same time, given the nature of this sector, where quotas on shoe imports applied up to 2005, this was an important factor which needed to be taken into account in determining the appropriate level of duty to be applied."
"Nevertheless, the situation is specific to this particular case, and, while each case must be judged on its own merits, particularly when we face globalisation, it does not as such represent a fundamental change in the way we deal with trade defence cases."
"Let me conclude by highlighting that the kinds of challenges posed in the shoes case cannot be ignored."
"This is why, as part of our push to strengthen our external competitiveness, the Commission will publish a Green Paper in December looking at how our trade defence instruments operate in the context of economic globalisation."
"I am very much looking forward to that debate and I believe we need to work together to look for practical, sensible improvements that will reinforce the ability of Europe's businesses to compete fairly in a global marketplace."
"I am very much looking forward to Parliament's active participation in this debate."
"I should like to apologise to Mr Barón Crespo that I gave the speaking order incorrectly."
"He should of course have had the floor first in order to put the question to the Commission."
"Mr Mandelson is not present for the reasons Commissioner Rehn has explained."
"He is flying with Minister Lehtomäki to Finland for the EU-India Summit."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, I had two complaints and I shall add another, since I find what is happening in this House today to be absolutely intolerable."
"Firstly, it shows disrespect towards Parliament to change our rules and make the substitute Commissioner reply before I have the opportunity to put my question."
"Secondly, the absence of the Council."
"There is no justification for it, and we raised this today in the Conference of Committee Chairmen: there is no justification for the absence of the Council, particularly given that the Council's role in this issue is currently very much in question, in terms of the impartiality it has shown in considering it."
"The Finnish Presidency - and I say this with very great regret, since Finland is exemplary in terms of transparency - has not acted correctly, and Mrs Lehtomäki should have given explanations."
"With regard to Commissioner Mandelson - and I say this to Commissioner Rehn so that he can pass it on, and I will say a little more - if Commissioner Mandelson were in a State school, his parents would have been called because of their son's truancy: because he was not here at the September sitting to debate the report on India; today he has had to leave; he is not going to be here for Mercosur ..."
"Yes, it is very important to talk with India in Helsinki, but it is more important to be where the executive should be, which is in this Parliament talking to its Members."
"Mr President, with regard to the fundamental issue, I must say that we support the Commission: we support it and we entirely disagree with some people's two-dimensional stereotypical view that there are either pro-free trade countries or protectionist countries in this field."
"The Commission is taking a balanced approach; we act here jointly and with solidarity, and we are in a very serious situation."
"It is said that there is protectionism; well we must protect our workers, for example."
"At the moment I can tell you that the last industry remaining in France, in Alsace, manufacturing safety footwear, which is very important, is going to go to the Court of Justice, because the differences are of 40% - bearing in mind that we are asking for antidumping measures in the form of a tariff of 10% to 20% - and the footwear coming in does not conform to the minimum safety standards."
"This is not therefore a debate that divides the European Union into those who are in favour of doing the right thing and those who want to close the doors."
"This is a debate in which we are calling for compliance with the rules that we have agreed within the World Trade Organisation."
"In its work, the Commission has acted correctly, though it has not done so today when it comes to Commissioner Mandelson's absence."
"We therefore believe that the Commission should treat such an important issue as this with greater respect."
"Other issues are very important too, but the President and I have missed many planes in order to fulfil our duties."
"If there is a Summit tomorrow, they should get up early or arrange things in some other way; but where they should be today is here."
"Your point is very well made, Mr Barón Crespo, and your own experience as President will tell you how difficult it is to keep some of our speakers to their speaking time."
"I note that in earlier debates this afternoon Mr Frattini and Mr Barroso spoke jointly for more than 42 minutes."
"I cannot apologise on behalf of Mr Mandelson, but I think Mr Rehn has explained the situation."
"I am sure your remarks will be conveyed to Mr Mandelson by Mr Rehn."
"Mr President, I endorse Mr Barón Crespo's objections concerning the Commission's conduct on such crucial discussions."
"The question of antidumping duties on footwear has divided the Member States of the Union."
"It has also highlighted conflicting interests between manufacturers, on the one hand, and suppliers and consumers, on the other."
"We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, continue to advocate multilateralism and open and balanced international trade."
"However, I consider the arguments put forward against the adoption of the measures in question, by which I mean protectionism for the benefit of the industry and the passing on of the cost to European consumers, to be misleading and unsubstantiated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it must be made clear that the imposition of duties is a justified legal commercial defence measure or, if you like, a productive protective measure."
"By contrast, dumping practices are a primary protective measure - and one which distorts trade."
"Given, therefore, that the application of dumping practices and the damage caused by them to the European industry have been confirmed, the failure to take measures would mean tolerance of unfair competition."
"To all those who put forward the argument of better prices against the imposition of duties I ask: did consumers benefit from the reduction in import prices following liberalisation?"
"Clearly not."
"As the Commission itself confirms, there was no benefit to the European consumer, given that prices remained stable or even increased slightly in certain instances."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should send a clear message: yes to competition; no to its manifest or concealed distortion."
"The Union is and will remain an open market to partners who respect the rules and disciplines of the multilateral trade system."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, frankly I am dismayed by this decision to impose tariffs on shoes for two reasons: firstly, because a large number of European consumers are going to be asked to pay more for their footwear in order to bring dubious benefits to a small number of European producers."
"I particularly regret the fact that children's footwear has been included in this."
"If you are a relatively low-paid parent of a young child, who has to buy new footwear regularly, this imposition is a serious one and I regret that we have taken this action."
"The second reason I am dismayed is the way the majority in Council was allegedly - and I say allegedly because I have no hard proof of this - put together."
"I understand that Latvia was persuaded to change its vote, which was nothing to do with shoes, but because Italy promised then not to vote for GSP sanctions on Belarus."
"Because Latvia trades extensively with Belarus, this was a big hook for the Latvians."
"That sort of horse-trading, if it is true, brings both the European Union as a whole and the Council in particular into disrepute."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, may I first of all associate myself with the comments of complaint that were raised by Mr Barón Crespo."
"Commissioner, the EU's move last week to slap duties on the imports of shoes from China and Vietnam not only went against the will of the majority of Europe - a number of Member States have clearly undertaken horse-trading and have now abandoned their declared positions - it has also raised the possibility of the EU being reprimanded before the WTO as many question the factual and legal basis of the Commission's investigation."
"Protectionism was the fuel behind this short-sighted, sticking-plaster measure."
"Duties are quick fixes which only hurt those EU industries that have actually adapted to the global economy."
"Britain's Clarks Shoes, for example, has first of all shown foresight, in relocating production of shoes to China and Vietnam; responsibility, in diversifying into retail outlets in the UK, where they now employ more people than they ever employed in shoemaking; and, not least, understanding, in recognising the Commission's difficulties and trying to work with you and not against you."
"Yet, because of last week's ill-thought-out measures, Clarks is now being penalised for all three, as European retailers and consumers are now expected to foot the bill for an ailing Italian manufacturing industry."
"It is short-sighted, too, for whilst Commissioner Mandelson is rolling out his plans for stronger bilateral links with emerging economies in Asia, it has incensed the Chinese, cut across EU-sponsored poverty reduction and hunger eradication programmes in Vietnam and shown an EU protectionist red flag to the region."
"I fear that Commissioner Mandelson's review of the EU's anti-dumping rules comes a year too late."
"The naming and shaming of retailers who do not forward the benefit of cheap imports to the consumer is a smokescreen for the Commission's poor management of the challenges of globalisation."
"On this one, the Commission has failed miserably."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the Council's decision concerning duties on shoes from China and Vietnam is another example of the EU's protectionism."
"The decision is an assault on the multilateral agreement system and, specifically, the Multifibre Agreement, and it excessively punishes those Member States that have managed to comply with the agreement."
"The duties hits, for example, Denmark, which has transferred its production of shoes to China and only retained the design and marketing aspects in Denmark."
"Even worse, the EU is now undermining the WTO and the multilateral agreement system."
"It is also remarkable that the Commissioner does not even listen to people when they are talking."
"Even though he is Finnish, he is unable, when standing over there, to understand my Danish."
"I would point out to the President that this is completely unacceptable."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Commissioner Mandelson will now pin his hopes on bilateral trading agreements."
"The justification for this is that, as long as the WTO route is barred, we must find new ways."
"I would point out, however, that it is, in actual fact, the EU that, together with the United States, is mainly responsible for the WTO negotiations having stalled."
"No doubt there are indeed problems involving human rights, interest rate policy and environmental standards, but they must not be solved through protectionism."
"They must be solved through binding multilateral cooperation."
"Strengthening the bilateral approach will only buttress poor countries' dependence on the EU."
"It is a poorly disguised continuation of colonial exploitation."
"Commissioner Mandelson calls the bilateral agreements 'stepping stones' to better global trade."
"They are not that, however."
"On the contrary. They entail a rejection of the WTO and the multilateral trading system and thus also of the ideals of fair and free trade and of the fight against poverty, which the Commission otherwise emphasises as its global vision."
"With the bilateral strategy, that vision is just empty words."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, we feel that the problem with the measures decided by the Council is that they are overdue, that they will have a limited impact and that they fall short of what is needed in a sector that has a good future ahead of it and that is very important to Portugal and the EU."
"Commissioner, you will certainly be aware of the reality of the closure and relocation of many companies and the loss of jobs in the footwear industry in Portugal, the result of which has been an increase in unemployment and the danger of thousands of workers falling into poverty."
"Once again, let me highlight the case of the workers of the multinational C [amp] J Clark in Castelo de Paiva who, three years after the company's closure and following repeated promises, remain without alternative employment."
"In other words, with the liberalisation of world trade, the workers employed by innumerable micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the footwear industry in the EU have been the losers."
"Those who have gained most, on the other hand, from the huge rise in footwear imports from third countries have not been the so-called consumers but, rather, the large multinationals and the major importers and distributors, which have made tremendous profits, as the Commission has acknowledged."
"If international trade as a whole were properly looking after the consumers' interests, it could have long since significantly reduced the selling price of imported footwear."
"As we have pointed out, the responsibility for this situation does not lie with third countries, but with the EU and its policies of promoting competition and liberalising international trade, as well as maintaining the value of the euro, a policy that hampers manufacturing industries such as the footwear industry."
"Just last week, as a matter of fact, the Commission declared its intention to increase bilateral free-trade treaties, thereby launching a fresh crusade to liberalise world trade."
"It is this policy that should be brought into question."
"Mr President, just last year, a total of 1 billion 250 million pairs of shoes from China came onto the European market."
"That is half of all the shoes sold in the European Union during that time."
"Meanwhile, since 2001, production of leather footwear in Europe has fallen by almost 30%."
"In the European Union shoe sector almost 40 000 jobs have been lost during this period."
"The situation in Poland is similar."
"In 2001, Poland imported only 300 000 pairs of Chinese-made shoes."
"Now the figure is 9 million pairs per annum."
"This has had a direct knock-on effect on employment in the sector."
"In 2003, the shoe-making industry in Poland consisted of 123 firms, while in 2005 there were only 93."
"At the same time, employment in the industry fell from almost 17 000 to 13 000, with production falling from 18 to 15 million pairs. What is more, it is not the consumer who has benefited from these huge imports through lower prices, as is generally thought, but the importers themselves, who often add profit margins exceeding 100% of the transaction value."
"In this situation it is good that the European Commission has finally decided to impose tariffs to protect the European market, and in particular that experts from the Commission have established beyond all doubt that China is using dumping prices."
"Governments such as China and Vietnam are unfairly supporting their manufacturers through tax concessions, the provision of free land, and also by absolving them of the full costs of manufacture, for example by waiving environmental taxes."
"The only regret is that this has come so late in the day, after the European shoemaking industry has suffered so badly."
"The European Commission must do everything in its power to prevent such a situation from repeating itself in any other sector of the economy."
"What is more, decisions on how to react to the sale of goods at dumping prices within the European customs area must be made quickly to limit the damage such imports cause to manufacturing, and therefore to employment in the European Union."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally disagree with the fact that the Council and the Commission have adopted the Mandelson proposal and in the last few days have imposed high customs duties on footwear from Vietnam and China."
"I feel that this is a short-term measure that is tantamount to anti-liberal protectionism and that does not in any way help European competitiveness."
"This is just prolonging the agony for these manufacturers who fight hard to adjust to the reality of the global economy."
"By introducing customs duties the politicians paradoxically punish those amongst the businessmen who have come to understand the rules of the global economy and, in a show of flexibility, have moved production to Asia and managed to hold their own under the new market conditions."
"The introduction of customs duties also ultimately works against the consumer, given that the cost of a pair of shoes has gone up by EUR 7."
"I should like to know which Head of State or which Commissioner will be going out in person to explain to families with many children that when they buy more expensive shoes they are not buying higher quality, but are subsidising inefficient footwear companies."
"(PT) In imposing the anti-dumping tax on leather footwear imports from China and Vietnam, the EU took a good decision, albeit a long overdue one."
"Still, better late than never."
"We are all aware that China and Vietnam export various products around the world, including footwear and textiles, which enjoy major state intervention at source."
"Examples of this state intervention include non-refundable loans, tax breaks, the artificial devaluation of the currency and, in some cases, the non-depreciation of investments."
"These products continue to enjoy the total, or near-total, absence of social or environmental regulation, which accounts for a significant proportion of production costs in EU countries."
"European footwear manufacturers know that they have to compete with companies that manufacture products while paying their employees lower wages. They are opposed to the idea that competition should be distorted by this kind of intervention from exporting countries selling their goods below the production price."
"Where I come from, this is known as cheating."
"The EU has, albeit belatedly, made the right decision, but in watered-down form."
"What is happening shows that the authorities of these countries are unwilling to change their behaviour and, in view of their repeated unfair practices, I would have preferred the original version of the sanctions, which called for anti-dumping tariffs for five years, rather than for the two-year period that has finally been decided on."
"These measures were only supported by a narrow majority in the Council, only 13 out of 25 Member States."
"I should therefore like to ask, in conclusion, whether we will be able to hold on to that majority in two years' time?"
"If not, what will the EU do?"
"Let me be absolutely clear on this point, Commissioner. I am no advocate of protectionist policies."
"I just want everyone to play by the rules."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a strange conception, as Mr Barón Crespo said, of democratic debate and of the respect due to our institution if the Trade Commissioner and Finnish Presidency are not here to answer our legitimate questions."
"If the Commissioner had managed to get here, I would have had two questions for him."
"Why have the anti-dumping duties been imposed for two rather than five years, which is a first in the history of this instrument, and why are the duties so low when there is a blatant violation of the international trade rules and when businesses are suffering serious losses?"
"If the Finnish Presidency had honoured us with its presence, I would not have congratulated it on its biased coordination and on its unwavering support for the position of the big importers and distributors, at the expense of our own industry which is experiencing a number of tragic bankruptcies with the job losses that that entails."
"Once again, however, financial considerations have prevailed over social considerations and the vital solidarity between countries within the European Union, a solidarity which, if we keep on putting it to the test, tomorrow could end up being the exception and no longer the rule that unites us."
"To sum up, the position adopted means more unemployment in Europe, a missed opportunity to promote social norms and decent employment, and profit reserved only for importers and distributors: I cannot accept it."
"(LT) The European footwear market has shrunk by one third over the last five years as it is not able to compete with cheap production subsidised by the governments of Asian countries."
"With the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Chinese and Vietnamese leather footwear for the next two years, EU Member States trying to compete in the footwear manufacturing sector have won a temporary victory against those EU countries that have moved their production to Asia."
"Large sales networks, such as footwear importers from Asia, are also resisting the introduction of such duties."
"Market protection measures are necessary as long as the energy sector is subsidised, preferential duties are applied and the environment is being polluted in Asian countries."
"These measures will at least partially serve to reduce the differences between the operating conditions of European and Asian footwear manufacturers, albeit temporarily."
"The transfer of production to countries with cheaper workforces appears inevitable."
"The Earth is still round, and will the EU not be harmed after destroying its own manufacturing capabilities?"
"Why will the European Commission not consider a reform of the foreign trade policy of the WTO and the EU?"
"(PL) Mr President, footwear is a product whose quality has an important effect on our health and on comfortable walking."
"Its practicality and durability depend on the design, the method of manufacture and the materials used."
"Securing a basic standard for footwear entails certain costs."
"Very low-priced shoes may originate from subsidised production or manufacturers using very low-quality raw materials and technologies that do not meet health and consumer requirements."
"This should be taken into consideration when protecting the industry and consumers in the European Union."
"For this reason I believe that the introduction of anti-dumping duties is justified, as is the use of any other methods that would restrict the import of shoes that fall short of European requirements."
"(SV) Mr President, the introduction of duties on shoes from Vietnam and China is a splendid own-goal by the EU."
"It is bad economic policy and bad trade policy, and it is morally bankrupt."
"Allow me firstly to explain why it is bad economic policy."
"What we are doing at the moment, you see, is standing up for and defending those industries that are uncompetitive, at the same time as punishing those industries that have adjusted to globalisation, for example by moving their production to more competitive countries."
"In that way, we achieve the feat of weakening the EU's competitiveness two-fold by means of one and the same decision."
"I am afraid that the Commission's vision for the future is that the EU should compete globally using cheap shoes."
"I think the worst that could happen is that the Commission might succeed and that we would retain this industry."
"In that case, we shall be able, in 30 years, to expect to see Europe exporting shoes to Vietnam, while Vietnam exports cars, or an even higher-value product that we cannot even imagine, to Europe."
"Secondly, the introduction of these duties is bad trade policy."
"At the end of this month, Vietnam will become a member of the WTO."
"The EU's welcome present is duties on Vietnamese shoes."
"The signals we are sending to Vietnam, from one of the world's largest trading blocks, are a disaster, especially since the country is going through major changes in order to meet the requirements for future WTO membership."
"Thirdly, it is morally bankrupt because it hits individuals hard in order to satisfy small, well-organised special interests."
"You are not content to prolong the duties on shoes, but you are now also extending them to include children's shoes."
"What do you say to Swedish families with small children who may be forced to buy several pairs of children's shoes per year?"
"Do you think that families with children have too much money?"
"Have the previous measures allowed them to get off too lightly?"
"This is an example of the EU showing its very worst side, namely when well-organised special interests are allowed to come before the wellbeing of the people."
"That, I think, is something we must prevent from happening in the future."
"(PT) Advocates of free trade believe that trade protection instruments such as anti-dumping measures should only be adopted in extraordinary, objectively verified, circumstances."
"Unfortunately, such circumstances apply in this instance."
"China and Vietnam have been responsible for particularly unacceptable commercial practices in the footwear industry and have gone so far as to increase the numerous competitive advantages they already enjoy."
"By acting in this way, these two countries have breached one of the fundamental principles of free trade, namely that of fair competition."
"These measures are not, therefore, to be understood as being opposed to free trade, but as being, quite the opposite, a vital factor in protecting free trade in the long term."
"We must therefore applaud the Commission for what it has done in this area."
"It is, however, important to emphasise that European industry must keep up its efforts to modernise, by investing in innovation and in improving quality in order to increase its competitiveness in the sector around the world."
"This effort must involve the public authorities, with the rules of free and fair trade always being adhered to."
"The adoption of these measures must not, therefore, be seen as an attempt to reopen the door to unwanted protectionism, but rather as a vital instrument for ensuring that international trade is fairly regulated."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, in contrast to the previous speaker, I wish to say that if anyone believes that European jobs can be saved by placing duties on leather shoes from China and Vietnam, they should think again."
"That is simply not how things work."
"The fact is that production will, of course, merely move to other low-wage countries."
"The latest figures from Eurostat show that, since the duties were approved in the spring, shoe production has moved from China and Vietnam to countries such as India and Indonesia."
"The EU countries' inefficient producers gain nothing."
"The Commission maintains that dumping has taken place and says that it has presented all the practical results of the anti-dumping inquiry."
"I have to say that I can only find a few general documents."
"I think that there is a major democratic problem if decisions are taken on a casual or incomplete basis."
"It reinforces the impression that what we have here is political horse-trading, and I would therefore call on the Commission openly to present the results of all its investigations and to submit detailed analyses of the consequences that the shoe duties are having, and will have in the future, for European consumers and companies."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter addressed by Mr Barón Crespo's question flows from the case of the footwear sector, because the entire production system of Member States has been thrown into a crisis, and not merely from today, by unfair competition - or, to put it more plainly, by the remorseless and unbridled financial greed of the so-called free market: a market that would be better defined as being without rules, which preys on individuals like a vampire, exploiting workers without paying heed to their age and without any social security remotely comparable to that which is in force in countries of the European Union."
"It is a market with devastating financial interests that impoverishes society and nations, intent on the exponential enrichment of multinational companies."
"The trade defences such as anti-dumping measures, and thus the maintenance of tariffs, are the first and the minimum indispensable tool; but they are not entirely satisfactory, since the unfair competition that is in danger of flooding the markets with much cheaper products is the consequence of the huge advantages offered by production factors."
"Unfair competition should thus be fought not only by defensive means: one cannot attempt to win the war with rearguard battles, and defence does not guarantee victory in war, as strategists even before von Clausewitz have already noted."
"If, therefore, the European Union wishes to safeguard its producers, it must impose controls on the products that it aims to promote in the internal market."
"It is unthinkable to set off prices against production so long as the production factors are so unbalanced in favour of Asian industry - unbalanced in respect of costs not only of labour but also, for example, of administration."
"At the start of this parliamentary term, I tabled an oral question in accordance with Article 108, with dozens of signatures in support of colleagues of various nationalities and political leanings."
"It was obviously not put down for the debate, perhaps because it clashed with the interests of those who, in the name of profit, despise social considerations and the profound importance of employment."
"I said then - and I remain of the same view - that, as well as imposing restrictions on imports from countries that do not give guarantees as mentioned earlier, it is time to institute a control mechanism that would certify how products imported into Europe are made, whatever non-European country they come from, and that would in consequence authorise or prohibit the trade."
"Let us impose a trade mark of ethical certification - ethical as regards employment and the environment and, more generally, ethical as regards the production process."
"Karl Popper was undoubtedly a supporter of free trade, but he summarised perfectly the extent to which liberty cannot be considered ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly reject the view that anti-dumping is tantamount to harmful protectionism."
"In fact, the opposite is true."
"For Europe, there is nothing worse than taking a benevolent view of the unfair trade practices of third countries whilst imposing very strict requirements on European manufacturers."
"We should not be surprised that European firms have moved production to Asia, where they can make the most of low social and environmental standards, in such a way that they can sell poor quality shoes, textiles, electronic equipment and other goods cheaply and at huge profits to Europeans who are, moreover, losing jobs on their home markets."
"Countries that have joined the EU adhere to trade rules and cannot by themselves impose official sanctions against third countries."
"That is a competence of the Union."
"This is why it is important for the Commission to take action on this occasion. I am concerned about inconsistency, however."
"After all, children's and sports shoes from China and Vietnam are also sold at dumping prices."
"Their exclusion from these measures simply on the grounds that sports shoes are no longer made in Europe, or even on the grounds that poor quality children's shoes will be a help to poor families, is a sign of Europe's weakness."
"The previous exclusion of children's shoes which were demonstrably harmful to children's health showed a gross failure of professionalism on the Commission's part."
"I believe that in this case we should follow the principle of mutually monitoring the agreed rules and not simply surrendering to European wholesalers, who often benefit from our lack of thoroughness in these matters."
"We are all aware that we are talking about just a few euros, which will make no impact on the generous profits that the consumer does not see."
"The Council statement showed that governments are not interested in principle, but in concrete trade interests that differ across the north-south divide."
"I hope that at least here in Parliament we uphold the principles of fair competition irrespective of whom it suits in Europe or otherwise."
"It is our duty to support the Commission and to warn the Council against any such policy. To conclude, I should like to call on the Commission once again to address the issue of compulsory certification for children's footwear that is sold in Europe, regardless of who has produced it."
"Shoes should be healthy, whether they are made by the Chinese, the Japanese, or anyone else."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this debate were to be confined to weighing up the arguments for and against anti-dumping measures for leather footwear from China and Vietnam, it would truly serve no purpose."
"European countries are divided on this issue because producers' interests are in conflict with those of distributors."
"This is a statement of fact, not a matter for outrage."
"We should be asking a different question: does a common European interest exist?"
"How would one define it?"
"In my opinion we can and must try to define it, because a divided Europe is a weaker Europe."
"However, it can be done only if we start from a strategic and realistic vision of Europe's position in the market and in world trade and remain bound by principles and figures."
"One of these principles is the defence of the European consumer: among other things, the producers' requirement, that is to say the 'made in', is sacrosanct: first of all, because it signifies more information and therefore more openness (this is a European principle); and, secondly, because it transpires that a drastic fall in the costs of importing leather shoes has not in fact been matched by a reduction in retail prices."
"On the contrary, it has become clear that there exist in Europe unearned incomes from this situation and that these too are a cause of the danger."
"The tariffs that have been imposed for two years are a reasonable compromise measure, which also endorses a correct method of respecting the interests of all parties."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here with us today."
"I would like briefly to communicate to the Council my relative satisfaction with the agreement reached on 4 October: satisfaction because it has finally been agreed that action should be taken to counter the sale of shoes from China and Vietnam below real costs prices."
"I say relative satisfaction, because this kind of tariff measure is usually in force for five years rather than the two years that the Council has agreed to."
"Those of us from Spain and the Balearic Islands are calling upon the Commission and the Council to leave open the possibility of extending these duties, since the problem of unfair competition will still be there in two years' time."
"Furthermore, in the region that I represent, the Balearic Islands, one of the regions most active in defending equal conditions in the marketing of footwear in the European markets, we believe that the tariffs provided for in the Council's agreement are low compared to those applied during the provisional period that ended on 6 October: the temporary tariff of 19% for Chinese footwear is becoming 16%, and in the case of footwear from Vietnam it is falling from 16.8% to 10%."
"For the Balearic Islands and for my country, the fundamental issue is to defend equal conditions in the marketing of footwear, conditions that exclude this kind of dumping practice."
"We are not therefore talking about imposing protectionist measures that hinder free trade, but rather about taking measures to combat unfair competition."
"(EL) Mr President, the recent decision by the Council of Ministers to impose antidumping duties leads me to two crucial comments."
"The first concerns the efficacy of the common trade policy and the mechanisms which it has at its disposal to defend European interests."
"Unfortunately, yet again China, as a member of the World Trade Organisation, is continuing its dumping practices through its state policy, whereas the European Commission is continuing, for its part, to monitor this practice as a neutral observer."
"On the other hand, we have Vietnam, which is also continuing to take dumping measures, while at the same time seeking to join the World Trade Organisation."
"I believe that the European Commission must also send a message to the Vietnamese authorities, given that it wishes to join the World Trade Organisation."
"My second comment is more serious and concerns the very future of the European Union and the defence of the European productive fabric."
"In Europe there are not only consumers, whose interests we must of course defend; there are also workers who are losing their jobs and remaining unemployed."
"There are imports, on the one hand, but there are also productive businesses and sectors of industry which must be able to compete in a secure international environment free from distortion."
"Europe cannot become a jungle of uncontrolled imports in the name of the liberalisation of international trade."
"(HU) China and Vietnam are subsidising the export of footwear in an unacceptable manner."
"These subsidies are contrary to WTO rules."
"This State aid causes market distortions and results in dumping."
"The market distorting subsidies cause serious harm to European producers and the European economy, attested to by the fact that several tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in recent times."
"That is why the introduction of anti-dumping measures is justified from a legal and economic point of view."
"It is not true that such anti-dumping measures are protectionist but, on the contrary, it is the Chinese and Vietnamese states that are using protectionist, market-distorting measures."
"The aim of the anti-dumping duties is precisely to offset the effects of China's and Vietnam's protectionist, market-distorting practices. Thank you very much."
"(NL) Mr President, while northern Europe considers the anti-dumping measures to be protectionist, and brandishes consumer interests to back up its argument, southern Europe considers the measures to be inadequate to protect their shoe industry against unfair competition."
"This gap in the EU is increasing, and with it the mistrust."
"Dumping is not the same thing as fair competition or reduced costs."
"Dumping is unfair competition, whether that is because the dumping companies receive state support or whether they use child labour to keep wages down."
"Where dumping is going on, we must close ranks."
"We cannot simply dismiss unfair competition if, for once, it appears insignificant in comparison with the benefits for the entire community."
"It is unfortunate that the government of my own country, the Netherlands, uses this very argument against taking anti-dumping measures."
"How arbitrary of them!"
"Who, though, stands to benefit?"
"Not the European consumers, because last year, although import prices for shoes from outside the EU dropped by 25%, consumer prices remained the same."
"Does the Commissioner agree with me that we must work on a new anti-dumping policy that rules out arbitrariness and brings unity in the EU?"
"We must protect ourselves against unfair competition."
"We must protect both our producers and consumers."
"Surely they do not want to buy products that are made by children?"
"We must strive for clean clothes, clean shoes and clean hands."
"Mr President, the impact of these tariffs will be to increase shoe prices for my constituents in London at a time when families, especially those on lower incomes, are already facing higher energy bills."
"With these tariffs, the EU has effectively levied a tax on consumers in a vain attempt to protect shoe manufacturers in certain countries who need to face up to the fact that they cannot produce shoes more cheaply than Asian countries."
"Globalisation is a reality; we in Europe should not be burying our head in the sand and hiding from it."
"The most successful European companies have embraced globalisation and outsourced low-value manufacturing to China and Vietnam."
"We are also deluding ourselves if we believe that duties imposed on Chinese and Vietnamese shoes will lead to more European jobs."
"Retailers will simply fill the gaps with more imports from other countries such as India and Indonesia, and indeed this has been shown to be the case."
"When will we realise that free trade is good for European consumers and creates more and better jobs in the long run?"
"It may be painful for some, but the EU will gain in the longer term."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you all for your contributions."
"They reflect the justifiable concerns of industry and employees, and important considerations as far as consumers are concerned."
"I will convey the outcome of this debate to Commissioner Mandelson, and also, obviously, to all my colleagues."
"This is a very important issue, and we will be monitoring it continually."
"Right from the start we realised that this would be a very tough and complicated case, and, after a thorough investigation, the Commission in April imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs."
"All the conditions of anti-dumping tariffs were met; there is no doubt about that."
"The report showed that China and Vietnam practise dumping, as a result of which it was in the Community's interests to intervene."
"Several speeches, like the one just now, mentioned consumer prices."
"We have looked into this in detail, and these investigations show that in all likelihood these solutions will have no effect on consumer prices."
"This is because there is, I would say, very considerable added value between import and consumer prices."
"The average import price is EUR 8, while every one of us knows that shoes in a shop normally cost many times more than that."
"Consequently, the effect of anti-dumping tariffs will be minimal, and in any case they apply to just 11% of the Union's total imports."
"As I said, Mr President, I will convey the content and spirit of this debate to Mr Mandelson."
"(ES) Mr President, I take note of Commissioner Rehn's expression of disapproval, but I believe that what has happened today must be looked into by the Presidency and the Conference of Presidents, because it shows a lack of respect for Parliament, particularly on the part of the Council."
"As for the Commission, I hope that it will sort out its issues at home and continue to work in favour of European interests."
"Thank you, your remarks are noted."
"That concludes the debate."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(PT) If we are to protect manufacturing and jobs with rights, the Commission and the Council must focus more on the industrial manufacturing sectors in each Member State and must not only take into account the interests of the large economic groups involved in world trade."
"Sectors such as footwear, textiles and clothing have been particularly hard hit by the disastrous policy of liberalising world trade, within the framework of the WTO."
"Thousands of jobs have been lost."
"In Portugal alone, jobs have been lost in the footwear factories of C[amp]J Clarks in Arouca, Castelo de Paiva and Vila Nova de Gaia, of Rodhe in Tancosco and of Ara in Avintes. Hundreds of jobs have also been lost at Ecco and Rodhe in Santa Maria da Feira, and many others in the area of Felgueiras."
"This policy does not only affect the workers, and the countless micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; it also hinders regional development in huge areas in countries such as Portugal."
"Fresh measures must therefore be adopted, and, as a minimum, the period for maintaining customs barriers must be extended, with a view to protecting manufacturing, as well as employment with rights."
"(FR) I am very pleased that the 25 Member States of the European Union have at last adopted definitive anti-dumping measures in relation to the import of Chinese and Vietnamese shoes."
"European manufacturers were suffering heavy losses in their export market and were victims of unfair competition."
"It was therefore right to apply the trade defence instruments which the European Union has at its disposal, instruments that, I would remind you, were approved by the WTO."
"Furthermore, I wonder about Mr Mandelson's desire to fight against protectionism and about his assimilation of it, in the context of future reform - the Global Europe communication - with trade defence instruments."
"I am not in favour of protected markets, shielded from competition, disconnected from all the developments brought about by globalisation."
"Nonetheless I am in favour of applying the legal rules when, in the markets, the competition is unfair."
"Therefore, the safeguards or anti-dumping measures must under no circumstances be put in the same category as protectionist instruments."
"The purpose of these instruments is to protect European manufacturers against unfair competition, by requiring compliance with the rules defined by the WTO."
"I ask the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, therefore, what the aim of this reform will really be: to adapt these instruments or to weaken them?"
"European Agency for Reconstruction (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction - C6-0170/2006 -."
"Mr President, Honourable Members, I would like to thank Mr Kacin very much for the positive assessment of our proposal in his report."
"Let me first explain the rationale of the proposal."
"At the end of an era of reconstruction, and in view of the preparations for accession, we decided to reassess the mechanisms for assistance implementation in the Balkans, including the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"We explained our views on the future of the Agency in a report issued in December last year, which was transmitted to the Council and the European Parliament for information."
"The need to prepare the beneficiary countries to assume their own financial responsibility for the implementation of EU assistance led the Commission to the conclusion to discontinue the Agency but to seek its extension for two years until 31 December 2008, with its current mandate and status, and gradually to phase out its activities under CARDS."
"In the mean time, the Commission will prepare the programming and implementation of the instrument for Pre-Accession in a deconcentrated manner through our delegations in the countries concerned from next year onwards."
"So we have both phasing-out and phasing-in going on at the same time."
"The current Regulation expires on 31 December 2006, and, therefore, it is important that the amending regulation is adopted well before the end of the year in order to provide continuity in the implementation of CARDS and legal certainty for the staff of the Agency."
"A number of administrative decisions will have to be taken directly following the adoption of this regulation before the end of the year."
"On the phasing-out of the Agency, the Commission is committed to ensuring an efficient phasing-out and at the same time a phasing-in of the EU delegation's liaison office in order to deliver aid without disruption and in a cost-effective manner."
"This is a complex process in terms of transferring staff (to the extent possible), transferring files, closing all remaining financial activities and making all necessary arrangements to ensure sufficient premises for the reinforced Commission delegations."
"The Director-General of DG Enlargement has created a Task Force at director level to monitor and steer this process."
"The Commission welcomes Mr Kacin's proposal for regular reporting to the European Parliament 'on the ongoing operational details of the transfer plan'."
"My services will always be at your disposal to reply to your questions and to provide you with updated information on a regular basis."
"However, for the sake of legal clarity, I would prefer that this amendment is not included in the text of the amending regulation, the purpose of which is merely to extend the mandate of the Agency for an additional two years."
"As rapporteur for Serbia and rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for Albania, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I have been following the political circumstances in the region very closely."
"I am aware of the fact that the phasing out of the Agency will coincide with a period of critical developments in the Western Balkans."
"We have already witnessed Montenegro's declaration of independence, and now we are facing not only the prospect of local, parliamentary and presidential elections but also, on top of that, the constitutional referendum in Serbia."
"This will take place by the end of the year and, although in theory it should not affect the timetable for deciding the future status of Kosovo, it will nonetheless do so in practice."
"For this reason, I have also drafted two amendments that I will proceed to present."
"As I stated when presenting my report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I support the Commission's proposal for phasing out the Agency by extending its mandate for a further two years."
"The Agency will retain and renew its current status and mandate, together with its activities under the CARDS programme, but it will be phased out and replaced by Commission delegations and offices that will manage the IPA, our new financial instrument."
"The Agency was founded in 2000 as the principal EU office for reconstruction in war-ravaged Kosovo."
"It later extended its operations to Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The Agency is independent and its mandate is renewed successively every year by the Council and the European Parliament."
"Hence, even as far back as its founding, it operated on the premise that it was a temporary body and that it would ultimately be replaced."
"Now, ten years after the Kosovo crisis, it is obvious that the current interim arrangements are inadequate and inappropriate."
"The countries of the Western Balkans are in a state of transition from a reconstruction phase to a phase of preparation for their prospective membership of the European Union."
"Streamlining the European Union's activities by devolving them to Commission delegations is therefore the appropriate and correct way of demonstrating our political commitment to the countries of the Western Balkans."
"This will also ensure that we make the best use of EU taxpayers' money."
"Beginning to phase out the Agency now, at a time when activities under the CARDS programme are also being discontinued and replaced by the new financial instrument that is the IPA is both sensible and timely."
"I firmly believe that the new streamlined and rationalised arrangements for the political and financial assistance offered by the EU will have positive effects on the political and economic stability of the region."
"The draft amendment in my original proposal recommended that, in order to coordinate our positions with the Commission, we draw up a detailed report on our organisational plans for devolution."
"As the Commissioner has informed us, my later recommendation envisaged instead a draft amendment which would oblige the Commission to report to Parliament and the Council on the situation in this region on a quarterly basis."
"However, the devolution process must be continuous."
"The quarterly reports would need to include brief information on the progress of the devolution of individual duties from the Agency to the individual delegations, as well as an assessment of their cooperation in the quarterly period."
"The reports would need to include new facts that have been gathered since the last report or will shortly be gathered, and would also need to set new objectives that need to be met."
"Likewise, the reports would need to include an overview of devolution in practice in the beneficiary countries, particularly in the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is still a candidate country, but unfortunately at present still does not have a date for the commencement of negotiations."
"In the context of these reports, the Commission would also need to present measures which it intends to adopt in order to promote regional projects after the Agency ceases to operate."
"Equally, the Commission must adopt specific plans to expand the delegations in response to the break-up of the Republic of Serbia and Montenegro and to expand the delegations in the light of the future status of Kosovo when that becomes reality."
"At the same time, I have called on the Commission to ensure that all the valuable knowledge and technical expertise which the Agency has accumulated during the seven years of its operation is transferred to the delegations."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kacin, I should like to draw the Chamber's attention to the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"On at least two missions, one in Thessaloniki and the other in Kosovo, the committee has noted the effectiveness and innovation of the European Reconstruction Agency's external activities."
"No such previous Community action has been anything like as effective or innovative."
"Action on the ground, in conjunction with the local authorities, has been outstandingly good, and I feel it would be a serious mistake if we were to fail to make use of such action in other situations and to forego its benefits."
"Commission resources and European funds must not merely be handed over to the United Nations or to NGOs or to any other institution without the proper resources to administer Community funds on the ground."
"The EAR's experience in administering Community funds has been most valuable, and I should like to call on the Commission not to let that experience go to waste, because that would be disastrous for the whole of the EU."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, for his work."
"Although we do not always agree about matters of substance, working with him and discussing things with him are always interesting experiences."
"I might add that I fully agree with his amendments."
"As Mr Casaca has already said, the Agency has done a very good job, and I think that the EU can be proud of itself for creating it."
"It has indeed done an excellent job, and if that is said by someone like Mr Casaca of the Committee on Budgetary Control, a body from which we can of course expect particular criticism, it counts even more."
"Nevertheless, I agree with Commissioner Rehn when he says that times and situations change; individual countries go their separate ways; the duration of the run-up to countries' accessions often varies."
"I would also ask him, however, to ensure that the people who have had some very positive experiences in these countries also be given the opportunity to continue to do good work for the EU and for these countries."
"I should like to take this opportunity to give my sincere thanks to Commissioner Rehn, too, for his commitment to this region; as it is very important to have someone with sensitivity towards the region, someone who knows that its needs have to be met appropriately, and that that includes a pan-European approach."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner to do his utmost in the coming months, at a time when the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo will be precarious, and also to join together with Parliament - and the Council, too, I hope - to guarantee the stability of this region. I am sure that he will do so."
"A great deal of the work that the Agency, too, has done, will simply be undone if we do not set clear European objectives to ensure that the path towards EU membership is clear."
"The countries must increasingly do their own work, however - albeit with our help and support - as we cannot take it off them."
"It is very important, therefore, that the responsible Commissioner give a clear direction."
"If he does so, we shall give him our full support in his further work."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, the accession of newcomers to the European Union is at its most successful when they already enjoy more or less the same level of democracy, human rights, environmental protection and welfare as do the other Member States."
"The European Agency for Reconstruction can help remove some of the differences that are still delaying the accession of seven western Balkan states."
"In recent years, there were differences of opinion about the emphasis this agency should place on education and infrastructure, of both of which there is a desperate lack in those countries, or on reforms."
"Those reforms in the areas of governance, justice, police and market are mainly external requests."
"Internal requests, on the other hand, are requests for financial support for small projects that can be tackled independently without too much red tape, supervision or control, combined with the restoration of railway lines, bridges, flood-control dams and drinking water basins that have suffered damage as a result of war or neglect."
"To pass on the responsibilities of this agency to delegations and agencies of the Commission in 2009 is a radical step."
"What I would like the Commission to tell us is whether it only wants to help simplify EU intervention or also wants to meet local needs more effectively"
"(EL) Mr President, I too agree with the previous speakers who said that the Balkan reconstruction agency did indeed play a very important role, not only initially in sending humanitarian aid, but primarily in the reconstruction and strengthening of democratic reforms and in consolidating democratic institutions in the countries of the Western Balkans."
"This role was strengthened in particular - or I would say legalised - by the decisions taken by the European Council in Thessaloniki in June 2003 to support the European prospects of the Balkans, which support we need to constantly renew with deeds and decisions."
"Of course, this role became more effective because Thessaloniki was chosen as the agency's headquarters, due to its geographical vicinity and its knowledge of this area."
"As we have seen, the agency was created in a difficult period for the Balkans."
"I fear that this is an equally difficult period today; we are at a dead end in the negotiations on Kosovo and therefore - and I appeal here to Commissioner Rehn - particular care is needed and we need to pass new competences to the local representations of the Commission in the capitals of the Western Balkans at once, so that there is no vacuum."
"Of course, there is the two-year transitional period, but what we need to secure as of now is for experience and know-how to be passed on from the agency to the local representations of the Commission."
"I would even say, Commissioner, that you need to be flexible, that you should not be dogmatic, even when it comes to the possibility of negative developments in the Balkans, so that provision is made right now to extend the term of office of the agency in Thessaloniki a little, even to beyond December 2008, depending on local developments."
"To close, I would say that the reconstruction process in the Balkans is not a technocratic process."
"It is, of course, a political process, which is why the European Commission should keep the European Parliament informed. I agree with Mr Kacin that periodic reports should be submitted on the operation of local ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, the Commission proposes to discontinue the European Agency for Reconstruction, but also to extend it for two years until 31 December 2008, retaining its status and mandate."
"According to this plan, the Agency and its activities will be gradually phased out and replaced by Commission representations and offices which will be managed by a new financial instrument."
"Reform and ensuring proper financial management is of key importance to the European Union."
"On the other hand, the phasing out of the European Agency for Reconstruction should not follow a rigid schedule, but should be based on political and economic criteria and factors with full use of its potential as regards specialist knowledge and practice."
"The European Agency for Reconstruction is being closed at a time of key political events concerning the development of the Western Balkans."
"In eliminating the Agency, the Commission must make provision for securing stability in the region, and for the UN Security Council decision on the status of Kosovo."
"Securing the role of the European Union in this process should be a primary aim in this."
"- (LT) While working at the European Parliament, I had the opportunity to visit countries of the former Yugoslavia as well as Albania and witness at first hand how valuable the European perspective is for those countries."
"The European Agency for Reconstruction has played and continues to play an important role in stabilising the situation and supporting reforms in the region."
"As we gradually phase out the activities of the Agency, the economic and political consequences of the elimination of the Agency and the use of the professional experience and knowledge of its staff must be considered."
"The next few years will be crucial for the West Balkan states on their way to the EU, while some ways of solving the Kosovo problem can once again disrupt not only this region, but much more."
"I welcome suggestions of how to strengthen Parliamentary control at this stage of the Agency's operation."
"The Commission's report should explain whether the delegations and officers of the Commission taking over the task of closing the Agency will be able to properly compensate for this closure."
"Member of the Commission."
"(SV) Mr President, honourable Members, I would thank Parliament for supporting the Commission's decision gradually to phase out the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) by allowing the Agency to discontinue its activities under the CARDS Programme."
"As the IPA is phased in, we shall obtain the best possible conditions for successfully continuing to support affected countries in the Western Balkans."
"Many Members have expressed concern about the EU losing expert knowledge."
"We are keen to retain the expertise we have and are therefore, as far as possible, inviting those staff who now work for the EAR to do the same type of work in the Commission's delegations."
"Where Montenegro and Kosovo are concerned, the Commission is in the process of planning a well-structured delegation in Podgorica, Montenegro and a possible upgrading of our liaison office in Priština."
"Mr President, I would thank Parliament for its support for our stabilisation and integration policy in the Western Balkans."
"It is incredibly important that we work together in pursuit of the same goals."
"I am sure that, together, we can achieve very good results when it comes to stabilising the Western Balkans and integrating them into the European Union."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner and all the speakers in that debate."
"I should also like to thank the interpreters for their patience."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.05 p.m.)"
"One-minute speeches (Rule 144)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(PL) Mr President, for a number of months now, Polish farmers and exporters of farm produce have been unable to export their products to the Russian Federation."
"In March this year Ukraine became the latest country to ban the import of meat and meat products from Poland."
"The decision was taken without giving any legal grounds for it."
"It is surprising that talks between the European Union and the Russian Federation have yielded no results."
"Perhaps the European Commission does not attach the required importance to matters of trade between Poland and Russia, and gives priority to other interests of the European Union and other countries."
"For this reason, I again ask the European Commission to do everything it can to have the export ban on Polish agricultural products in Ukraine and Russia lifted."
"This is a problem that is within the competence of the European Commission, and also within the scope of its responsibility."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago an Internet website linked to Al Qaeda declared a holy war through the Internet, inviting all the Muslim hackers of the world to bombard Christian websites, especially the Pope's."
"This is, in my opinion, an extremely serious matter and an attack on the fundamental principle of religious freedom."
"When the freedom to be able to address the world by means of communication is under attack, especially at the highest level, and aim is taken at a religion, indeed at an entire system of belief, one of the basic values of the European Union is under attack: the principle of religious freedom."
"Europe cannot remain silent about this."
"We are faced with an escalation of actions and initiatives whose purpose is to strike at the basic principles of our freedom."
"We must defend ourselves from such arrogance and from such a totalitarian escalation of Islamic fundamentalist extremism."
"(HU) I feel that as a Hungarian MEP, I ought to respond to the sudden international interest in my homeland."
"It is my conviction that there is unnecessarily great concern in the European Parliament with internal political struggles, and my Hungarian colleagues in the opposition have brought an atmosphere of Cold War politics into the building."
"We did not receive our mandate in order to bring the conflicts among our domestic parties onto a European political stage, as this serves only to increase the distance between the European institutions and the citizens of the European Union."
"It cannot be in anyone's interest to present a biased image of Hungary and to destroy the positive image of the country that we have worked so hard to build up."
"If we want the decreasing confidence in the EU and its institutions to be restored, we must transcend petty conflicts of interest and engage in European-style politics to meet the not insignificant challenges that face us."
"The further enlargement of the Union, offences against human rights, the negative effects of globalisation and the efficient collection and expenditure of EU funds for the development of neglected regions are but a few of these."
"We have a lot to do."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, less than twenty-four hours ago I was in Moscow and, for one moment, was on the point of putting on the MEP's sash while I was among the thousands of people paying their last respects to Anna Politkovskaya."
"Then I thought that that would offend the gaze of that lady, even though she could not see me, to see our emblem on display."
"The journalist Anna Politkovskaya told us what you did not wish to see or hear."
"On page 6 of today's Le Monde we read about people arrested in Moscow because they said: 'Georgians, we are on your side!'."
"Georgians, not Chechens."
"The symbols worn by those who were arrested were, moreover, those of the Transnational Radical Party."
"We, as radicals and liberals, have brought to this Parliament members of the Chechen Government in exile, who came to announce that they had chosen non-violence."
"Nothing was done about it."
"Mr President, allow me to make a suggestion: let us no longer call our buildings 'Schuman' or 'Adenauer'; let us call them 'Daladier' and 'Ollenhauer'."
"Let us remove these names that we have no right to use ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the poisoning scandal involving the Probo Koala in Ivory Coast a few weeks ago, the repercussions of which are as yet incalculable."
"The ship has, or will soon have, permission to leave Estonia."
"There is still much uncertainty as to what will happen with the poison and the contaminated crew."
"My observer, who travelled to Estonia on my behalf, totally agrees with Commissioner Dimas when he says that this is only the tip of the iceberg."
"Poison of that kind should never have left the EU in the first place."
"This is a breach of European and international law."
"Having been denied the opportunity to speak with the crew of the Probo Koala on several occasions, despite prior permission, I can only conclude that various authorities are playing a very underhand game with human lives, a game that is not yet over by a long way."
"The Probo Emoe is already appearing over the horizon."
"(HU) As I mentioned at the meeting last week of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the greatest and most tangible achievement of the rule of law is precisely citizens' free exercise of political rights."
"These, of course, are not to be confused with inadmissible violent acts."
"For this reason, I wish to draw Parliament's attention to the investigations and the offences requiring investigation which took place in Budapest on the night of 19-20 September, the consequences of which are still being felt to this day, calling into question the effectiveness of the rule of law in Hungary."
"According to complaints, the police used excessive force on the two days in question, and took disproportionately harsh measures not only against the demonstrators but against young people, including several foreign nationals, who were on the streets."
"Among those they arrested, punished collectively and in some cases still continue to detain were some individuals who had absolutely nothing to do with the violent events."
"It is important that the use of force to curtail fundamental human rights and in particular personal freedom - such as preliminary arrest and detention - should be used only in cases where they are absolutely convinced that this is truly necessary."
"(HU) Mr President, the European spirit is under threat in Hungary; we are moving further away from Europe."
"The socialist Minister of Local Government and Regional Development made a promise to his fellow coalition members last Saturday that he would make the appropriate legislative amendments to ensure that, in future, development funds from the European Union are distributed based on party political considerations."
"If this becomes a reality, it would no longer be elected bodies that decide on the use of funds from the EU budget, but rather party political intentions would set the course, thus providing fertile ground for non-transparent, unverifiable spending."
"This declaration not only endangers Hungary's credibility in the European Union, but also the development of a European spirit in Hungary, which demands that EU funds should serve cohesion and unity among the Hungarian people, based on the realisation of the fundamental principles of democracy."
"The remarks by the socialist minister unambiguously point to the fact that the use of EU funds serves the aim of enriching the Hungarian socialist party elite."
"Mr President, last Friday the Hungarian Government gained a solid majority in a vote of confidence in the Hungarian Parliament."
"As a result, our national currency has become stronger, economic prospects are better and Hungary has returned to normal life."
"There is no general crisis in Budapest."
"Only our leading opposition party, Fidesz, is in crisis."
"The elected members of the national parliament lead anti-democratic demonstrations on the streets instead of opposing the government inside the parliament."
"As far as I know, elected parliamentarians should work in the parliament, not on the street, where extreme-right wrongdoers who were also demonstrating set fire to a building housing a television station."
"It would be very wise if the PPE-DE Group could tell its Hungarian members that parliamentary democracy should mean respect for parliament, respect for parliamentary elections and strict borderlines between democratic politics and non-parliamentary extremism."
"Mr President, a report recently issued by the United Nations Human Rights Office for Iraq states that the bodies at the Baghdad mortuary often bear signs of horrific torture, including acid burns, excision of eyes and teeth and wounds made by drills and nails."
"Human rights organisations have repeatedly reported that acts of torture are taking place in the prisons run by the US and British forces and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and Defence and in prisons controlled by various military factions."
"The UN Human Rights Office's position is that the level of torture in Iraq today is worse than it was during Saddam Hussein's rule of terror."
"The EU, and Parliament in particular, have an obligation to respond appropriately to this UN report."
"I call upon you, as well as the President of the Commission and the Finnish Presidency, to make a clear statement on the issue as soon as possible."
"(PL) Mr President, at last year's confidential session of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on a new partnership agreement with Russia, the PCA, Mr Brok, the chairman of the committee, acted in a scandalous way."
"Mr Brok reacted brusquely to my question to Mr Mingarelli, whose job was to reassure the new Member States that the planned agreement with Russia would not affect their energy security, and that the agreement would not be concluded in the manner of the agreement on building the northern pipeline, in other words that it would not protect exclusively German interests."
"In a raised voice he replied that it was the kind of question that might be raised at an election rally in his country and rejected it without giving the speaker a chance to reply."
"Leaving aside the fact that the reaction itself was quite arrogant and supercilious, Mr Brok allowed the principles of parliamentary democracy, which is based on pluralism of views and freedom of expression by MEPs, to be violated."
"His behaviour showed extreme bias in the running of the committee towards securing the sanctity of German-Russian relations."
"I ask the President to respond to this and to explain the behaviour of Mr Brok in his discrimination against MEPs from the new Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, one event chases away another."
"Nonetheless we are now witnessing live the escalation of violations of the rules of international law perpetrated by Russia against Georgia: the granting of Russian citizenship to the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the rejection of the peace plan proposed by Georgia to settle the conflicts with the separatist regions and the closure of the two border crossing points."
"Tension has further increased following the arrest of Russian spies by Georgia, with reprisals from Moscow which has hunted down Georgians and is trying to economically strangle its neighbour by unilaterally introducing sanctions blocking trade between Russia and Georgia."
"Finally, by giving the impression that Russia would recognise the separatist regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, if Kosovo gained its independence, Mr Putin makes the resolution of the conflict even more remote."
"The list is long and the Georgians are utterly exasperated."
"Faced with this situation on the brink of explosion, the European Union has a crucial role to play in bringing the sides, and especially Russia on the occasion of European Union/Russia negotiations, to the negotiating table to find a solution and put an end to this latent conflict in the Southern Caucasus."
"The Neighbourhood Policy allows us this; military action would be a total failure of our policies."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 10 billion is the sum that the Italian Government has concealed and written off from its debts in presenting the national budget for 2007."
"I thank you warmly for having given me the floor to make it known, through this Parliament, especially to the Commission, that the budget that has reached you from the Italian Government lacks a debit entry of EUR 10 billion."
"To whom is this debit owed?"
"To the Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland and are awaiting this payment of EUR 10 billion, which the Italian Government has no intention of paying and - what is worse - which they have deleted from the budget."
"No one knows that there is a debit item of EUR 10 billion in the Italian national budget."
"I hope that, from today, it will be known to everyone."
"(ET) Mr President, last Saturday, Russia was once again the scene of a political murder."
"The first few years of the 21st century have clearly demonstrated that in Russia the right to express the truth is a taboo for which people must all too often pay the ultimate price - their lives."
"Political foul play has become a part of everyday life in Russia, and unfortunately we too must come to terms with this."
"Anna Politkovskaya's struggle for democracy, human rights and freedom of expression is the best thing that could have been done in the interests of tomorrow's Russia and a better Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely believe and hope that Parliament and the unofficial meeting of the Heads of State or Government at the informal dinner to be held in Lahti on 20 October will be able to exert sufficient pressure on President Putin to ensure that the truth of this terrible injustice is revealed as soon as possible, and that all those who participated in it are brought to justice."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of water shortages, which is becoming an important matter for many citizens of Europe."
"Water is necessary for life and for economic activity."
"Unfortunately, the constant increase in temperatures in the 25 Member States (by 0.2oC over 10 years) and a reduction in precipitation in many regions have made access to water increasingly difficult for many citizens, leading to losses in agriculture and problems in manufacturing."
"The water situation is rapidly deteriorating, while investments in renewing water resources and water conservation are a long-term, costly process."
"This makes it necessary to organise training and the exchange of experience, and to popularise best practice and methods for the rational use of water and water conservation."
"Economic activities should also be redirected towards rationalising the water situation in all areas of the economy."
"Water shortages could become a barrier to agricultural production, and in particular to the production of raw materials for biofuels, whose supply is not a problem."
"The water situation must be constantly monitored, and Parliament needs to be kept regularly informed ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"- (LT) While travelling to the Women's Basketball World Championships, the Lithuanian basketball players ended up stuck in French Guiana on their way to Brazil and were unable to depart for four days."
"Brazil refused to admit anyone who was not vaccinated against yellow fever."
"After subsequent vaccination and the verbal assurances of the Minister of Health of Brazil that everything would be all right, the Lithuanian team finally reached Belen in Brazil by chartered aeroplane."
"However, they were rudely forced back onto the plane by immigration officers and sent back to Cayenne."
"Only the Lithuanian basketball players received such treatment."
"Other Europeans who were vaccinated at the same time were admitted to Belen."
"Brazilian officers made it clear that German players would face no problems in this situation."
"Why is Lithuania subject to double standards, as if it were not a European Union Member State?"
"It would appear necessary to allocate more funding for raising awareness about the new EU countries, not only within the EU, but also abroad."
"- (LT) Can a mouse really scare an elephant?"
"It would appear so, and the current crisis in relations between Russia and Georgia is evidence of this."
"The European Union has a choice of how to react to events in its neighbourhood: it can just make a statement or get actively involved in the peaceful settlement of this conflict."
"I welcome the participation of Mr De Gucht, the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in handing over the Russian officers to Russia and his statement made on behalf of the EU."
"However, this is still not enough."
"I believe that, if Russia is considering the possibility of military action in resolving the conflict with Georgia, the European Union must make every effort to immediately stop the deportation of Georgians from Russia and the compiling of lists of pupils from Moscow schools with Georgian family names, as this reminds us of the policy of Nazi Germany and the deportation of citizens of Jewish nationality."
"During the deportations following the Soviet occupation, my parents were transported to Siberia in wagons for animals."
"Now the means of transport have changed: Georgians are deported from Moscow in planes used for the transport of cargo."
"Such acts and such a policy cannot be allowed to continue."
"(PL) Mr President, in May this year we adopted at second reading the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods, which states that as of 1 January 2007 European law will make food producers responsible for placing accurate information regarding the properties of food products on packaging."
"This means in practice that all the health benefits of products must be confirmed by independent laboratories."
"Unfortunately these regulations will only superficially benefit consumers."
"Also, the EU regulation may eliminate the products of small and medium-sized companies who will be unable to afford tests of the same standard as wealthy European firms."
"In effect, consumers will have less and less choice and will be unable to make informed purchases, and they will still not know what they are actually buying."
"The destructive mechanism of such competition could be restricted by licensing the right to issue recommendatory health symbols, and creating a uniform system of recognising healthy products."
"It is also essential to give special support to small and medium-sized enterprises, whose products are often of higher quality than the products of large companies on our common market."
"(PL) Mr President, the Republic of Lithuania gained independence just over a decade ago."
"This fact was celebrated by all of democratic Europe."
"Lithuania immediately started to introduce social and economic reforms, the aim of which was to eliminate the remains of Soviet occupation."
"An important role in achieving independence was played by the large Polish minority (10% of the total population), which has for centuries inhabited the areas around the capital Vilnius."
"However, although many years have gone by since the end of Soviet rule, the Lithuanian authorities have so far failed to return to the Poles the land that was confiscated from them by the occupying forces. And despite numerous agreements, Lithuania has refused to allow Polish names to be written in their Polish spelling, insisting that they be written in Lithuanian."
"These activities are a blatant breach of European regulations on national and ethnic minorities in EU Member States."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to draw the Chamber's attention to a serious problem facing the Czech Republic as regards drawing on cohesion funds for modernising the waste-water sector."
"In order for us to honour our obligations under the directive on waste-water treatment, we will have to invest over EUR 4 million by 2010, more than 10% of our annual national budget."
"We agree, of course, that this cannot be done without EU subsidies."
"I therefore fail to understand how it is possible that in the Commission there are projects aimed at bringing clean water to Czech towns that have been lying untouched for a year and a half."
"These are projects put forward by our water companies based on an operational model that is in line with Community law, and yet Commission officials, acting on the basis of personal whim, refuse to authorise them and try instead to dictate to us, the elected representatives of these towns, what sort of contracts we should be signing and how we should be solving the problems of the water sector."
"Let us not forget that the Czech Republic is in the heart of Europe and that the main European rivers rise there and flow into neighbouring countries."
"This is therefore not only a Czech problem, but also a European one."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have emphasised the untimeliness of the statement by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, before the vote in Parliament on the Eurlings report on Turkey, since Mr Barroso influenced the vote with his negative observations, aimed at ruling out Turkey's prospects of membership."
"Furthermore, given the subsequent comments by Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen, one must think that Mr Barroso was lacking in foresight concerning not only our Parliament but also the Commission itself."
"I wish to express my full support for Mr Verheugen's statement, which confirmed the objective of full membership of the European Union for Turkey and emphasised that it is in our interests to have a Turkey that is linked to the West: that is, a democratic Turkey governed by the rule of law, which respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities."
"This, in my opinion, is the objective that we must keep in view: a European Union that is capable of promoting democracy and the rule of law and - please allow me to say this, Mr President - a European Union that should have had the courage to send representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to the funeral of Anna Politkovskaya, something that, in the event, it did not do."
". - (SV) Mr President, you recently contended that the historic dimension possessed by the EU seat in Strasbourg cannot be viewed in the same way by certain Nordic countries that did not participate in the Second World War."
"The people of the Nordic region did not suffer enough during the Second World War to be able to understand the symbolic value of having the European Parliament in Strasbourg."
"Thus, Nordic criticism of the European Parliament's expensive commute to Strasbourg can be dismissed."
"Your statement was, of course, entirely erroneous from an historical point of view - Finland, Norway and Denmark were, in fact, involved in the Second World War - but it is also remarkable in another respect, in that the President of the European Parliament is entirely serious in believing that we should not listen to views on the sites at which the European Parliament sits if such views are expressed by citizens and MEPs from countries that did not take part in the Second World War."
"This is a grotesque idea, the only redeeming feature of which is that we thus need not listen to the President either, as Spain was also a non-combatant country in the Second World War."
"This line of thought is unreasonable."
"The peoples of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden today have as much right to be heard in the current debate as those of other countries."
"It is scandalous that the person entrusted to be the President of the European Parliament should have such poor judgment as to consider himself entitled to tell us whom we should listen to and whom we should try to silence."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Lundgren."
"I wonder whether you have had time to read the letter that I wrote in response to the letter sent to me by several Members, and which you will have received."
"Have you read it?"
"If you have, I do not understand your question."
"You are still saying things that are entirely false."
"In that letter I explained to everybody what I said."
"What I said is nothing like what you claim I have said."
"In that letter, I explain clearly that I merely pointed out that some countries may be influenced in their points of view by the fact that, during their history, they did not take part in the world war."
"That is in no way intended to imply that some countries have no right to express an opinion."
"It does not mean that their opinion should not be heard."
"I simply say that they have different opinions and that one of the reasons for that may be that they have different histories."
"Why do you say that the President of Parliament is denying anybody the right to express an opinion?"
"Do you imagine that I am stupid enough to deny any European citizen the right to express an opinion because of their country's history?"
"Of course everybody has the right to express their opinion."
"I simply say that opinions may vary for differing historical reasons."
"Quite frankly, I do not understand why we are having such an absurd debate about a misinterpretation of my words that you, I regret to say, are persisting with."
"(HU) It is unfortunate that the question of the conflict between Georgia and Russia, and a debate on these unusually disturbing tensions is not on the agenda."
"This would be a very opportune time for such a discussion."
"Things are happening in the Caucasus that may seem astonishing at first glance, but in reality are the natural consequences of a decade and a half of Russian-Georgian relations."
"The retaliation and punishment following the discovery of a group of Russian spies reflect a warlike situation."
"It is unacceptable that the Russians should expel Georgian citizens from the country on the basis of their ethnic identity."
"We are faced with a violation of human and civil rights and freedoms."
"It is obvious that the Russian Federation cannot accept that it has lost its influence over the Georgian Republic."
"It finds this hard to bear, as it feels its identity as a great power threatened."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament have a great responsibility."
"They need to intervene more decisively and negotiate with the Russians."
"First of all, we need to establish what the territorial integrity of Georgia means, for at present this is understood in several different ways."
"It is only through peaceful means that a solution can be found, and we must avoid the outbreak of another armed conflict in the region."
"Mr President, I wish to raise the European perspective of the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair."
"Until recently, Aer Lingus was the Irish national carrier and in state ownership."
"It was in a healthy economic situation but needed to raise finance to renew its fleet."
"The Irish Government said that the EU would not permit any state investment in the airline, which is news to me."
"As I understand it, a state has flexibility in investing in airlines if in fact they are in a healthy economic position - as indeed Aer Lingus was."
"This is another example of the 'blame Brussels' mentality, whereby a national government can explain its own actions by saying, 'the EU will not allow that', when that is not necessarily the case."
"However, that is history, and we now have Aer Lingus being targeted in a takeover bid by its main rival, Ryanair."
"In a way it is ironic that on the one hand we blame the EU for the current situation when in fact no blame attaches, while on the other hand we will undoubtedly make a case to the Commission's DG Competition to block the takeover, to save us from our own actions and to protect us from the consequences of those actions."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to salute Portuguese workers and their union confederation, the CGT-IN, who will be holding a general day of protest tomorrow, 12 October, against the right-wing policies pursued in Portugal."
"Among other issues, the Portuguese workers are fighting against the government's social security proposals aimed at raising the retirement age and at reducing pensions; they are fighting to protect and increase domestic manufacturing, to create jobs with associated rights, to defend public services and public administration designed to serve the citizens; and they are fighting for the right to collective contracts, for higher wages and for the fair distribution of wealth."
"I wish to say a final word, Mr President, on the European Court of Justice's recent ruling on the Cadman case regarding maternity/paternity leave and salary calculations. In my view, it is utterly unacceptable that this could be seen as, and used for the purpose of, bringing into question the principle of 'equal pay for equal work', which is enshrined in Article 59 of the Constitution of the Republic of Portugal."
"- (SK) Last June the European Commission developed a proposal envisaging a reduction in land areas taken up by vineyards in the European Union."
"The losses and consequences resulting from this reduction would be offset through a package of direct agricultural payments totalling EUR 2.4 billion."
"This proposal would affect nearly 12% of the total surface area of vineyards, in other words approximately 4 000 hectares tended by about one and a half million viticulturists."
"This step could entirely undermine wine production in Slovakia, which has experienced substantial growth over the past few years, especially in terms of wine quality; in addition, this comes at a time when Slovak wines are becoming increasingly competitive in European Union markets."
"The Commission's proposal also prohibits the use of added sugar in producing certain types of wine, although in my country this procedure is traditional, as the vines cultivated in Slovakia are characterised by higher acidity, which is typical for the region."
"I am not questioning the need for reform in the European wine market, but I believe we should look to other solutions."
"Mr President, next week a LIBE Committee delegation will visit Algeria."
"However, one of the Algerian visa requirements is the absence of an Israeli visa passport stamp."
"Mr Gaubert noticed this and was rightly appalled at this blatant anti-Semitism."
"He demanded an explanation."
"The matter was referred to you, Mr President, and you were asked to make representations to the Algerians."
"I understand that you refused to do so, saying it was a matter for individual MEPs."
"Mr Gaubert has quite rightly refused to go on the trip."
"This raises two important issues."
"First, why has the European Union sent almost one billion euro to Algeria since 1996, when that country is implementing a blatantly anti-Semitic policy?"
"The EU should stop these payments immediately."
"The second issue is the apparent dereliction of duty by you, Mr President, when you could have made a stand against Algeria's anti-Semitism, backed by the weight of your office."
"Please reconsider and rectify this situation."
"The truth is that I do not know what you are referring to, Mr Batten, but you are welcome to clarify what you have said to me."
"If you would be kind enough to give me the details, I will be able to ascertain whether or not I have acted correctly and, if necessary, I will put things right."
"I am happy for you to explain your point further."
"(PL) Mr President, today's debate about the soft fruit sector gives rise to the hope that the two years of attempts to change the organisation of the fruit and vegetable market are now beginning to take effect."
"Is it not strange that the Member State that supplies 90% of the EU's frozen strawberries had to wait so long for a decision to introduce protective customs tariffs?"
"Many Polish farmers have incurred huge losses in the past few years while waiting for an end to Chinese dumping on the market."
"Nobody will compensate them for these losses."
"But the fruit and vegetable market is not confined just to strawberries."
"The 18 main produce types introduced by the new Member States are an issue that has still not been regulated."
"These include above all cooking apples."
"Polish apple growers will soon be protesting against the low prices offered by the processing industry."
"Parliament has spent two years attempting to regulate this sector of the fruit and vegetable market, so far to no avail."
"Suffice it to say that apples are the main fruit in the European Union as regards harvesting (they account for 32% of all fruit harvested), while the EU is also a major importer of this fruit."
"How much longer will we have to wait for this and other segments of the fruit and vegetable market to be regulated as promised in the European Parliament's resolution on simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables of 11 May 2005?"
"Will this vote be honoured by the European Commission?"
"A member of the secretariat will speak to Mr Batten so that he can explain the point he has made with regard to relations with Algeria and the President's compliance with his duties."
"That concludes this item."
"The protection and welfare of animals 2006-2010 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the protection and welfare of animals in the period 2006 to 2010."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January 2006, the Commission presented its Communication on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010."
"The report I drew up on this Communication as rapporteur for this House was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 September."
"The objective of the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals is to bring together Community activities previously spread across different Commission services, councils and policy areas and to structure them in accordance with uniform guidelines."
"Animal protection is an emotional, extremely politically sensitive issue."
"Such protection - appropriate to the specific needs and requirements of the respective animals - should be a matter of course in our civil society."
"On this basis, it is important to me as rapporteur that we establish a uniform level of animal protection in the EU."
"The Commission has emphasised time and again that the EU's animal-protection standards, which are already high and are set to be improved still further, are an example to the world."
"A large majority in the committee supported my emphasis on the need for precise impact assessments in the case of all legislative measures on animal protection."
"In addition, it is only consistent to demand these high animal-protection standards in negotiations with the WTO and in bilateral agreements."
"Genuine animal protection cannot be restricted to farmed animals and animals used in experiments, but must cover all animals."
"In addition, the progress that has been made must be taken into account."
"Many of my fellow Members, and many people who have written to me, are particularly concerned about animals used in experiments."
"The scientific research sector has significantly stepped up its efforts to protect animals in recent years, however."
"A large number of alternatives to animal testing have been developed in order to translate the 3Rs principle into practice."
"Even though there is still a long way to go on this, I do think that we are moving in the right direction."
"The report supports endeavours to replace animal testing with alternative methods on the basis of further research."
"For this reason, we are making consistent calls for resources to be made available under the Seventh Research Framework Programme, too."
"Precise scientifically based animal-protection indicators are the most reliable basis for the further development of viable animal protection."
"This baseline report for the 2006-2010 period is not intended to detail any specific individual measures."
"We do not support any amendments calling for the non-binding application of voluntary animal-protection standards at national level."
"The report makes an emphatic call for proper application and enforcement of the existing rules on animal protection, for example in the field of animal transport."
"We welcome the proposed ban on imports of cat and dog fur and call for decisive action to restrict the trade in seal products."
"The need for accession countries to adapt their legislation as a matter of urgency has been emphasised."
"In addition, we strongly support a simple, compulsory 'EU label' for animal protection."
"There are 14 amendments. We support Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 14 but cannot support Amendments 1, 9, 10 or 13."
"We have requested split voting on paragraphs 5, 7a, 29, 54 and 71."
"To the Commissioner I would say that Commissioner Kyprianou is currently in Brazil, where I am sure he will praise European animal-protection standards."
"I hope that he will also speak about the deficiencies in agricultural products imported into the EU from Brazil that have been detected once again by the EU Food and Veterinary Office."
"European agriculture and European consumers suffer as a result of distortions of competition."
"The European animal protection standards that are being called for must also have a positive impact on our competitiveness."
"I am much obliged to the Commissioner, and I am obliged to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation."
"Mr President, with regard to the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, I am grateful for all the hard work done by the members of the committees concerned."
"Let me acknowledge in particular the efforts of Mrs Jeggle on this important initiative."
"Animal welfare is a subject of major concern for EU citizens, stakeholders and Members of Parliament."
"They have all been very vocal in calling for higher standards of protection for animals, not just in the EU but worldwide."
"The Commission is working hard and with some success to develop a greater international consensus on animal welfare."
"For instance, we have been instrumental in the development of animal welfare standards by the World Organisation for Animal Health."
"We should remember that the issue is not restricted to farm animals, but also extends to experimental, zoo, circus and wild animals."
"The action plan seeks to promote a broad-based approach to animal welfare involving all stakeholders, so that everyone plays their part."
"It is not just a matter for farmers or animal handlers: scientists, industry, citizens and governments all have a role to play."
"Moreover, it is an area which can render sectors of the EU economy more competitive, and the proposed establishment of a European information platform would facilitate an open dialogue and a sharing of expertise and experience."
"There are also strong links with other Community policies, for example the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, the principle of better regulation and paying proper attention to the scientific, social and economic principles underpinning Community policies."
"As highlighted in Parliament's report and in the Austrian Presidency's conclusions, more research is needed to address current knowledge gaps and strengthen the scientific basis for our policies."
"In particular, the development and validation of objective science-based animal welfare indicators are key to the successful implementation of the action plan."
"This work could be improved by the establishment of a Community centre for the protection and welfare of animals."
"The Commission needs and intends to consult widely during the coming months, including with Member States and stakeholders, on the expectations for such a centre."
"In implementing the action plan, the Commission is keen to ensure that policies are developed and implemented in a more coherent and consistent manner, respecting our clear obligations under the protocol to the EC Treaty."
"Animal welfare is an issue of major importance for EU citizens and I very much welcome Parliament's positive attitude towards our initiative."
"The Commission will pay close attention to the aspects highlighted in Parliament's report, and I am sure we will return to the action plan many times during the course of its implementation."
"I look forward to Parliament's future support for the initiatives necessary to follow the strategy laid out in the plan."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every day, millions of animals suffer, be it in the meat industry's animal factories, in European slaughterhouses or in the course of transport or painful animal experiments."
"We now have the opportunity to make practical improvements to the conditions experienced by these animals."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"It was my predecessor, Mr Sjöstedt, who was responsible for the matter with which we are dealing."
"In the opinion we have drafted, we demand, for example, that animals should have the right to natural behaviour, that the overproduction of meat should be prevented, that all hens should be entitled to range freely by 2016 at the latest, that sows should have the right to roam freely throughout their life cycle and that a maximum time limit of eight hours should be introduced for the transport of animals."
"Therefore, it is, unfortunately, with disappointment that I am forced to note that Mrs Jeggle's report does not pay heed to any of these demands."
"It is thus important for us to influence this report as much as possible."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has requested a split vote on those points we think make the value of animals dependent on commercial considerations."
"If Mrs Jeggle's report is adopted, animal protection will only become something worth aiming for if it is not in conflict with the WTO and commercial interests."
"That is how matters actually stand, but we cannot have them remain like that."
"Animals have value irrespective of changes in competitiveness."
"What is important is that we in Europe take the initiative and become competitive through higher standards and better animal protection."
"I would therefore call on you to vote down the wordings in recital G and in paragraphs 51, 52, 53 and 59."
"I would also call on you to vote in favour of, for example, Amendments 11 and 12, now happily also supported by Mrs Jeggle."
"If you vote in this way, we can finally obtain an action plan that makes life much better for the hundreds of millions of animals in the EU."
"That is something that animals deserve."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for this sound, objective, professional report."
"It is well known that Austria, my home country, has a national animal protection act that is among the most modern in Europe."
"I am delighted that this report has borrowed heavily from the Austrian Federal Act on the Protection of Animals, which is really very practicable and is concerned with keeping animals in conditions appropriate to the respective species."
"This whole matter has been very difficult, as the European public is rightly concerned about this issue."
"After all, the welfare of all animals must be taken into account."
"For this reason, I am very disappointed that the previous speaker still refers only to animals for breeding and production, not to all animals."
"All animals are living beings, and all have a right to be kept in conditions appropriate to their species, be it in zoos or homes or as pets."
"Being a farmer who ran a farm for more than 30 years and kept animals there, I of all people know how important it is that animals be kept in conditions appropriate to their species. The way animals are kept and fed has a particularly strong influence on the quality of the product, of the foodstuff they go to produce."
"Accordingly, on the basis of my knowledge and day-to-day experiences, I hold this report in very high regard."
"I am also delighted that this report mentions animal protection with regard to the WTO, and particularly to imports from third countries."
"After all, it has to be made quite clear that, unless we succeed in making the breeding and keeping of all animals - be they from the EU or imported from third countries - subject to the same rules, there will be no benefit to European farmers, European animals or even European consumers, as production methods will simply not be as desired."
"All animals are living beings, as I have already said, and that is why I should like, in retrospect, to thank Mrs Jeggle most sincerely once more for her report."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Jeggle for her excellent report."
"We are going to vote tomorrow on this report, which is the result of long labours, and I am delighted at the common position that we have reached."
"I wish, however, to remind you of three fundamental issues, which are, actually, in the report and that I would like to bring to the fore."
"Firstly, I would like to stress the need to speed up the development, validation and approval of alternatives to testing on animals."
"We must give ourselves the financial and logistical means to find other methods that make it possible to avoid these tests."
"We must also limit and strictly regulate these tests in cases where an alternative is not yet possible."
"Secondly, we must not forget that improving animal welfare results mainly in increased production costs for European producers."
"I wish to stress, therefore, the need to validate their efforts through labelling and through information campaigns to explain the reason for a price difference."
"European producers must not be penalised because they respect the demands of the European Union and improve our food and, for their part, consumers need to know that the price increases result from an improvement in that food."
"Thanks to the creation of a European label and to the organisation of appropriate marketing and information campaigns, consumers will be able to identify those goods produced with particular regard for animal welfare."
"Thirdly, animal welfare must not be a European value only."
"The measures that we are adopting within the European Union must also be respected in all those countries from which we import meat."
"This is vital on both economic and quality grounds."
"The European Commission must do its utmost, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, to make the WTO give more attention to animal welfare and to upward harmonisation of measures relating to it."
"In the long term, clearly the aim must be to reach a level of protection for animals that is as high and as uniform as possible on the global scale."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Jeggle, ladies and gentlemen, the Jeggle report contains many aspects necessary and urgent in order to take forward animal protection throughout Europe."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give priority to all tests aiming to promote informed purchasing decisions by consumers. After all, in free-market consumer societies, the consumer is king."
"He or she decides whether our chickens lie on straw bedding or are chained to iron bars before they disappear down our throats as Chicken McNuggets; whether our pigs are pumped full of medicines to enable them to survive the torments of their short lives; or whether stray cats and dogs are skinned to make stylish trimmings for winter coats."
"Consumers have the power to determine whether to boost and support those farmers in Europe to whom animal protection, keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species and healthy foodstuffs are important, or whether to force our farmers to participate in global dumping, with rock-bottom standards and prices."
"I am convinced that the majority of well-informed, enlightened consumers would never buy a product that had suffered agonising torment before ending up on the shelves."
"Human beings have a tendency to bury their heads in the sand."
"They prefer not to admit the reality of such sad things as animal suffering when they put a joint in the oven."
"It is our political duty to ensure that consumers are informed about the real conditions of production."
"We politicians must spread our knowledge."
"The power of advice on packaging is demonstrated by the warnings on cigarette packs."
"The Jeggle report calls for a labelling programme to resolve the difficulties consumers have in recognising products that have taken particular account of animal protection."
"I would make an appeal for us to be courageous in this regard."
"The consumer should also be able to tell what has been produced at the cost of appalling animal suffering."
"In this case, the consumer would certainly not reach for the cheap goods, but opt for a somewhat dearer product that would show his credentials as a animal lover."
"We Europeans are much too defensive in this respect."
"Let us not be intimidated by cheap competition from third countries: we cannot possibly produce as cheaply as they do in any case."
"Let us put our trust in the ever growing community of consumers who make conscious decisions when choosing what to buy and opt for products that guarantee animals are treated with respect."
"Mr President, I should like to express my respect to Mrs Jeggle for her work."
"It was not a straightforward job, and there are still some inconsistencies to be found, but, on the whole, the line it takes is the right one - Mrs Jeggle is not to blame for the inconsistencies."
"I agree with her that our high animal-protection standards must be an example to the world."
"This is particularly applicable since we have not made a particularly good impression as a cultural area in recent years."
"I am thinking here of BSE, of dioxins, of the culls as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, of the millions of animals destroyed and burned on pyres - that was not a glorious chapter to show the world."
"For this reason, it is important that we adopt a new line in this regard."
"There is also a sales argument that needs to be taken into account when dealing directly with consumers."
"If there is someone who objects to chickens being kept in cages, you can say anything you like, but what he wants is a free-range egg - he has no appetite for the alternative when he thinks about the chicken."
"There must be market orientation according to considerations of animal protection, therefore; but we must also realise that animal protection entails costs."
"When we are dealing with anonymous markets - which is usually the case with imports from third countries - we must have qualified external protection to ensure that our standards are not circumvented, because this will be expressed in the price."
"I would say to Mrs Jeggle that the same applies within Europe, of course."
"If we do not ensure the implementation of animal protection standards in production, distortions of competition will occur within Europe, too."
"Consequently, we must consider including animal protection in cross-compliance, so that there are disincentives for businesses to violate animal protection standards in the form of not only certain penalties, but also financial losses - for example, deductions from premiums."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, let me say that I warmly welcome the animal welfare action plan."
"What I very much regret, though, is that this sort of thing should be needed in the first place."
"The way in which people treat animals often reveals their true nature, an image that is still not always that agreeable."
"It is still too often the case that animals are treated as commodities, with economic gain being more important than their well-being."
"I think that this report can at least put an end to a number of diabolical practices to which animals are subjected."
"The report includes something for which I have campaigned for a very long time, namely a ban on the practice of castrating piglets without any anaesthetic, which is not satisfactory for piglets or farmers."
"The fact that more active support is being demanded for research to replace animal tests by alternative test methods is a great improvement for many animals."
"Needless to say, I have many other ideas about animal protection that are more far-reaching, for example many more free-range cattle, the prevention of bull fighting, stopping the stuffing of geese with food to enlarge their livers, the banning of battery cages and far shorter transport times for animals, and I could go on for a while."
"It is unfortunate that a number of sound amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have been voted out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I should like to point out that animal welfare is certainly not just about agricultural animals; pets and wild animals should also fall within the scope of the action plan."
"I would call on everyone to let their compassionate hearts speak tomorrow in respect of our fellow creatures and give their full backing to more far-reaching amendments in favour of animals."
"We should demonstrate that we in this House do not behave like animals ourselves, but vote with their interests in mind."
"Mr President, the protection and welfare of animals is a challenge to human culture and civilisation in the 21st century."
"I am very pleased that my amendment expressing this idea was adopted for the draft resolution."
"Mahatma Gandhi once said that civilisation in a society can be gauged by the way it treats its animals."
"In 21st century Europe there is no place for cruelty to animals."
"It degrades our humanity, and there is no place for that."
"It is just a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans."
"The protection of animals should not be expressed in monetary terms, because our civilisation cannot be expressed in monetary terms."
"Animals should be protected from cruelty regardless of cost, but under one condition: that we apply the conditions of the European Union to all those who export their animal products to the European market."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the question of maintaining adequate standards of protection for animals in the EU Member States, and the resulting production of suitable food for consumers, is of great importance."
"For this reason everything must be done to ensure that only food of a high standard enters the common market."
"Strict measures must be taken to limit the import of products if there is any suspicion that European livestock farming standards have not been applied to them."
"Simply increasing taxes on unfair exporters will not bring any results."
"I would like to point out that to date it has not been possible for the Community to enforce respect for human rights, let alone animal rights."
"A large amount of food is exported into the European market from such countries."
"I would also like to say that small and family farms have traditionally treated their animals humanely, and it is large factory farms that diverge from these standards."
"Distortions have also arisen in relation to the issue of guidelines on the slaughter of animals."
"It is a serious mistake to prohibit the slaughter of animals for own consumption on family farms."
"This is a tradition which goes back centuries, and the farmers make sure that the animals are slaughtered in appropriate conditions."
"(DE) Mr President, as we know, a fair amount has happened since animal protection as a concept was born as a result of increasingly mechanised animal breeding in the 19th century."
"The Action Plan now under discussion is certainly a further important step in the right direction."
"As we know, the EU expressed its concern about dog, bull and cock fighting back in 2003 - and I am pleased to note that this is also reflected in the present document."
"Strangely, however, fox-hunting has been overlooked."
"Action is also needed, in my view, in the field of wild birds, as the EU still permits hunting of species whose populations have been declining for centuries."
"In my view, it is also particularly important to change our system of farming subsidies at long last so that, instead of benefiting mainly large landowners, they reward the practice of keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species, one in which the countless smallholders set an example."
"Finally, the abolition of export subsidies for animal transport would not only show more compassion for animals, but also protect the environment and help the people who suffer as a result of transit traffic."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I must congratulate the Commission on this proposal, and in particular I must congratulate Mrs Jeggle on this wonderful report and the great work that she has done."
"I simply wished to draw attention to paragraph 71."
"This paragraph calls for an end to dog, bull and cock fighting."
"When it talks about fighting by bulls, it is clearly talking about bullfights."
"To treat bullfights in the same way as dogfights and cockfights makes no sense whatsoever."
"Firstly, because bulls do not fight each other; it is not an animal fighting another animal; it is a very noble fight by a man against a bull, and sometimes it is the man who dies, or is often wounded."
"Furthermore, it is a tradition and a culture in our country."
"Maybe some people do not understand this, but the bull and bullfighting are very important for us, the Spanish."
"I would ask that people have as much respect for the traditions of my country as I have for those of other countries."
"Thank you very much."
"The bull contributes to the maintenance of pastures, it contributes to the protection of the environment and it contributes to rural development."
"Furthermore, of the bovine animals, it is the bull that has the best life; since we are talking about animal welfare, it should be pointed out that bulls are very well fed, they live in the open air, they run around in the way that animals like to do, and in the end they die fighting using their own defences."
"The bullfight is much nobler than hunting, where at the end of the day the animal dies without being able to defend itself."
"I would like to thank Mrs Jeggle and the whole of my political group, which has understood this and is going to ask that that word be removed from that paragraph."
"(ES) Mr President, animal welfare, which has been included in the CAP since the last reform, is already an achievement for European agriculture, though, according to the results of the special Eurobarometer carried out in 2005 on this issue, Europeans are unaware of the efforts being made by our producers and do not therefore appreciate them, despite the fact that we have the most protective legislation."
"The European Commission has already accepted that consumers need to be better informed on this issue if we want the efforts made by our farmers to be appreciated."
"This high level of protection has a high economic price, however, which may reduce the competitiveness of our agri-food industry."
"We need systematic impact studies that analyse the social and economic consequences of any new legislation and reliable scientific analyses that reflect the diversity of situations within the European Union and provide objective indicators of animal welfare and coherence with the Union's other policies and, in particular, with the Lisbon Strategy and with competitiveness and employment."
"There are therefore five fundamental aspects: improving communication with society, rigorous socio-economic analysis, solid scientific foundations, greater coherence with other common policies and the promotion of European standards in international fora."
"With regard to paragraph 71, I would like to say that my group is of course going to vote against that paragraph, amongst other things, and in particular because it contains a series of technical errors and involves a debate that is completely out of place here, a debate that is tarnishing the most important aspects of this report and, above all - I must say - the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, who has been efficient and conscientious and has adopted a very balanced approach."
"Mr President, I welcome the action plan and wish to thank Mrs Jeggle for her work."
"The awareness that many animals in the European Union are treated badly and that more has to be done is of great importance, not only out of charity but also because, as a developing market-based approach, the humane treatment of animals is an opportunity for European producers, if properly developed."
"Animal protection through law is regarded positively by a growing number of Europeans, and the labelling of food products from humanely-treated animals could eventually bring economic profits to producers and become a part of the European social model."
"On the other hand, global competition tends to push producers for profit at the lowest possible animal protection level."
"That is why the action plan is also a strong political message to the world."
"By defining our intentions for establishing minimum mandatory standards against the worst abuses, we underpin the need for discussion at a global level, at the level of the WTO."
"By setting priorities for better treatment of farm animals, by avoiding unnecessary suffering caused by tests that could be replaced and by banning the import of cruelty products, improving the treatment of animals during transport etc., we are pushing for global solutions."
"We would like to do more, as the amendments show, but the plan is, nevertheless, a solid beginning of a comprehensive EU policy in this area."
"(ES) Mr President, cruelty is not culture; causing suffering cannot be seen as entertainment."
"Mass industrial suffering is not a legitimate business."
"The demand for justice in our relations with animals calls into question our prevailing human morality and extends its scope."
"If we are to be successful in terms of animal welfare, we must reassess our traditional approach to moral responsibility and grant protection and rights also to individual non-human animals, which have sensory, emotional and intellectual capacities."
"If we are to recognise and extend the rights of animals we must stop causing them unnecessary suffering and refrain from cruelty."
"That is the purpose of this report."
"We Greens will support the proposal, with a series of amendments, and we will demand that the Council cease ignoring the majority of Europeans, who are in favour of stricter animal protection measures."
"It cannot continue to ignore them."
"We believe that we must act in an ethical and altruistic manner, but that we must also respond to people's needs and interests."
"We are in favour of improving animal welfare because only in that way can we improve human health, the environment and social justice."
"Mr President, so vast is the range of the initiatives proposed in this document that it should keep the EU bureaucrats happily beavering away for the next 20 years."
"However, let us examine one of the high points of the EU's record on animal welfare."
"In 2001, during the infamous foot-and-mouth outbreak, seven million animals were destroyed in Britain under the EU's direction; most of them were healthy."
"I well remember the huge funeral pyres of burning animals."
"The EU stubbornly refused to allow vaccination, which would have been in the best interests of the welfare of both the animals and British agriculture."
"It preferred instead the legally questionable and morally unjustifiable scorched-earth approach."
"Therefore, I do not believe that the EU is in any position to claim the moral high ground on animal welfare and to lecture the Member States about it, never mind the rest of the world, as this lofty document claims it will."
"We have everything in this report, including the setting-up of an animal protection information forum."
"Doubtless, this will be another highly expensive quango."
"Who is going to pay for it?"
"The taxpayers."
"Who is going to have to do all the paperwork?"
"The farmers, who can barely cope with the current red tape."
"This document is obsessed with standardisation and uniformity."
"It appears to take no account of the widely differing farming cultures and climates to be found in countries as diverse as Portugal and Sweden."
"It takes no account of the already high standards of animal welfare in Britain."
"It is predicated around the central thesis that the EU can do it better, but that is not so."
"(NL) Mr President, before I give my reaction, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent report and the good balance she has struck between what is and is not possible and what we want for animal welfare in Europe;"
"I should also like to respond to Mr Titford's remark to the effect that European bureaucracy is responsible for the slaughter of 7 million animals in Great Britain during the foot-and-mouth crisis."
"I should like to put him right on that score: When Great Britain joined the European Union, Europe was forced to change its legislation."
"We were no longer allowed to vaccinate as a preventive measure."
"We were no longer allowed to vaccinate for foot-and-mouth disease."
"We owe this to the British Government at the time, so please do not try to tell me that Europe is to blame for the slaughter of 7 million cows in Great Britain, for it has everything to do with the British position at the time."
"I just wanted to get that off my chest."
"I am also saying this, because Mrs Jeggle's report states quite clearly that vaccination should be a valid instrument for improved animal welfare in the European Union."
"In view of the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases, it is good we are making some headway and are in any event using scientific techniques in order to fight them."
"That is the best form of animal welfare in Europe."
"A second point I wanted to raise concerns animal transport."
"We in this House have asked for a reduction in the duration of transport that involves animals intended for slaughter."
"Unfortunately, the Council has not taken this on board, but the position of Parliament is clear."
"In that sense, I should like to urge Mr Titford, if he really wishes to protect animal welfare in his own country too, to vote in favour of the Jeggle report."
"That is essential, for then you will really do the citizens of Great Britain and those of Europe a good turn."
"The third reason why I welcome this report is that it draws particular attention to the import of products from outside of the European Union."
"After all, we may have fine rules and regulations, but if we cannot carry out any monitoring on Europe's external borders, then they will remain immaterial; it is essential that this House should use the Jeggle report to put this back on the agenda."
"(PL) Mr President, if animals could speak I am sure they would thank the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for standing up for them."
"In her, they have an ardent spokesperson and guardian."
"The report deserves considerable recognition."
"It addresses all the most important issues including protection of both animals on farms and those living in the wild."
"The rapporteur has also addressed transportation, production economics, international aspects, product labelling, the use of animals for research, humanitarian slaughter and so on. I believe that, with all our help, the aims stated in the report, of which there are many, are achievable."
"We should, however, pay particular attention to making society more sensitive to the issue, to continued involvement of international organisations, and spreading awareness which will allow us to achieve the same results as with seal hunting."
"There is nothing that needs to be added to the report."
"I offer the rapporteur my warmest congratulations, and so do all the animals."
"(SV) Mr President, a civilised society can never compete on the basis of lowest prices, with animals reared under conditions resembling torture."
"Only by means of stringent demands in terms of animal protection will animal husbandry in the EU survive."
"The future lies in local production and short distances for animal transport, as well as in consumer protection, with animals reared in natural conditions."
"We have an agricultural policy that causes suffering to broilers, forces animals to be transported over long distances, causes pigs to be castrated and provides more medicines to animals than to people."
"It is not pigs, but an agricultural policy like this that should be castrated."
"A maximum time limit of eight hours for the transport of animals is a reasonable demand."
"Minimum standards of animal protection - as per Amendment 11 - are necessary."
"We have become as many as four times richer over the last 40 years."
"If we cannot afford to sacrifice a percentage of this wealth in order to protect defenceless animals, we cannot call ourselves civilised."
"To my Spanish friends I would say the following: a noble fight would be an unarmed matador against an unarmed bull that is untreated, does not have its back broken, is not drugged and is not tortured."
"That is what would constitute a noble fight."
"The way such fights look at present, however, they are about cruelty to animals, something that must not be subsidised."
"Thank you, Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, Mrs Jeggle, for a very good report, because it is essential that we look after animals in Europe."
"Actually, we have a very good record here because we have high production standards, but we need to be very much consumer-driven."
"I agree with one of the previous speakers who said that the consumer must have the choice and must be able to see the labels and be absolutely sure of that production."
"If you go into a supermarket and look at a free-range chicken or an organic chicken or an intensively-farmed broiler chicken, you can actually see no difference between them."
"You have to be absolutely confident that the label is right."
"Not only does it have to be right for the production that we have here in Europe, but it also has to be right for the production that comes in from outside Europe as well."
"So consumers have to be very confident of the labelling."
"We also have to see a reduction in animals used for testing, and that is where we have to be very careful with European legislation as well, because, if we are not careful, REACH may actually increase the number of animals tested unnecessarily."
"Can I refer to Mr Titford and put him right on one or two things?"
"First of all, he sees European bureaucrats under every bed, I think, but, as far as foot-and-mouth is concerned, it was the UK Government that was absolutely determined to slaughter."
"It was the UK Government that was so worried that a general election was being delayed that they had what was called the 'contiguous cull', which slaughtered millions of animals unnecessarily."
"In the Netherlands, they actually carried out vaccinations to try and stop the mass funeral pyres."
"So, Mr Titford, it was not the European Union that had a problem with foot-and-mouth disease: it was the UK Government."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"Mrs Jeggle is a sensitive, capable and excellent Member of the European Parliament."
"The great Indian leader, Ghandi, said that when man treats animals well he demonstrates his humanity and his higher feelings."
"As such, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, without any doubts."
"However, I would like to highlight a delicate and important point which has to do with livestock farming, which has to do with man."
"I do not refer to domestic animals, to cockfights or to dogfights, on which I agree with the rapporteur; I refer to reared animals."
"If the measures in the report, which - I repeat - I endorse and support, are applied, then our livestock farmers will have higher production costs, meaning that either we shall have to support them financially or we shall have to find ways of controlling the living conditions of animals reared in third countries whose meat is imported into the European Union."
"Otherwise, we shall achieve nothing."
"European livestock farming will shrink due to unfair competition and we shall demonstrate that we are hypocrites rather than animal lovers and that we have no sense of proper solidarity with livestock farmers."
"Apart from that, I should like to highlight another issue."
"I should like stricter controls on wild animal hunting."
"Many of our mountains and forests no longer have any wild animals because there is uncontrolled, predatory murder of the animals and this does not only have to do with the animals."
"It disrupts the entire ecosystem in the mountains and forests of Europe and the rest of the world."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her work."
"This initiative responds to a social concern, one that I believe it is crucial for us to confront, not just in the European Union, but throughout the world."
"Animal welfare is important, and it is important that we have a single European standard and that it be respected by all of the countries of the European Union."
"We have been worldwide pioneers in relation to these standards, and they must be respected, because there are few States in the world that can say that they conform to standards like those we apply in the European Union."
"We have recently talked, for example, about the rearing of chicken for meat and the transport of animals; and in this report by Mrs Jeggle we are not just talking about production farms, but also, for example, about exhibiting animals, about zoos, about circuses and about research and development - areas in which animals are also used."
"We must also talk about domestic animals that we keep as pets in our homes and that also require our attention."
"We must not, of course, be tolerant with people who abandon them, allow them to die of hunger or abuse them."
"We must apply serious and scientific criteria that ensure that the animals that we keep as pets in our daily lives in the European Union are happy."
"To this end, I would like to point out that we have held hearings in this Parliament in which we have heard international experts, such as Dr Gonsálvez, from Spain, who have told us that we must prevent epizootic diseases and invest in their prevention, that we must invest in complying with standards governing densities of animals in farms and that we must educate children to respect animals."
"We must also, of course, prevent cases such as paragraph 71, introduced as a result of the ignorance and lack of knowledge of certain members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who have mixed up two entirely different issues by failing to respect the art, the traditions and the culture of other people who do not think in the same way as them and who are exemplary in terms of freedom and respect for diversity."
"We will therefore vote against that paragraph 71, though we fully respect the views of those who do not think in the same way as us."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything that humans do to animals comes back to them: Pythagoras realised this as much as two-and-a-half-thousand years ago."
"Looking at the interaction between animal protection, animal health, sustainability, and environmental and food safety, I can see that this is still true today."
"Thankfully, animal protection now plays a major part in our society."
"The public's desire for ethically and socially sound products is increasing, and recently we have been increasingly dealing with sensitive issues such as animal protection relating to breeding, transport and slaughter."
"I welcome the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals, and I congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her report, in which she specifies unequivocally what is needed."
"We need measures to keep the public better informed about modern animal-protection methods and applied animal protection."
"We must improve marketing, and also labelling and communication strategies, to inform consumers and thus assist them in their purchasing decisions."
"A simple, precise 'EU label' for animal protection could help us harmonise the currently diverging systems of animal-protection labelling and lay down minimum standards for animal protection applicable throughout the EU - and, I hope, beyond our borders, too, in the near future."
"We must not forget to involve animal breeders and keepers and also public opinion in this animal-protection policy, however."
"Why is it that Community animal-protection policy has been restricted to farmed animals up to now?"
"Are cats and dogs not worth protecting just because we do not eat them?"
"This appears to be a legitimate question, as does the one as to whether pets are always kept in conditions appropriate to their species."
"We hear of all sorts of things taking place, for example birds being kept in cages, and snakes and other reptiles in urban flats."
"That is why this view has a rightful place in the report."
"We have been advocating a reduction in the use of animals in research, science and product approval."
"Animal testing should be carried out only in the absence of any alternatives."
"Mr President, thank you for what has been, overall, a very interesting and supportive debate."
"I shall inform my colleague, Mr Kyprianou, of your comments."
"I should like to touch upon just a couple of your comments."
"Mr Holm emphasised trade issues and suggested that competition is incompatible with animal welfare;"
"I disagree."
"It will be very difficult for EU producers to compete in the global market on the basis of price alone."
"This is clear if you look at the competitive advantage of certain third countries in terms of lower land, labour or infrastructure costs."
"Instead, I think high animal welfare standards should be promoted as one of our competitive advantages."
"We should also remember that, as Mr Tarabella said, there needs to be real choice for consumers."
"Recent surveys and research projects have demonstrated consumers' active interest in the welfare of farm animals."
"It is clear that consumers believe that they can improve animal welfare through their purchasing power and that a large proportion would be prepared to pay a premium price for such products."
"Ms Resetarits also emphasised this point."
"The Commission thinks that labelling will eventually make these products more competitive, to the benefit of the industry, and in particular to those who produce in a welfare-friendly manner."
"We believe that Europe's high animal welfare standards need to be seen as a marketing opportunity and a competitive advantage, rather than as a burden or liability."
"The policy of using vaccination to prevent the spread of animal diseases has been carefully considered by the Commission and is now integrated into the specific Community legislation on foot-and-mouth disease prevention."
"The same principles are today in the avian influenza measures just adopted."
"I have to remind Mrs Ayuso González that the Treaty does not allow the Community to act in respect of the use of animals in cultural and traditional events, such as bullfighting."
"Therefore, the action plan does not foresee any measures in this regard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I welcome this debate."
"The EU has slowly but surely improved the welfare of animals through a number of measures relating to the housing and transportation of animals."
"We now have to build on this and develop quantifiable animal welfare indicators and create a formal framework for animal welfare impact assessments for future EU policies."
"We should also look at the introduction of an EU labelling scheme to identify products produced from higher welfare standard systems to enable consumers to make informed choices."
"Finally, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I would place particular emphasis on establishing internationally recognised animal welfare standards for trade."
"(SV) Proper animal protection is a necessity in a modern society."
"There are big differences between the EU Member States when it comes to animal protection."
"It may therefore be appropriate to have certain common rules, for example where the transport of animals is concerned."
"The June List sees the EU as a union of values, where ethical issues in relation to animals are important."
"We are, however, doubtful about and, indeed, opposed to having an animal protection authority under the auspices of the EU."
"The existing structures in the EU Member States should be sufficient."
"If there were Community legislation, the Member States would be forced to apply it."
"If they did not do so, the Commission, in the first place, and ultimately the European Court of Justice would have to take measures against the state or states that did not comply with the legislation."
"As so often, it is very difficult to strike a balance between decision-making at EU level and decision-making at national, regional or local levels."
"There are, however, certain values that must be protected at any cost, such as human rights and basic animal protection."
"This should preferably be done at international level."
"Follow-up to the report on competition in professional services (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on follow-up to the report on competition in professional services."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by presenting a report in September of last year on professional services under the heading 'Scope for more reform', the Commission has actually expanded on the report it had already drawn up back in 2004 on the topic of competition in professional services."
"Parliament expressed its views on this on the basis of the reports from 2001 and 2003."
"In March of this year, the Committee on Legal Affairs and this House again positioned themselves in relation to the special sector of legal professions."
"What links all public discussions, between economists, as well as between Parliament and the Commission, is a significant phenomenon: all participants have extremely forthright opinions but are weak when it comes to figures."
"The figures which form the basis of the mainly sector-specific or national investigations largely date from the early 90s. The most recent investigation dates from the start of 2001."
"What unites all of the investigations, however, is the fact that they are either limited to specific sectors or nationally or that they are founded precisely on an empirical basis which basically goes so far back that it is barely suitable for generalisation purposes."
"Viewed rationally, the economic importance of the services cannot be overestimated."
"8% of European GDP is made up of business services, of which at least one third can be attributed to professional services."
"In this respect, and I believe that Parliament also welcomes this in the context of the Lisbon agenda, it is entirely justified asking what contribution this sector may make to growth and employment in Europe."
"It seemed important to us to not just approve the Lisbon agenda using nice speeches but to also get involved in this specific instance in the question as to what contribution liberalisation can make to growth."
"The Commission should be commended in bringing some sort of order to a discussion which hitherto, I should say, has run wild."
"Basically, the Commission has made the following economic consideration: First of all, it has looked at six professions: lawyers, notaries, engineers, architects, pharmacists and accountants."
"It has defined five restrictions on competition (fixed prices, recommended prices, rules of competition, advertising rules and the entire gamete of entry restrictions, business structures and merger practices)."
"The Commission has put forward four large categories of consumer for comparison purposes - public authorities, large enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises and private consumers - and then acknowledged that certain special regulations apply here given the presence of asymmetries - in the sphere of market transparency, as far as externalities are concerned, or on the issue as to what extent a public good is furnished here."
"This rationalisation is welcomed. It enables discussions to proceed and makes it logical for Parliament to position itself in relation to this discussion at this time."
"For our part, we have tried, on the one hand, to lend a degree of support, but also, on the other, to contribute to differentiation as regards this discussion."
"First of all, it needs to be emphasised that there is a large amount of agreement on the theme of subsidiarity."
"The difficult task of achieving coordination between Member States on this subject will fall to the European Community."
"We have requested, on the other hand, and I consider this to be extremely important, also as a result of the discussion on the Services Directive, that the objectives of liberalisation are clearly named and empirical evidence produced too."
"What level of growth is expected from which liberalisations?"
"What is the desired impact on employment?"
"This also really needs to be stated in terms of figures, otherwise there will not be sufficient acceptance in the Member States."
"We have emphasised that we see self-administration having equal status vis-à-vis state regulation."
"We have said we believe that we must differentiate between this system."
"By way of example, we must distinguish between public authorities because there is a difference between whether a small community invites tenders or whether a nation state invites tenders for professional services."
"We have stated that whilst we recognise the geographical and traditional conditions, we view them as special regulations which do not obviate the necessity of continual analysis in these sectors as to what opportunities for liberalisation and growth exist there."
"We have stated in no uncertain terms that we consider special regulations regarding mergers and advertising to be dubious."
"We have stated that we want to differentiate clearly between certain restrictions on competition according to categories of consumers and finally, we have stated that in the very area of voluntariness, the voluntary Code of Conduct for professional services is very welcome indeed."
"The crux of the matter is that we want to go back to the Commission saying that we welcome these observations."
"It must also be stated categorically, however, that rationalisation, further differentiation in these areas, is required."
"Only then will the necessary acceptance be achieved in the nation states."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Dr Ehler and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for this report."
"The Commission welcomes your support for the work that needs to be done in the sector."
"Your assessment of the importance of professional services to the EU economy is welcome and pertinent."
"Reform by Member States in this sector must be an integral part of delivering the Lisbon and Better Regulation agendas."
"The Commission fully supports your call for us all to work together constructively."
"We agree, too, that is important to learn from the experience of Member States which have already taken steps to modernise."
"We think you are right to insist that Member States eliminate special advertising and business structure restrictions and ensure fair and equal access to the professions, including eliminating geographic and demographic rules on entry."
"Your call for more economic evidence is a fair one, but let us not forget that we are not proposing harmonisation of regulation in the professions."
"Member States remain free to determine regulatory solutions based on national needs and circumstances."
"So our experience is that the best way to add value is through historical and international comparisons."
"And that is why we have commissioned another piece of external comparative research to look at the EU property services market - selling and buying property."
"That study will evaluate the impact of professional regulation on consumer choice, price, quality and other important indicators and, where feasible, the effect on jobs and growth."
"National authorities can also play an important role in evaluating the impact of reforms already undertaken."
"They, along with key stakeholders, such as professional bodies, are likewise well placed to evaluate the current state of regulation of the professions in their countries, explore what can be modernised and evaluate the impact of possible reforms on growth and jobs."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the professions make up one of the areas of excellence in the provision of services."
"In the majority of European countries, although not in all of them, basic regulation dates back to the codification of civil law on contracts."
"Obviously this is primarily in civil law countries."
"Over time, the professions have become the jewel in the crown of civil society, but often also a conservative and closed field, risking the loss of their outstanding quality in order to keep their privileges."
"In this way, in some countries and in some sectors a closed caste has been created, often inaccessible on the basis of merit, but increasingly and all too often based solely on the hereditary line."
"The European Parliament has been asked to reflect on the issue of services in the internal market, and will vote tomorrow on the report on competition in professional services."
"This year as never before, therefore, it is laying the foundations for finding a balance between, on the one hand, opening up to competition and therefore liberalising access, with particular attention to young people at the end of their training, and, on the other hand, safeguarding the quality of service, not least to protect European citizens."
"It is also laying the foundations for defining a reference legal framework, identifying critical points to be removed, principles to be respected and procedures to be followed for reference checks; a legal framework within which Member States will be free to make decisions, fully in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which has also been mentioned earlier."
"The text is the result of constructive work by the various political groups."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his willingness in practice to discuss and accept the majority of the amendments, many of which were submitted by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Parliament is adopting a clear stand with regard to the services sector: it wants to gradually remove regulatory barriers and obstacles, not because it has an uncritical, sceptical attitude that cannot tolerate red tape and wants to dismantle the existing system, but rather so that it can encourage that positive competition and openness to transparency and innovation that is a fundamental part of sustainable economic growth and consumer protection."
"Regulation and self-regulation in the professional services sector must be in line with the Lisbon Strategy, in particular with the protection of the general interest, and must not result in discrimination, particularly discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, nationality or gender."
"The proposals contained in the report are a move in that direction, and include: the promotion of codes of conduct, with a decisive role assigned to all stakeholders, not least through representative organisations; importance given to removing bans on advertising, which is seen as a genuine information service for consumers, in particular regarding the nature and cost of services; support for establishing inter-professional and multidisciplinary services to encourage innovation and competitiveness in an ever more complex world; and focus on creating conditions to ease the transition from university education to professional practice."
"I hope that there will be support for the amendment we are submitting to Parliament asking Member States to abolish the system of fixed or minimum fees and the ban on negotiating payment linked to the outcome achieved, where they act as obstacles to the quality of services and to competition."
"I believe that there is still a long way to go, and that the Member States must look within themselves to find the best possible combination of respect for tradition and innovative development of professional services, a key factor in developing the productive system and the social market economy that characterises Europe in a globalised world."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the desirability of reforming the professions in Europe has been discussed since time immemorial."
"There are contrasting opinions on this."
"Some people, including the former Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, have always come out in favour of what they describe as necessary liberalisation, within a general framework of reform geared towards revitalising the European economy."
"Others, however, maintain that the current system guarantees citizens a certain level of quality of service and should therefore be retained."
"I personally recognise the importance of professional services as drivers of European economic growth, and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to begin a process of reform of the sector, aimed at liberalising professional services."
"Excessive regulation, rigid fees, few professional organisations, and even fewer multidisciplinary organisations, as well as advertising restrictions, act as an obstacle to revitalising competitiveness in Europe and often do not allow a high level of quality of services to be ensured."
"All of that must also be seen from the point of view of paying greater attention to protecting citizens."
"It is citizens that we as MEPs are called on to represent, and citizens that benefit from professional services."
"In many regions, the interest of users is often sacrificed to the rewards of position."
"Situations of oligopoly, where sometimes it would not be strictly true to speak of monopoly, result in higher prices for professional services and cause an added cost that is invariably passed on to consumers."
"Furthermore, I agree with the rapporteur that it is appropriate to dispense with special regulations in the field of advertising, in order to allow professionals to inform users of the services offered and the relevant prices."
"On the other hand, I do of course believe that a regulatory effort is needed to strengthen the bans on misleading advertising and to provide instruments for the practical protection of consumers/users."
"In conclusion, from the point of view of reconciling the need for greater competitiveness in professional services, through liberalisation, with consumer protection, I support the rapporteur's worthwhile proposal on the adoption of codes of conduct and self-regulation."
"I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Ehler once again on his excellent work."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, it is not self-evident that competition in the liberal professions should be unlimited, and that is once again demonstrated by the Ehler report, and also by practical experience."
"In the Netherlands, for example, fixed prices for notarial services have been abolished, while many other rules have remained intact."
"Those rules are needed to guarantee quality."
"I was approached very recently, for example, with the question by a remedial educationalist who wanted to establish himself freely without going through the usual registration procedure with the Ministry of Public Health."
"The government was right to prescribe additional requirements in terms of training for registration and compensation, something that is, of course, vitally important for public health services."
"The registration requirements for different professional groups still form an obstacle to establishing oneself in a liberal profession, and there are, to some extent, good reasons for this."
"The guarantee for professional services cannot be made if people can set up in a liberal profession without any restrictions."
"The rapporteur's amendment aimed at drawing this subtle distinction in the report is therefore necessary."
"(DE) Mr President, it is certainly to be welcomed if partly antiquated professional codes of conduct are reviewed in terms of their necessity in the case of independent professions."
"In my opinion, however, it is not a question of deregulating all the sectors affected in the same way, irrespective of their different nature."
"It is known that independent professions provide high-quality services which are in the public interest."
"In my view, we should not undertake any experiments in this area."
"The fact that in Argentina and France, for instance, second thoughts are being given to the reintroduction of statutory tariffs for notaries shows that deregulation is not perfect."
"A sharp increase in the number of lawyers with a simultaneous relaxation in the Fees Ordinance has led to a situation in Germany, for instance, whereby highly qualified legal advice is only offered at staggeringly high hourly rates while at the lower end of the market, a great many lawyers work for rock bottom prices."
"It is paradoxical if the Commission intends, on the one hand, to limit occupational rights but, on the other, is calling for codes of conduct to be drawn up and the introduction of new quality controls following the abolition of regulatory measures."
"Thank you, Mr President, for a stimulating debate."
"I would like to respond to a couple of the most important issues that have been raised."
"Mr Ehler called for better economic analysis of the impact of changes on jobs and growth - and rightly so."
"On assessing the economic impact of reforms: as I mentioned, the fact there are no plans to harmonise professional regulation across the EU means it would be very difficult to predict impact accurately."
"We favour comparative assessment of what differences real changes have actually made on the ground in the Member States that have already introduced them."
"That is why we see a strong role for the national authorities, which are well placed when they undertake these analyses, but we will also further reflect on what more we might do to facilitate the building of the economic evidence base at EU level."
"Talking about liberal professions, such as lawyer, requires tough ethical rules and qualities."
"The Commission fully accepts that genuine ethical rules are essential to ensure good governance and practice in professions such as lawyer."
"In this respect, one standard should apply no matter to whom the services are provided: fixing prices or banning advertising do not deliver high ethical standards and good quality services."
"Quality and observance of ethical standards are better ensured and controlled by adequate training requirements and by effective supervision by the States and/or by professional bodies, including effective complaints procedures for clients."
"Codes of conduct, as mentioned here, also represent a positive step."
"The Commission supports the removal of fixed and minimum prices and the use of result-based fees."
"There is no evidence to suggest that in the Member States where fixed and minimum prices have been removed there has been a deterioration in the quality or ethical standards of legal services."
"Though quality has a price, a fixed price does not in itself guarantee quality."
"Price competition with the possibility of undercutting fixed minimum fees and the use of success fees will, rather, enhance access to justice."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"EU economic and trade relations with Mercosur (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on economic and trade relations between the EU and Mercosur with a view to the conclusion of an Interregional Association Agreement."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by informing you that Commissioner Mandelson has contacted me to explain why he is not attending this debate, and I am grateful to him for that."
"The reason is the Summit on India in Finland; this led to an interesting conversation with the Commissioner on the agreement with Mercosur, in which I explained to him that, as well as India or China, Brazil and the Mercosur group are also emerging powers, a view that the Commissioner certainly, and fortunately, shares."
"Let us hope that, when the bleak scenes of the Doha Round have faded away, when the elections in Brazil have taken place and when the political, economic and commercial foundations for the European Union's relations with Mercosur have been laid, which is this Parliament's intention in the report we are presenting today, we will take the definitive steps to guide the final phase of the negotiation of an ambitious European Union-Mercosur Association Agreement."
"That is the intention of our report: to restore a political, economic and commercial priority, to establish a collection of principles, rules and guidelines that give form to a strategic political priority, and to strengthen the framework for relations between two trading blocs."
"If we can bring them together by means of an Association Agreement which, together with the political aspects of cooperation, involves an agreement on the creation of a free trade area, we will have taken the historic step of creating the world's largest such free trade area."
"At a time when new powers are emerging in the East, this would be a way to enhance the mutual interests of two blocs that are united by history and culture, with all the benefits that that would bring to our citizens on both continents."
"We are talking about a combined population of more than 700 million inhabitants."
"Our report therefore calls for a full, ambitious and balanced agreement based on three pillars: a political and institutional chapter reinforcing democratic dialogue and political cooperation; a cooperation chapter promoting sustainable economic and social development; and a trade chapter establishing an advanced free-trade area with a broad agenda including, as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, investment, public procurement, the protection of intellectual property rights, cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments, trade facilitation, and a binding dispute settlement mechanism."
"Mexico and Chile are good examples of how our relations can be intensified by means of an association instrument."
"With Mercosur representing 45% of the population of Latin America and the region's largest market, as well as 45% of its GDP, the great potential for growth on both sides is clear."
"Furthermore, unlike what is happening in Latin America as a whole, where US imports are three times higher than those from the EU, in Mercosur the EU quota is about 25% compared with 20% from the United States."
"According to the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, the costs of not reaching an agreement are estimated to be some EUR 3.7 billion per annum in trade and goods, rising to over EUR 5 billion if one includes investment and services."
"The trade agreement must be wide-ranging and cover all sectors, though the specific sensitivity of certain products must of course be taken into account, as the report indicates."
"We did not wish to look into the details of the agreement's impact on the different sub-sectors, but rather we thought it appropriate to analyse the issue as a whole, to analyse the mutual interests at stake in the negotiation altogether."
"Our report therefore refers both to the EU's interests in Mercosur and to Mercosur's interests in the EU, and specific sections are dedicated to such important aspects as agriculture, with references to subsidies, geographical designations, bioethanol, etc.;"
"NAMAs, where we include a special reference to fisheries and the sensitivity of certain processed products, such as canned tuna; services, where it is essential to achieve real improvements and clear and stable regulatory frameworks; investments, which are fundamental for sustainable economic development and generating employment and prosperity; public procurement and intellectual property, as well as the clear identification of possible barriers to trade and the approximation of rules on certification, accreditation, standardisation, etc., to promote fair trade and competition; and the establishment of an agreed dispute settlement instrument."
"As well as the strictly technical and commercial aspects, the report also covers the mechanisms necessary for the industrial, employment and social cooperation of small and medium-sized businesses and aspects relating to technology, science, environmental measures, energy and communication, as well as European Union aid and solidarity mechanisms."
"Finally, we include the necessary inter-parliamentary cooperation between the European Parliament and the Mercosur Parliament in order to make the agreement more democratically representative and bring the sometimes excessively technical aspects of the agreement more into line with the feelings of the citizens we represent, thereby giving the agreement a greater popular dimension."
"We believe that, by means of this report, the European Parliament is making clear its support for a far-reaching and ambitious Association Agreement between the old continent and a large part of the new continent, which we want to be integrated, and we call upon the Commission to speed up the negotiations so that the agreement can become a reality as soon as possible, for the benefit of the citizens of both continents."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking all of the parliamentary groups for their invaluable understanding and support."
"I have received much understanding and support and I needed as much of it as possible in order to achieve the broad consensus that we wanted."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Peter Mandelson, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade on the report on economic and trade relations between the EU and Mercosur with a view to the conclusion of an Interregional Association Agreement."
"This report gives a very comprehensive picture of the current relations between the EU and Mercosur in the economic as well as the political field, and the European Commission shares most of the analysis presented in this report."
"The European Commission very much concurs with the Committee on International Trade in its view that a conclusion of an ambitious and balanced Association Agreement between the EU and Mercosur is a strategic objective."
"The Commission remains firmly committed to concluding the Agreement with Mercosur as soon as it is technically and politically feasible."
"Such an agreement would be the platform for promoting the relationship between the two regions and for promoting the common values and objectives that unite us."
"An EU-Mercosur agreement would establish the first ever region-to-region association and the largest free-trade area in the world, covering almost 700 million people."
"As the INTA report points out, such an Association Agreement would enable both regions to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation."
"It would enhance the competitiveness of our economies, increase growth and thereby contribute to economic and social cohesion."
"Creating the world's largest market place would give an enormous boost to job creation, economic reform and productivity levels."
"A free-trade agreement with Mercosur is a very good example of how EU trade policy can contribute to the EU's wider approach to economic reform and competitiveness."
"A region-to-region agreement with Mercosur would also serve as an instrument to support an integration effort within Mercosur and Latin America."
"The accession of Venezuela to Mercosur this year implies an enlargement of the region and the European Commission also hopes that the process of broadening and deepening regional integration will continue."
"We know from our own European experience that the reforms and adjustments necessary for integration are not easy."
"But we also know that the rewards make the effort worthwhile."
"An Agreement would also create a more transparent and stable business environment for the EU and Mercosur companies."
"This would contribute to attracting more investment flows."
"Investment - and future investment - could possibly have the biggest impact on the shape of our future economic partnership with Mercosur."
"Although foreign direct investment to Mercosur increased in 2004 and 2005, the relative share of the region in relation to global EU investments has been sliding ever since the 1990s."
"This is a source of concern, as investment means transfer of know-how, of industrialisation and jobs."
"This relative downward trend of the Mercosur region in relation to the rest of the world, especially Asia, is one of the challenges of the future agreement and, possibly, its main potential economic benefit."
"Let me just say a few words on the timing."
"In the report by the International Trade Committee, you request the establishment of a negotiating calendar which would allow us to conclude the EU-Mercosur negotiations as soon as possible."
"The European Commission is fully committed to concluding these negotiations as soon as is technically and politically feasible, but we have always been of the opinion that substance prevails over timing."
"What we want to achieve is an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced agreement which goes beyond our WTO commitments."
"As the INTA report points out, there is a cost to not having an Agreement."
"But there is also a long-term cost in missed opportunities from having a bad agreement."
"Related to the issue of timing is the link between these biregional negotiations, the progress of the WTO Doha Development Agenda and the sequence of the two negotiations."
"In this respect, the European Commission fully agrees with the analysis of the report by INTA; both these processes can realise substantial synergies."
"They are not mutually exclusive; they are complementary."
"To conclude, let me convey to you the following message, which I am sure that you share with me: for strategic and political reasons, the European Commission remains committed to negotiating and concluding an ambitious and balanced agreement with Mercosur."
"Trade is an important element of this agreement but not the only one."
"Beyond the trade negotiations, we should not lose sight of the strategic, political and economic rationale of this agreement."
"Let us not forget the strategic dimension of a future Association Agreement, which is to promote a relationship between regional blocs which enhances peace, stability, prosperity, social progress and democracy."
"Mr President, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Varela, for his extremely successful report on economic and trade relations between the European Union and Mercosur with a view to the conclusion of an interregional association agreement."
"The report is an important one, and it has come out at an appropriate moment."
"As we know, negotiations regarding the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement have a long and rather troubled history."
"In the current situation - the failure of the Doha talks - we need to put out a strong and clear signal that an association agreement is necessary and favourable both to Mercosur members and to European Union members."
"There is also a need for greater political involvement in and support for the final success of the EU-Mercosur negotiations."
"I believe that the rapporteur has been very successful here."
"The report sends out a positive signal and can play an important and positive role in mapping out the next stages of the negotiations."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for taking into account many submissions and comments from the report of the Committee on Development, which I represented as a draftsman."
"I would like to thank you for emphasising the importance of maintaining balance between trade and development in the final text of the agreement so that the sections relating to trade do not conflict with the sections on development, and for underlining the need to establish guarantees that the provisions on cooperation are effective in combating poverty and are in accordance with the EU's negotiating policy."
"The Committee on Development drew attention to various aspects of development cooperation."
"It is clear that better economic and trade conditions can contribute towards resolving some of the social problems that exist in the Mercosur countries."
"The Committee on Development underlines the need to increase support for social development, education, reducing social inequalities, more equal distribution of income, and reduction of poverty."
"We also believe that we should support small and medium-sized enterprises and balance farming, tourism and infrastructure investment with protection for the natural environment."
"An important advantage of this report is that it provides institutional reinforcement of Mercosur."
"One of the ways it proposes to do this is by strengthening cooperation at parliamentary level, which would have a very positive effect."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on the excellent work that he has done on behalf of the Committee on International Trade."
"I would also like to express my regret at the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Mandelson, although at least he has had the courtesy to call the rapporteur to explain, which does not happen very often in these cases."
"In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr President, I would like to say that I would have liked to have obtained a firmer commitment from the Commission with regard to the timetable called for by the rapporteur in his report because ten years is a long time to be negotiating an agreement which, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out, is an agreement on political association, economic coordination and cooperation."
"It is clear that the European Union has not shown any lack of will;"
"I believe that one of the Member States of Mercosur has shown clear and decisive support for the multilateral round, and the Chilean and Mexican experiences - Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reminded us of this - demonstrate clearly that it is possible to go much further than the expectations established by the multilateral round."
"I therefore believe, Mr President, that where there is a will there is a way."
"Although this kind of agreement is characterised by commercial aspects, when it comes to third-generation agreements, which have contained the democratic clause, it is clear that following the Vienna Summit, following the failure of the multilateral round, we must go the whole hog."
"I believe that the European Commission must give its clear and decisive support to these association agreements, since Latin America does not need hand-outs, but opportunities, and this European Union-Mercosur Association Agreement offers an excellent opportunity for all of us to pursue our shared objectives of greater democracy, greater integration and, of course, more fluid and efficient trade, which mean peace, progress and prosperity for everybody."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on his excellent report and, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to thank him for cooperating so closely since the initial exchange of views in the Committee on International Trade."
"That cooperation has helped to produce a balanced report containing the clear message that this House wants to address to the Commission: Commissioner, we want an association agreement to be reached between the European Union and Mercosur as soon as possible for several reasons."
"Firstly, this agreement will be much more than merely a trade instrument: it will be an instrument at the service of peace, multilateralism and dialogue that will enable both blocs to adopt policies that promote shared economic, social and geopolitical values and interests."
"It will enshrine the first North-South intercontinental association, offering an alternative to other attempts at integration, such as the FTAA, which had more to do with a desire for trade domination."
"Furthermore, the European Union-Mercosur association will lead to the largest region of shared prosperity in the world, benefiting more than 700 million citizens, as previous speakers have said."
"Strengthening cooperation will make it possible to implement policies aimed at economic and social cohesion with a view to promoting development, as well as the equality and prosperity of citizens in both regions."
"For the final report, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament considers it necessary to involve social actors more in the process of integration and to have a genuine interparliamentary dimension between the European Union and Mercosur."
"We hope that the other groups will support our amendments to this effect."
"Commissioner, although efforts that come to nothing may be dispiriting, the Commission must do everything it possibly can to enable the agreement to be concluded and to put an end to the sense of stagnation and pessimism recently surrounding the multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations."
"I shall end with a question, Commissioner: could you provide us with any information regarding Venezuela's process of accession to Mercosur and tell us what effect this process is having on the negotiations underway?"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I consider it right that the European Union is striving for beneficial and close relations with the most diverse regions of the globe and, of course, with Mercosur as well."
"However, it is wrong in my view if the Commission, by means of such agreements, tries to implement through the back door that which was rejected by the majority of countries during the WTO negotiations, namely, the liberalisation of international trade between partner countries with very different economic and social conditions, without taking the different situations in these countries into account."
"The EU - Latin America summit which took place in Vienna, as well as the alternative 'Enlazando alternativas' summit of last May afforded the opportunity of being better able to understand the wishes of the new voices in Latin America and of shaping relations in the interests of the populations of both regions in a more balanced manner, and not just for the benefit of industry and commerce."
"A few days ago, the Commission published a communication on its trade policy strategy which focussed more strongly on economic liberalisation than had previously been the case."
"In yesterday's debate, Commissioner Mandelson again emphasised that he shares the same fundamental position."
"I would not like to advocate such a fundamental position."
"The report contains references which I deem to be extremely important, such as emphasising the principles of 'less than full reciprocity' and 'special and differential treatment depending on the levels of development'."
"All in all, however, the report puts forward the known liberalisation demands and even goes beyond them by approving, for instance, the area of investment as the subject of a chapter in the EU-Mercosur agreement."
"As a result of international protests, however, this has been deleted in its entirety from the Doha development round negotiations."
"My group supports a fair association agreement but not the route taken to a free trade area between the European Union and Mercosur."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Varela's report quite rightly reminds us, and he is to be congratulated for it, that Europe and Mercosur would be well advised to strengthen their cooperation."
"In recent months negotiations with Mercosur have rather come to a standstill, with most of the controversial questions waiting to be sorted out at the WTO."
"With the recent suspension of the Doha Round, we must henceforth show an unwavering political will to relaunch these discussions."
"Bilateral negotiations between regions assume a high level of economic and political integration from the two partners."
"Mercosur, however, seems weakened by the asymmetry of its members and by their sometimes divergent interests."
"Its institutions, therefore, need to be consolidated, in particular by setting up a regional parliament and a binding instrument for settling disputes."
"Furthermore, consideration needs to be given in view of Venezuela's membership which will give, without any doubt, a more political nature to the bloc and will alter the economic balance of power."
"Since it is very much in the interest of the European Union to negotiate with a strong partner, it has to support politically and financially the emergence of Mercosur as an integrated regional bloc."
"This area has the authority to reinforce alongside us the multilateral structure and the economic and social model that we hope and pray for."
"(ES) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating my fellow countryman, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on his report and on his open and positive approach, which I hope will lead to a significant consensus in this House."
"Mercosur has more than 230 million inhabitants, it is one of the five largest economic areas in the world and it is the largest in terms of food production."
"Relations between the European Union and Mercosur have deep historical roots and shared cultural foundations."
"The association agreement is therefore the best formula for extending our links and stimulating exchanges between us."
"I am pleased that our amendments have been incorporated into the report, stressing the democratic component of our relations, based on shared values, the parliamentary dimension and the active participation of civil society, aspects in connection with which I still believe we should be making additional efforts, as Mr Moreno Sánchez has pointed out."
"I am also pleased with the inclusion of our proposals on extending fisheries and tourism relations, creating appropriate regulatory frameworks, intensifying exchanges and increasing investments - with accounting and auditing standards duly harmonised - and dealing with the obstacles to rationalisation in the public sector."
"Finally, I would call upon the Commission to treat this Agreement as an objective of the highest political priority."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the House for its comments."
"I have taken careful note of them and I will convey them to my colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, for his consideration."
"For strategic and political reasons, the European Commission is totally committed to negotiating and concluding an ambitious and balanced agreement with Mercosur."
"Therefore, such an agreement remains a priority."
"Engaging in negotiations with other partners does not mean, by the way, that we are giving less priority to an agreement with Mercosur."
"The Treaty on Venezuela's accession has been signed by the Mercosur members."
"However, in order for Venezuela to be a full member, that Treaty has to be ratified by the parliaments."
"We, the Commission, do not foresee any major obstacles to the negotiation process as a result of the accession of Venezuela."
"A lot has been said here about development."
"The EU is by far the biggest donor."
"We plan to pay out about EUR 50 million for the period between 2007 and 2013."
"I believe that, for economic, cultural and political reasons, both the European Parliament and the Commission share the same view in respect of concluding an ambitious and balanced association agreement between the EU and Mercosur."
"It is a strategic objective."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Sector of berries and cherries intended for processing (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question by Mr Daul and Mr Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on the situation of the sector of soft fruits and cherries intended for processing - B6-0435/2006)."
"Mr President, we can see the growing importance of the market for fruit and vegetables."
"This is partly a result of increasing consumption, and of the interest farmers have in growing such products to improve their income."
"During the accession talks, despite the good examples of solutions for the markets for tomatoes, peaches or citrus fruit, there was lack of will on the part of the EU to positively resolve the problem of the berries market. 2004 was a difficult year for berry growers in Poland."
"I sent my first letter about this to the former Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Fischler, in July 2004."
"At the same time, the European Commission started work on simplifying the common market in fruit and vegetables in the EU, on which it reported in August 2004."
"In March 2005 the European Parliament adopted a position on this matter."
"As a result of numerous interventions and speeches by Polish MEPs to the Committee on Agriculture, we succeeded in convincing our chairman Joseph Daul to speak on this matter."
"As a result, in April and July 2005 Poland received experts' visits by representatives of the European Commission who looked into the issue of the berry and cherry market in Poland and drew up a report."
"In 2005 Polish berry growers had to deal with negative returns on produce in that market."
"In 2006 the Agricultural Commission of the European Parliament included in its programme a session in Poland, enabling MEPs to see for themselves the hardships that their Polish colleagues had been talking about."
"The Commissioner, who is not present here today, was probably already well acquainted with the problem."
"By the way, I am curious to know whether anyone in the Commission has counted how many speeches Members have made in this matter."
"During the visit to Poland, the European Commission for the first time presented a report on the situation in the berry, cherry and cherries for processing sector."
"The report is incomplete as it does not take into account the lack of horizontal integration, that is to say relations between the farmer and the processor."
"Also, it does not mention that growers are absent from the ownership structure of this industry, and that foreign capital is dominant."
"Nor does it present scenarios for the likely development of the situation on the berries market in the future."
"It is stated that all the problems of this particular Polish market have to resolve themselves."
"2006, like the two previous years, has again proved extremely difficult for soft fruit growers, and has been a crisis year."
"The Committee on Agriculture has therefore requested that action on this be speeded up and intensified, the result being today's debate and the resolution which this House will adopt in tomorrow's vote."
"We now have the final version, so let us go through it."
"MEPs appeal to the European Commission firstly to take action to improve the competitiveness of berries in the EU."
"Secondly, it should take immediate action to limit the excessive import of berries from third countries at dumping prices."
"As we know, the Anti-Dumping Committee yesterday decided to impose immediate duties on frozen strawberries exported by Chinese firms."
"The additional duties will be 0%, 12.6% or 32.4% depending on the situation."
"Thirdly, a support mechanism for grower groups should be introduced, which would give growers greater encouragement to form groups, for example, by doubling the rate of aid for groups that are formed and then recognised."
"Fourthly, other instruments should be introduced, such as a special safeguard clause, entry price mechanisms or inclusion of berries on the list of sensitive products."
"A fifth recommendation is to implement a system to support the processing of berries such as strawberries or raspberries similar to that currently used for tomatoes, peaches or citrus fruits, to stabilise the market."
"As regards the final point, I know that Commissioner Fischer-Boel, who is not present today, was rather sceptical about this, which is why it may be worth considering the introduction of a regional system of payments for growing berries for processing."
"This would be in addition to the current subsidies within the SAPS system."
"A similar solution is proposed for reforming the banana market, where there is a change in the rules for granting subsidies for products expressed in tonnes in favour of subsidies calculated by land area."
"In order to increase the competitiveness of the sector, these payments must be tied in with an obligation to join producer groups or organisations, and an obligation to sell produce within a contracting framework."
"The resolution also contains a number of other interesting measures and proposals."
"Berry growers have lost three years, and at the rate things are going with the reform of the market, it seems they will lose two more."
"It is only in April 2007 that legislative proposals for solutions in the fruit and vegetable sectors are planned to be tabled."
"Thank you for your question."
"As far as I understood, it contains six points, and I will address them one by one."
"Point one: yesterday, the Commission services presented to the Member States at the Anti-Dumping Committee a draft regulation to impose provisional additional duties on imports of frozen strawberries from China."
"The written procedure for adoption by the Commission is under way."
"Regarding the second point, the issue of the low level of organisation in new Member States will be considered in the framework of preparations for the proposal on reforming the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables."
"On point three, the Commission proposed recently to simplify state aid rules so as to facilitate crisis support."
"In particular, it is proposed that, under certain conditions, aid to compensate for bad weather would be exempted from prior authorisation by the Commission."
"Point four concerns crisis management. The issue of crisis management will be considered in Commission reform proposals for fruit and vegetables."
"Concerning point five, the Commission is not in favour of setting up EU subsidised grubbing-up programmes."
"However, Member States have the possibility to implement national programmes provided that they meet state aid rules."
"Finally, point six: promotion is indeed an important aspect."
"EU funds are available for promotion of programmes, and let me remind you that most of the above-mentioned aspects are being examined in the preparation process for the common market organisation reform proposals that the Commission will table in the near future."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) The action plan prepared by the European Commission is a good foundation, and the anti-dumping decision regarding Chinese strawberries is positive, although this is not a lasting solution."
"The only reassuring, long-term solution would be for these types of produce - cherries, sour cherries, berries, mushrooms and corn - to be included among the produce intended for processing, and therefore among those that benefit from processing subsidies within the framework of the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector."
"This would be very important especially for the new Member States, particularly since this year the producers in the new Member States are receiving only 35% of the direct payments."
"If produce in this sector is not included among those intended for processing, there will be no significant help for the new Member States."
"I have fought for this over a year and a half and will continue to do so."
"on behalf of the UEN Group - (PL) Mr President, although we have been discussing soft fruit, we have had hard-fought battles over them since the beginning of this term."
"I am very pleased that the difficult situation of soft fruit growers has met with the understanding of this House."
"As a Polish MEP I would like to thank all my colleagues for this."
"I thank you for your sympathetic approach to the issue, which above all affects farmers in my country."
"I thank you for your solidarity, particularly our colleague from the Agriculture Commission who personally came to Poland to meet farmers and see their situation on the ground."
"The draft resolution contains actions that will satisfy our farmers and bring about stabilisation of the soft fruit market, which is very important for the future of this important sector."
"Protection against excessive imports, inclusion of soft fruits on the list of sensitive items, increased aid to groups of producers and compensation for fruit not sold during the crisis are all solutions that are badly needed."
"I believe that the statements in this resolution will not remain on paper only, and that the European Commission will promptly put forward specific draft legislation."
"As co-author of the draft resolution, I ask you to vote in support of it."
"(PL) Mr President, today's debate on the situation in the berries and cherries for processing sector is the culmination of over two years of discussions of this key issue for European growers and processors."
"The lack of protection for the internal market, dumping, natural disasters, low prices, and greed and unfairness among many buyers have resulted in huge losses for fruit farmers, particularly in new Member States such as Poland, which accounts for two-thirds of the output of such produce in the EU."
"The difficult situation on the berry market has had the biggest impact on farmers in the poorest region in Europe, Lubelszczyźna, which produces one sixth of total output."
"In my parliamentary activities I have frequently raised this issue in various forms."
"I am therefore happy that today our debate will end with a concrete resolution which will allow us to repair the negotiating errors we made in Copenhagen and provide a basis for the decision which thousands of farmers are waiting for."
"I therefore thank all the Members for their cooperation and look forward to their positive support for the resolution in the vote."
"(PL) Mr President, we are debating the soft fruit sector in a situation where the European Commission has, after nearly two years of efforts on the part of many Members, decided to impose anti-dumping duties on frozen strawberries imported from China."
"This is a long-awaited decision which, one hopes, will limit the threat of growing exports of frozen strawberries from China at dumping prices."
"I would like to express the hope that the European Commission will soon also put into effect other proposals contained in the draft resolutions prepared by Mr Daul and Mr Wojciechowski such as protective clauses, entry prices, compensation for losses due to unfavourable weather conditions or a crisis on the market, and a strong support mechanism for producer groups and organisations."
"Thank you for your contributions to this debate."
"I will inform my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, about the concerns you have raised."
"All these points are being considered and discussed at length in the framework of the preparation of the forthcoming fruit and vegetables reform that is just around the corner."
"I shall do my utmost to respond to some of the issues you raised."
"Mr Tabajdi's question centred around the idea that the Commission should introduce support for producer organisations that sell soft fruit to the processing industry."
"Another point he made concerned support for producer organisations that sell soft fruit to the processing industry at a time when existing schemes are being reviewed in the context of the reform of the sector."
"The Commission considers that the introduction of such a support scheme would be inadequate from a technical point of view."
"It would also be untimely and would not be in line with the principles behind CAP reform."
"'The Commission should devise and implement measures restricting excessive imports of soft fruit, in particular those which apply dumping prices'."
"It is true that some of the difficulties faced in the sector of strawberries for processing originate from low-priced imports of frozen strawberries from third countries."
"Yesterday, the Commission presented to the Member States and the Anti-Dumping and Anti-Subsidy Committee a proposal to impose provisional anti-dumping measures on imports of frozen strawberries from China."
"The procedure for adoption by the Commission is under way."
"In the other subsectors, imports from third countries either play a marginal role - for example as regards blackcurrants and sour cherries - or have decreased in the last years - as is the case with raspberries, for example."
"In the case of frozen raspberries, Poland has increased its market share in the last few years, at the expense of imports from third countries."
"Mr Siekierski, you were asking about support schemes for grouping producers: these exist both in the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables and in rural development legislation."
"In its report on the situation in the sector of soft fruits and cherries, the Commission has indicated that, in the framework of the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, the Commission may propose specific additional support for Member States with low levels of organisation, and this is being looked at in the context of the preparation of the reform."
"Mr Siekierski, Mr Wojciechowski and others want to include soft fruits on the list of sensitive goods and bring them under the special safeguards clause and the entry price system."
"The special safeguards clause was introduced in the Uruguay Round for products that had tariffs."
"In the case of fruit and vegetables, this concerned products under the reference price system."
"It is no longer possible to increase the list of products covered by the special safeguards."
"Similarly, the entry price system applies to products that were previously covered by the reference price system."
"There is no possibility of including soft fruits under the entry price system."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your information."
"Cherries are my favourite fruit also, so I can sleep more easily."
"I hope that that goes for other Members also."
"I have received a motion for a resolution) tabled in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."

"European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - Fundamental Rights Agency: activities under Title VI of the EU Treaty (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Mrs Kinga Gál, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - C6-0288/2005 -"
"and"
"by Mrs Magda Kósáné Kovács, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision empowering the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to pursue its activities in areas referred to in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union - C6-0289/2005 -."
"Mr President, I believe that today marks an important stage in the assessment of a provision that is highly important both for the Commission and for Parliament."
"The initiative in question, which, first of all, was adopted in accordance with the formal rules of a procedure that excludes codecision, has subsequently been carried forward politically through an extremely close collaboration with Parliament."
"The trialogue method, which has enabled us to come to an agreement on many occasions, is, in fact, a political solution: even though, from an institutional and legal point of view, we are sadly not in the presence of a formal codecision procedure, this political solution has enabled us thus far to develop an excellent working relationship."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Gál and Mrs Kósáné Kovács, for their useful collaboration."
"We have come to an agreement on many points, and I hope, too, that the few outstanding points can also be resolved by the end of the year so that, in 2007 - as has often been repeated by the European Council and Parliament, and as the Commission itself hopes - the Fundamental Rights Agency will at last become operational."
"What points still need to be considered and developed further, even after the last trialogue, which was nonetheless extremely useful?"
"There are three basic issues, which were among the items I recently addressed with the Ministers of Home Affairs at the Council meeting held last week in Luxembourg, and recently in a meeting with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe."
"The first issue specifically concerns the relations between the future agency and the Council of Europe."
"The Commission, myself and - I am sure - the European Parliament itself intend to prevent any overlapping of powers between the future agency and the Council of Europe, which already does a fine job of protecting and promoting fundamental rights."
"I believe that it is possible to pursue the common objective of establishing a working relationship between the agency, on the one hand, and the Council of Europe, on the other, with each one working within its own areas of responsibility."
"The agency's primary task is to oversee, monitor and gather together material regarding compliance with Community legislation, without going beyond this remit."
"The first point is therefore one of ensuring that the Council of Europe's powers are respected in full and that there is a willingness to cooperate."
"The second point relates to the geographical scope of the Agency's powers and responsibilities."
"You will all recall that the original position limited the geographical scope solely to the EU Member States."
"Obviously, the need soon arose to extend the scope of the responsibilities to candidate countries, countries that are already, albeit to varying degrees, on course to join the European Union."
"There was also the serious problem of countries at the pre-accession stage, which we call potential candidate countries."
"This is an extremely important concept, because it refers to a key geographical area for Europe: the Western Balkans."
"These are countries that are negotiating, in some cases, or applying, in others, stabilisation and association agreements with the European Union, which involve among other things extremely sensitive material relating to the protection of fundamental rights."
"Hence the proposal, which is supported by the Council and contained within the text being examined today, to extend the scope of application to these countries."
"Some Member States have expressed reservations in this regard, and the Council of Europe has voiced strong concerns, which it is my duty to report."
"I believe, however, that it is possible to find a satisfactory compromise solution, which in no way rules out the prospect that these countries might also fall within the competence of the agency."
"Such a compromise solution would take account even of the fact that the agency in question, which will already be responsible for all of the current powers of the Vienna Centre - so, racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism - in addition to new powers, could best focus on the Member States of the European Union and on the candidate countries, at least to begin with."
"It is therefore advisable not to rule out the possibility that pre-accession countries might perhaps be taken into consideration, but account must be taken of the demands made, on the one side, by the Council of Europe, and, on the other, by some influential Member States that formally raised this issue at the Council meeting in Luxembourg."
"This is a point on which there is still room for reflection."
"The third and final point relates to the inclusion of the so-called 'third pillar' topics: police and judicial cooperation."
"From the outset, the Commission - and I myself - have been in favour of the strategy - which this Parliament also considers to be the best - of including this topic in the remit of the agency in question."
"In my view, it would be rather difficult to have to explain to the people of Europe that we are close to establishing an agency with responsibility for promoting and protecting fundamental rights, and exclude from the scope of those powers the aspects of police cooperation and judicial activity, in relation to which there is an objective need to ensure that the fundamental rights of persons accused or on trial, for example, are respected in full."
"There is also, as you know, a problem of the legal basis, which I will obviously not focus on now, but there is a political reason for it."
"If this agency is to be of use to the citizens, then it somehow must include topics that come under the 'third pillar'."
"It is up to us to find an acceptable solution, but I do not believe that it should involve postponing the decision on whether to include the 'third pillar' topics until after the agency has been established."
"Postponing the decision would mean not making any decision at all, and I believe that that would be a mistake."
"As you know, within the Council, some large EU countries are demonstrating a certain reluctance to accept this inclusion, alleging internal constitutional problems."
"Personally, I believe that these problems can be overcome and that, precisely on this issue, Parliament can play a very important political role."
"To conclude, I hope that, thanks to a compromise solution, the Council will accept a text which, even though it has not been formally codecided, may represent the joint efforts of Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"This could perhaps be the first case, ladies and gentlemen, in which a shared political will has led us to waive rules that do not admit of the formal codecision procedure, and we have in fact reached a joint decision by political means."
"Aside from the agency, which will undoubtedly have a more solid foundation on which to develop if it has this result behind it, what we are discussing here might also serve as a good example for many other sectors to which the codecision procedure has unfortunately not yet been applied."
"rapporteur. - (HU) I feel honoured to have been a participant in this process which proves - as Mr Frattini has just said in concluding his speech - that, beyond the formalities, it is possible to cooperate productively if there is a common will."
"The creation of the Agency for Fundamental Rights is surrounded by numerous debates."
"The adoption of this report is the result of a long series of arduous discussions."
"Special thanks are due to Commissioner Frattini, to the Austrian Presidency and to the approach taken by the Finnish Presidency."
"Throughout this process, Parliament has steadfastly taken the stand that it is necessary to transform the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to extend its remit to the totality of fundamental rights."
"We need to be vigilant in this area, as is all the more evident from events contravening fundamental rights within new Member States."
"Furthermore, we will need objective information from reliable governmental and non-governmental sources, research centres and various segments of civil society - such as religious organisations - and we must work closely together in defence of our fundamental rights."
"The intention to create this agency has provoked and is still provoking debate in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"Honouring the work of the Council of Europe and recognising its necessity and importance, the text that is soon to be voted on has taken into account the remarks of that body to the effect that the Agency should in no way duplicate the work already carried out by the Council of Europe."
"Rather, its structure and network should assist the Council of Europe, and above all, to the decision-making forums in Europe: the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"The text being proposed for adoption is an acceptable compromise."
"At the same time, Parliament has maintained its original position as long as there is no agreement within the Council on an essential point."
"For it is clear to us that if we want to create an effective organisation instead of a mere showcase - which would be a waste of money, and in that respect I agree with those who would not lend their support to a useless organisation - it is obvious that its scope has to be extended to obtaining information, collecting data and reporting on questions falling under the third pillar."
"As we see day after day, it is precisely in matters relating to police and judicial cooperation that the most worrisome issues arise."
"Let me point to the specific problems of the trafficking of children and women, for instance."
"Therefore, we are looking forward to an acceptable compromise with the Council."
"It is for this reason that we are postponing the final vote and referring the report back to the Commission, in the hope that the Council will take seriously its own decision regarding the 1 January 2007 date."
"By voting for the compromise amendments, for the compromise wording that we have negotiated during this long process, Parliament wishes to send an emphatic message regarding the importance of all that is contained in the text, and also to remind the Council that what happens next is now up to them."
"The text to be voted on retains references to the Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as to Article 7 of the Treaty, since Parliament can only become involved in the creation of an agency that is a vital and effective body and that can become part of the solution in Europe."
"New problems are constantly arising with respect to our fundamental rights that require attention and remedies."
"Let us help bring forward the solution with our votes, and let us indicate clearly what the European public opinion expects from us: the creation of an effective, independent, yet accountable organisation."
"Thank you for your help and support."
"The Council decision asking and authorising the Commission to submit a proposal for the creation of a Fundamental Rights Agency has now grown out of its infancy."
"Three years have passed, yet we still have the impression that there is no consensus among Member States on certain basic questions."
"The process of harmonisation between the three institutions was a very important, happy and instructive experience for us."
"It revealed that Parliament, the Commission and the representatives of the current Presidency were able to come to an agreement on the most important questions, although no such agreement has been reached yet among the full membership of the Council."
"This efficient harmonisation, even if it concerns the future, as it were, gives me a great deal of confidence and optimism."
"In the preparatory work, we agreed on the most important requirements."
"I would like to evoke simply the keywords here: we all want this institution to be independent, accountable and endowed with efficient organisation, and its work to be transparent, so that it will increase citizens' trust in the work of the European institutions."
"We have also accepted the outlines of its scope, since - as pointed out by Mrs Gál - we all maintain that the focus of the Agency should, first of all, be on the Member States and their institutions."
"The Agency should have the ability to express its opinion on European legislation concerning fundamental rights, with the competence as well to monitor third countries within a certain limited geographical area, since we did not wish to deprive the agency of its main area of concern, the European Community."
"My task was to put forward a draft Council Resolution to Parliament, which has provoked extensive debate because there was and still is no complete agreement on whether or not the agency should have competence beyond the first pillar."
"I have to inform my fellow Members that in our original conception we endorsed extending the Agency's competence to monitoring organisations belonging to the second pillar."
"As there did not seem to be any chance of consensus in this regard, I withdrew these proposals, as rapporteur, before the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Many of us are of the opinion, however, that it would diminish the importance of the Agency if we renounced broadening its scope to include the third pillar."
"For that reason, we stand firm in our resolve even though we never did nor do we now reject the idea of compromise, the idea of mutual compromise."
"Therefore, I wish to express my thanks to the Austrian and the Finnish Presidencies, but above all to Vice-President Frattini whose dedication and effectiveness helped us reach the eventual solution."
"I wish to ask my fellow Members to support the proposals presented by the Committee on Civil Liberties together with the amendments therein."
"Afterwards, we will hand back the competence to the Commission, because it is up to the Commission to submit proposals to the Council, where we hope they will receive the necessary support."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, let me remind the House that the origins of today's debate can be traced back to a Council decision of December 2004."
"It is because of that that we are discussing the Agency for Fundamental Rights today, so the Council cannot slink out of the back door to escape a debate on the subject, acting all the while as if Members of this House had gone mad with desire for European bureaucracy and as if this had nothing do with what matters to the people of the European Union."
"It also needs to be stressed that the Fundamental Rights Agency is something about which Parliament is engaged in talks with both the Commission and the Council, and in these we have endeavoured to get the agency a clearly delineated mandate."
"I would like again to highlight what this is all about."
"Nobody here in this House wants to see operational structures duplicated, and we have all reached a compromise to the effect that the agency's mandate should require it to concentrate on the protection of fundamental rights in the Member States, in candidate countries, and, finally, in countries with which we have stabilisation and association agreements. Appropriate arrangements have been made for consultation with the Member States."
"What I would like again to make clear is that the draft we have produced takes proper account of the interests of the Council of Europe."
"I would like, finally, to avail myself of this opportunity to thank Mrs Gál and Mrs Kovács once more for the work they have done."
"Now it is the Council's turn to do something."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which always means that one has to concentrate more on money than on what a report is actually about, and so that - rather than the report's subject-matter, about which Members have already said everything that needs to be said - is what my opinion is about."
"We do indeed have a problem with the funding for the European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights, which will be a whole new agency, similar to the Chemicals Agency or the Institute for Gender Equality, and will be in place from 2007 onwards, provided that it is agreed to by the time we assume it will be."
"Now we all know that the Council and Parliament agreed, in paragraph 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May of this year and relating to budgetary discipline and sound financial management agreed by them and the Commission, that the Council and Parliament would be required to discuss the funding arrangements of the new agencies and then come to an agreement on them."
"As long ago as this July, before the summer recess, the Budget Committee invited the Council to enter negotiations with us - we did so, indeed, on repeated occasions."
"Since the Council has not, as yet, responded to our invitation, the Committee on Budgets has now, in the course of its deliberations on the coming financial year, renamed the budget line to which the Commission had appended the description 'Human Rights Agency' as the budget line for the 'European Union's Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia' and created a new one with the annotation 'for information'."
"We hope that we will soon have a legal basis and will then be able to come to an agreement with the Council as to how the new agency should be funded."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, further to what Mrs Haug has said, perhaps I might, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, make a number of fundamental observations relating to the agencies."
"This House has spent years fighting against bureaucracy, duplication of structures and excessive bureaucracy, and, although it has always been right to do so, its efforts have met with only partial success."
"At the same time, though, the creation of new agencies is repeatedly endorsed, not only by this House, but also, and predominantly, by the Council."
"Demands are also made for new monitoring bodies and machinery, with consequences that are obvious when we take a look at the Court of Auditors' report."
"We now have sixteen agencies."
"I do not know whether you are familiar with all of them and know where they are to be found, but they now employ over 2 300 people, and, if you tot up the costs, you will see that these are probably now about to go over the billion mark."
"We are talking about EUR 1 000 million here, and when you see 60% or 70% of that going on the administration of these agencies alone, you will quite rightly ask yourself how much sense it makes to have these agencies, and you will be all the more likely to ask questions when you become aware that some of the work is done either in the Commission, the European Council, or, indeed, in Parliament and that these three institutions could well make a better and more efficient job of it."
"That is the problem that we face."
"We know that there are, inevitably, administrative costs associated with the agencies, and that these are increasing dramatically;"
"I have myself taken a look at the figures, which show an annual increase between 10% and 20% in personnel costs, which, in some agencies, runs to between 80% and 100%, but the question arises of who checks to see what services these agencies actually perform, in what way they benefit the public in the European Union, or what value they add."
"It may well be that some of them - perhaps even many of them - are superfluous."
"We should be so bold as to look to see how the various functions can be better shared around and in which instances others could do the jobs better."
"What I am calling for is a pause for reflection and a review of the existing 16 agencies in terms of their performance and added value; I am also asking that consideration be given to closing down any agencies that have become surplus to requirements and no longer do anything useful, rather than constantly speculating about where we can open new ones."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the way in which he has worked so cooperatively with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this."
"From Mr Pirker's contribution, you will see that Mrs Gál has had to do an enormous amount of work in her own Group and I congratulate her on the work she has done to bring people together."
"Let me just say to Mr Pirker that we have an expression in the United Kingdom that you put your money where your mouth is."
"The easiest thing in the world is to say that you are 'concerned' or you are 'committed'; it is much harder to follow it through and give the resources in order to achieve the outcome that we all hope for."
"We often say 'red tape' when what we mean is that we do not want to stop people from doing something that they should not."
"In this case, when it comes to empowering human rights' defenders, red tape is absolutely necessary and, I would say, brilliant."
"When it comes to cost, if, again, we say we value something and we put no resources behind it, we expose our hypocrisy."
"So that is why I ask Mrs Gál to continue her excellent work."
"I believe we will reach a compromise with the Council, because the Commission has shown that it is willing to try to initiate that compromise."
"Let me also say to the Council of Europe that, although I fully understand its concerns, you cannot have too many human rights' defenders in the field of defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"With this agency we are not replicating what the Council of Europe does; we also have obligations in the Union, specifically under the Treaties: the Treaty on European Union and, of course, the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We have seen in very recent months and, indeed, over the last year, worrying hate-speak used by politicians in certain parts of the Union."
"We have seen a rise not only in hate-speak but also in racist, xenophobic and homophobic violence, and the Council has done nothing when it comes to Articles 6 and 7."
"In the absence of action by the Council, is it any wonder that we need an agency that will monitor, report and bring forward recommendations and thereby hold every single Member State to its international obligations?"
"It makes sense."
"Finally, let me say this: if we see one individual attacked because of religion, sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, whatever, and we stand back and do nothing then we create the conditions that brought about the Second World War."
"This institution in particular was built out of the ashes of the Second World War with a commitment that we would never turn our eyes or ourselves away from the appalling violence that man commits upon man."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am delighted to congratulate Parliament's two rapporteurs, Mrs Gál and Mrs Kósáné Kovács, for the excellent work that they have done, and also to congratulate Commissioner Frattini for the forceful way in which he has supported this exercise."
"Having been not so happy with him in a debate yesterday on PNR, I am very happy with him now."
"I would also like to have addressed my thanks to the Council, but of course they are not here."
"This Fundamental Rights Agency is not just another European body."
"I believe that it will help reassure EU citizens that human rights are being upheld by the 'Brussels bureaucrats' and by EU governments when they are implementing European law."
"It will thus increase confidence in the European Union, and I think it is therefore a very appropriate 50th birthday present for the European Union to give itself in the run-up to March 2007."
"I hope it will also help stop 'gold-plating' of EU directives, which some governments are rather prone to."
"They take a European law and when they transpose it into national law, they add things which have been sitting in a drawer in a ministry."
"Hopefully, we might see some curbing of that."
"But it is also essential to include matters of justice, security and policing, since, by their nature, police, judicial cooperation and criminal law measures, however desirable, are the most likely to raise concerns about human rights."
"For instance, we have the European arrest warrant but we still do not have the accompanying procedural guarantees for people facing charge and trial, which have long been promised."
"I do not believe that this undermines the Council of Europe, and I fully agree with Michael Cashman on this: it intensifies the support for human rights in Europe, but we also need to include competence in relation to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty."
"We have to intensify the peer review and monitoring function for human rights within the European Union if we are to increase mutual trust and, therefore, provide a basis for mutual recognition of judicial decisions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to extend my group's thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Kovács and Mrs Gál, and I do not do so as a formality, but because both rapporteurs have had a very laborious task to perform and have set out, on this House's behalf, a strong and convincing position, one that is backed by a large majority and will, it is to be hoped, also impress the Council."
"This House has always seen itself as an advocate for fundamental rights, and that is, indeed, what it is supposed to be."
"Being an advocate of fundamental rights comes naturally to a body elected directly by the people to represent them, and I find it regrettable that the Council took no account of this when considering the codecision issue and thereby rendered the whole debate defective."
"If you want to see whether politicians really want to accomplish something and what goals they most deeply want to achieve, then take a look at the instruments with which they equip themselves in order to get their way."
"Mr Pirker has just been reminding us of the bureaucracy at the European level."
"The instruments for monetary policy, the single market, and the stability pact are hard-edged laws, with money in abundance, sanctions, binding deadlines, monitoring bodies and much, much more."
"I have never yet heard Mr Pirker sounding off about the means available for enforcing financial and budgetary policy, about its monitoring and control instruments, the full disclosure of national data, its sanctions machinery, the powers given to the law courts - everything that one might wish for in order for that policy's definite objectives to be achieved."
"When it comes to democracy, though, when it comes to fundamental human rights, we have to make do with soft agreements and arrangements, with a bundle of affirmations lacking in any sanction, guarantee or monitoring mechanism."
"That is one of the causes of the crisis of confidence in Europe."
"The economic objectives are pursued with the utmost rigour, while the interests of people are a fit subject for pious utterances or, again, of affirmations."
"All this is happening against the backdrop of a grave situation."
"Even though many years have passed, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has still not yet entered into force or become legally binding."
"The issues surrounding the CIA's prisons, the transfer of data, the slow pace of investigations and the governments' foot-dragging cooperation have dealt public confidence a blow from which it will take a long time to recover."
"In our attempts at combating terrorism we are becoming less and less able to balance freedom and security, and the public can feel this."
"One consequence of the temporary failure of the European Constitution has been that intergovernmental cooperation has remained what it was before, namely the black hole of European democracy."
"The government of one Member State - I refer to Poland - is openly considering the introduction of the death penalty."
"The British Home Secretary stood at the lectern in this House and called for a more lenient approach to the ban on torture when terrorists are involved."
"Even today, there is no early warning system attached to Articles 6 and 7."
"On the contrary, Mr Pirker, it is an unfortunate fact that the instruments for enforcing and guaranteeing fundamental rights are not equal in status to the instruments that are in place to get economic and monetary policy implemented."
"We have a vitally important task to perform here, and, as we see it, one reason why it is important is that fundamental rights are indivisible."
"At the heart of this House's demands, of course, is that governments should cooperate with each other on this."
"The second, and, in particular, the third pillar, must be fully within the Agency's remit, for if they are not, it will become clear to the people that, where fundamental rights - the most vulnerable area of policy - are concerned, the governments are not taking citizens' rights as seriously as they ought to."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is right to extend the powers and activities of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"The data collected over the last few years are worrying: it transpires from the Centre's annual reports that there has been an increase in drug-related developments."
"The establishment of the agency in question can therefore help not only to monitor these serious developments but also to vigorously combat them."
"It is strange that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as represented by Mr Pirker, is worried about bureaucracy and the rise in costs when we are concerned here with defending fundamental rights."
"The value of human rights cannot be quantified economically."
"The protection of fundamental rights is an aspect of our identity, and is perhaps the only way to make Europe strong."
"I expected an attack - which has not materialised - on the agencies, including Frontex, an agency that has not performed any duties this year, nor helped to improve the lives of EU citizens."
"I believe, instead, that we must strongly defend the activities and the future of the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"The problem of duplication does not exist, and even if we were to create some, I would not be worried, because I firmly believe that it can only help to improve the lives of European citizens if there are more agencies, more structures and more institutions that are responsible for protecting human rights."
"I am concerned about the Council's absence: only yesterday, the minister left the House and, today, an important debate is taking place."
"However, I believe that, during a debate such as this, in which two opposing positions - our Parliament's and the Council's - are up against each other, it would have been helpful if Council representatives had at least been present in this House."
"I believe that granting Parliament a powerful role in the establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency is a positive step, just as I believe that the work of Mrs Gál, Mrs Kósáné Kovács and Mr Frattini, who has reaffirmed his favourable position in this House, is important."
"However, we must also ensure that there is strong involvement on the part of NGOs and European civil society."
"Mr President, in its time, the ideology of human rights played an important role in undermining the destructive forces of totalitarianism."
"However, this ideology is now starting to mutate, or has mutated, into a caricature of its former self."
"The right of everyone to everything, rights instead of duties, the replacement of rights by privileges - these are the bounds of absurdity towards which we are moving."
"How high minded it sounds - a Fundamental Rights Agency."
"But what form will this Agency take and what will it do?"
"The grounds for the application to establish the Agency state that it needs to be given broader authority to enable it to implement the aims of the EU, a common foreign policy included."
"However, expanding the authority of EU institutions is a threat to the principle of sovereignty and subsidiarity."
"It threatens, for example, the implementation of such curious acts as the most recent European Parliament resolution on xenophobia."
"The problem lies in how the Agency should exercise its authority."
"Will it address genuine threats to human rights, or will it simply pillory governments that have fallen out of favour with the EU majority for one reason or another?"
"Alternatively, it might devote itself to promoting privileges for certain minorities, or absurdly vague concepts such as gender equality in all areas, an issue which I have raised in this House on previous occasions."
"It has been suggested that the institution of the Fundamental Rights Forum be deleted from the proposal for the Agency."
"Such a Forum was to include representatives of social, professional and ecclesiastical organisations, and also of religious and philosophical organisations."
"There is now only a vague promise of their involvement in the Agency."
"This means that everything will be decided by officials and politicians who will arrive at decisions by voting."
"The decisions will obviously be neutral ones."
"But how will this neutrality work out in practice?"
"Let us take a recent example."
"The European Union is contributing to the UN Population Fund, which for its part assists the practice of forced abortion in developing countries."
"Amendments tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations were returned again during this year's budget debate."
"We demanded that the EU should not assist programmes which promote forced abortion."
"This derives from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the provisions of the 1994 Cairo conference."
"The issue is, incidentally, totally separate from the debate on the legality or otherwise of abortion."
"It addresses freedom of choice, a fundamental human right, and one which the majority of this House supposedly acknowledges."
"However, the majority of members of the Committee on Budgets rejected these three amendments, thereby supporting coercion and rejecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights where third countries are concerned."
"Whilst full of platitudes about the rights of various minorities, the majority of MEPs are of the opinion that we can use common European funds to finance activities such as forced abortion in China, where women whose pregnancies are at variance with government quotas are dragged out of their homes and forced to have abortions against their will, even in the ninth month of pregnancy."
"A year ago the Western press reported a series of drastic examples of such actions, but where were the advocates of women's rights and the human rights then?"
"It is not even a question of defending unborn life, it is a question of respecting fundamental human rights."
"Those who advocate abortion claim that the foetus is part of a woman's body."
"I would suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that if it were a matter of forced amputation of a hand or a foot, the alarm would most certainly be raised."
"Yet a foetus is not even part of the body."
"It is essentially different."
"Whilst some regard it as a living being, others regard it as being of less value than any part of the human body."
"If the European Union ignores the rights of women outside its borders to have children, how can it defend human rights within its borders?"
"This is hypocrisy on a colossal scale."
"Nice work: liberal democracy supporting coercion!"
"After this most recent experience I have considerable doubts as to whether the proposed Fundamental Rights Agency will not become just another instrument for political manoeuvring, in which common sense would always be outvoted."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the European Fundamental Rights Agency is politically controversial - so much so that a Member State is considering vetoing it."
"The Council of Europe's Assembly also has major objections to it, and, last week, its chairman called for the proposal to be reviewed."
"There are two major arguments that speak out against the establishment of a Fundamental Rights Agency, and it is unfortunate that the compromise struck by Mrs Gál does not do enough to refute them."
"To me, that is sufficient reason for submitting an amendment to reject the proposal that we are to vote on today."
"The proposed agency will unnecessarily duplicate the activities of the Council of Europe, the Human Rights Court and the OSCE."
"In addition, it draws an unwelcome distinction between the 25 EU Member States and the other 21 European countries."
"Secondly, the Fundamental Rights Agency stands in the way of a good relationship with our neighbouring countries on this matter."
"Indeed, talks and continuous dialogue between the European Union and third countries are held in the framework of international relations, and that involves the discussion of topics other than critical views of fundamental rights."
"Very recently, the Dutch Senate unanimously prohibited the government from voting in favour of this proposal."
"Since a Dutch veto can be averted only if the aforementioned points of criticism are taken on board, it is likely that the vote will be postponed."
"(NL) Mr President, quite a few people are wishing the Fundamental Rights Agency much success, and, in view of recent events, it will need it."
"I reckon the agency will have enough on its plate just upholding the freedom of expression."
"Yesterday, this House expressed its indignation at what is happening in Russia, which is wholly justified, except that it is not only in Russia that freedom of expression needs to be upheld."
"Allow me to give you a few examples."
"In my own country, the trade unions announced yesterday that they will track down all members who stood for my party, the Vlaams Belang, during the recent elections, with a view to kicking them out."
"That is tantamount to a Berufsverbot in the heart of the Union."
"In France, Dr Redeker, a professor of philosophy, had to go into hiding following death threats, because the oh-so-tolerant Islam does not tolerate criticism of its holy Koran."
"France is being threatened with an economic boycott from Ankara and the Turkish Government, because Charles Aznavour and President Chirac have been in Yerevan demanding that Turkey should acknowledge the Armenian genocide - something that is not to the so-called model candidate country's liking."
"Indeed, there is a great deal yet to be done by this agency, and not just in Russia."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Gál on her hard work, but I am afraid that I also have to strike a rather discordant note in these discussions."
"As a former member of the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I obviously have no problem with the development of human rights, but I have a problem with this proposal."
"I think this agency is unnecessary; if its powers were to be effective they could only be delivered either under a European constitution, which certainly is not imminent now, or some other legal treaty base, which it certainly will not have."
"The Charter has always been contradictory, in my view, to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights, which also covers many countries outside the EU."
"The articles are very different in each case."
"Whatever anyone says, a new proliferation of European agencies and their functions will cause not only an overlap but also an unnecessary increase in bureaucracy."
"It will, of course, be expensive, and I would remind Mr Cashman, who says 'put your money where your mouth is', that this is not my money or his money - it is the money of the European citizens, and we have an obligation to be very careful indeed about how we spend their money when we take initiatives of this kind."
"The current body on which, if it goes ahead, this will be built - the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia - has not actually shown itself to be that objective or that positive in its work."
"I have raised in this House on a number of occasions the issue in 2003 of the suppression of the anti-Semitism report."
"There was a lot of discussion about that, and it clearly showed that there was not the objectivity needed when looking at human or fundamental rights, but a rather subjective approach by a number of officials."
"I do not want to end up in a situation where we have not only conflict between two agencies - one of the Council of Europe and one of our own - but also a lack of objectivity in the handling of cases which, undoubtedly, are always going to be sensitive."
"I think we have to be very careful."
"We can certainly have our dreams and hopes for the improvement of human rights, not only in the European Union but particularly in those states, such as Russia and elsewhere, where they are clearly now being ignored."
"However, it is important that we do not increase the number of agencies merely for the sake of it on a political basis."
"We should look at our existing agencies and our powers of persuasion at the highest level and use them to the full before we take this new adventure."
"(FR) Mr President, first of all, by way of introduction to my remarks, I would like to know whether Mr Pirker was speaking for his group or on his own behalf."
"Having heard what Mr Kirkhope had to say, I no longer know."
"The first speaker, Mr Pirker, was supposed to be giving the opinion of his group."
"After listening to him, I certainly wonder whether the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports its own rapporteur, Mrs Gál, or not."
"It is no longer very clear where we stand today."
"Yet in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we seemed to be in agreement; at least that is what our votes indicate."
"I must admit that we are somewhat flummoxed by the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats today, which does not match up in any way at all with the debate we conducted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"What purpose, then, is served by debates in committee?"
"As far as our group is concerned, we have been consistent."
"I would like to thank Mrs Gál and Mrs Kósáné Kovács for their excellent proposals and for their efforts that have culminated in a universally acceptable compromise."
"We welcome this proposal from the Commission for a broadening of the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, making it into a European Union Agency on Fundamental Rights, because the European Union must show an example and guarantee better protection of the fundamental rights of its citizens."
"The prime responsibility of such an agency - and I am sorry to see that some of the previous speakers have now left - must be to protect fundamental rights in the Member States as a matter of priority."
"That would not prevent it from looking elsewhere, but its first priority must be the Member States - let us put our own house in order."
"Over the past few years, we have seen a rise in extremism in Europe, an increase in outpourings of poisonous invective."
"We must be vigilant in defending the rights of everyone, a vigilance that must even extend into the confines of our own Parliament."
"We must keep watch for racist and xenophobic attacks."
"The peace of our societies is at risk unless we can inculcate respect for our differences and acceptance of diversity."
"The agency will have to ensure that the relevant European legislation is effectively transposed into the national law of the Member States and that it is properly applied."
"It will guarantee that the legislation of every Member State accords with our European principles."
"We certainly have a very comprehensive body of anti-discrimination law, and we are all well aware that it has been very poorly transposed in the Member States."
"The agency would be able to raise problems and provide advice on the best ways of implementing this legislation."
"It would be competent to deal with all areas covered by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, even though it is true that the Charter is not yet actionable."
"Our Parliament was one of the initiators of the Charter - that is worth remembering - and the Charter should be placed at the heart of the European integration process."
"If the agency were to have no powers under the third pillar, it would offer little more than the present Observatory."
"We agree on that point."
"In fact, the activities of the police and judiciary are at the heart of efforts to protect fundamental rights."
"It is therefore essential that the agency should have powers in this domain; that is one of the priorities to which I believed that the whole of this Parliament subscribed."
"It is worth recalling that this proposal from the Commission is the result of repeated calls from the Council for the creation of such an agency."
"In December 2003, for example, the European Council suggested that the mandate of the Vienna Observatory be broadened, and that wish was enshrined in the Hague Programme."
"In short, we surely ought to know what we want."
"Accordingly, we are backing these reports in their entirety, and we call on the Council to take heed of the position on this matter that was formulated in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and is endorsed by a large majority of Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, let me make it perfectly clear, for Mrs Roure's benefit, that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats certainly does value and endorse the work Mrs Gál has done, and she is well aware of that fact, so nothing has changed in that respect."
"We have an equally high regard for the work the Commissioner is doing, but, as I said at the very outset, we do have to do some fundamental and general thinking about agencies."
"We see human rights as indivisible; compliance with them is not merely optional."
"In my view, it goes without saying that they must be complied with within the European Union and in the states that are set to accede to it."
"That is why some fundamental thinking about agencies and the shape they take is to be recommended."
"I am right behind Mrs Gál and the Commissioner, but all my other remarks still stand - and underlined several times over."
"- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has always reacted appropriately to violations of human rights."
"I have spoken about this here more than once, particularly in respect of violations of human rights in the republics of Central Asia."
"However, we are not used to talking about human rights, their protection and violations in the Community."
"Perhaps we believe that we do not have this problem, or that it is of little importance."
"I would like to offer a real life example."
"In 2005, the following violations of human rights were reported: disregard of the right to privacy, especially when listening to private conversations or publicising pre-trial investigation material; the intrusion of politics into the work of law enforcement and the courts; lack of independence in pre-trial investigations and prosecution; violation of the right to a fair trial; the inhuman and brutal behaviour of police officers; discrimination, racism, trafficking in women, and so on."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you probably think that I am referring to the republics of Central Asia again."
"Sadly, all this is happening in my own country - Lithuania."
"This was stated by the Lithuanian Humans Rights Monitoring Institute and even acknowledged by the President of the Republic of Lithuania."
"The press tell us that the development of democracy has stopped in the ten new Member States."
"I agree with this statement and believe this is due to the fact that the pre-accession pressure has disappeared."
"Therefore, I believe that the new agency may help us move forward; however, its current powers are insufficient."
"The agency would need considerably stronger powers in order to become an effective instrument in monitoring and ensuring the rights of citizens."
"After all, ensuring democracy and human rights is our duty and the reason the people of the Community elected us."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I support the excellent work done, and I wish to thank Mrs Gál and Mrs Kósáné Kovács for it."
"I think a Fundamental Rights Agency is very important for the European Union in order to protect, and ensure respect for, these rights throughout the Union."
"I would like to mention one aspect of fundamental rights: rights relating to language and to culture."
"These are not clearly protected in many European states, nor are they in some states which are candidates for accession."
"This Agency could be a very good instrument to stress this point and to ensure that the rights of stateless citizens or of citizens belonging to a minority within a state are respected."
"The Universal Declaration on Linguistic Rights, made in Barcelona in 1996, is a good document to take into account, and I believe we are working in the right direction."
"I hope for a majority vote from this Parliament."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mrs Juknevičienė."
"We often speak in this Chamber about upholding human rights in third countries, yet rarely do we have the opportunity to strengthen the protection of human rights right here in our Member States."
"The establishment of the Human Rights Agency is, to my mind, a definite step in the right direction."
"Our citizens certainly have the right to factual, comparable and objective information on respect for human rights both in their own Member State and throughout Europe."
"Although I am very much in favour of the establishment of this agency, I should like, if I may, to ask some fundamental questions, however."
"Firstly, as a former member of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, for whose work I have great admiration, I should like to ask how, in practice, this cooperation with the agency will be delivered, in such a way that it will lead not to a duplication of activities, but rather to activities that complement each other."
"Secondly, in view of the fact that, as far as this proposal is concerned, the agency is to be geared towards targets and assessments, I should like to ask how, when these areas of interest are being determined, it can be ensured that some Member States will not overlook politically awkward issues."
"Thirdly, I should like to stress that most of the budget, two thirds of it at least, should be earmarked for programmes and not for administrative or personnel requirements."
"(PL) Mr President, it seems there is to be yet another agency."
"Parkinson's law rides again."
"Anyone who believes that it will be possible for a group of highly paid bureaucrats to improve human rights on the ground by administrative measures is rather naïve, to say the least."
"I do not want to use stronger words."
"Increasing the number of bodies in the area of political do-gooding while these same political groups and this same Parliament are stifling the economic freedom which could earn the money for a real improvement in the living standards of the peoples of Europe is a misjudgement and a classic political faux pas."
"That is why I would today ask the House to consider who it is that will ensure the impartiality of an Agency employing hundreds of highly paid bureaucrats subject to practically no control over their activities. These people could use the Agency as a political weapon to fight undesirable individuals or political opponents, or to attack awkward governments who do not conform with so-called political correctness."
"I believe this action is unconstitutional in at least some Member States."
"It implements the principles of a rejected constitution through the back door."
"It is a blind alley, and in my opinion it should be given very careful consideration."
"(PL) Mr President, the question we are discussing today in this House is not whether fundamental rights should be observed."
"We are not debating whether human rights are fundamental to our functioning within the European Union."
"What we are debating is whether yet another agency within our structures, another agency which will cost tens of millions of euro, really will be an instrument which will contribute towards the observance of and respect for human rights not only within the Member States, but also in the countries with which we have relations."
"I myself categorically reject the view put forward by some in this House, namely that we need to convince our electorate that we do care about something, and are therefore setting up an agency for that purpose."
"This is a flawed way of thinking, and it is wasteful."
"Our electorate will not be convinced of our concern."
"What they will be sure of is that we are spending their money, and therefore that we are even more cut off from them."
"It is the European Parliament we are all Members of that is the human rights agency for Europe."
"Of course we should gather data about the observance of human rights, but we should do so by spending money on supporting non-governmental organisations, rather than on yet another agency within our structures."
"(PL) Mr President, let me remind the House that six months ago we set up the European Institute for Gender Equality."
"Now we are to set up another agency."
"To start with, I would like to refer to the statements by Mrs Roure."
"She accuses my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of not speaking with one voice."
"Mrs Roure, please try and understand that in some parties, people are allowed to have different opinions."
"The Socialists might have a single, compulsory political line to toe, but with us things are different and I would like to add my voice in support of Mr Kirkhope."
"The purpose of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency is to fill a gap in the EU's activities."
"It is to concentrate on the EU's internal activities, covering the member institutions and Member States."
"Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to the external aspect, which focuses primarily on the candidate countries."
"This restriction on the scope of the Agency's activities is based on the view that a cohesive internal policy on fundamental rights is necessary if we are to have a consistent approach on human rights in international relations."
"However, I would like to remind you that observance of fundamental rights is a far greater problem in many countries outside the European Union, including neighbouring states such as Russia and Belarus."
"For this reason the Agency should not restrict its activities to the Member States, where genuine problems concerning human rights are incomparably smaller than outside its borders, particularly as each Member State has its own institutions to ensure respect for fundamental rights and human rights."
"I believe that we have missed a chance and an opportunity to bolster the external aspect of the European Union's human rights policy."
"The aim of the proposal to create this Agency is to broaden the mandate of the European Centre for Monitoring Racism and Xenophobia and to create a European Union Fundamental Rights Agency."
"It will create a specialist centre of knowledge concerning fundamental rights at European Union level."
"I would have no objection to this, apart from the fact that the Agency should also deal with the observance of human rights outside the European Union."
"I would not have anything against it, were it not for the fact that setting up this latest Agency will cost the citizens of the European Union more than EUR 150 million."
"What is the point of spending money on yet another institution in view of such a tight budget for the years 2007-2013?"
"(PL) Mr President, one of the aims that the European Union has set itself is to bolster the protection of human rights and its citizens' interests, as well as to protect freedom and support democracy on the basis of fundamental rights."
"This makes it important to secure assistance and specialist knowledge in the field of fundamental rights for relevant Community and Member State institutions."
"In view of the unusually heated debates and political battles that are currently taking place in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, I regard this proposal as being well-founded."
"A European Union Fundamental Rights Agency appointed as a successor to the European Centre for Monitoring Racism and Xenophobia would be responsible for supplementing existing fundamental rights monitoring mechanisms."
"However, care must be taken to ensure that this newly-created EU body operates on the principle of independence and accountability."
"On the one hand, it must be assured its independence, while on the other hand it must be fully accountable to the institutions of the European Union."
"For this reason both the internal decision-making processes within the institution and the appointment of its decision-making bodies must be transparent."
"The European Parliament plays a substantial role in fundamental rights, and therefore special consideration should be given to it when determining the Agency's structures so as to strengthen the legitimacy of the latter."
"Both the Commission and Parliament must take an active part in determining this Agency's multi-annual programme framework."
"In addition to the main area of the Agency's activity, which will be to assist European Union institutions and Member States, we should consider the possibility of developing collaboration with third countries to ensure the better implementation of Community law and internal policies of the European Union."
"In particular, collaboration with candidate countries should be promoted, as this will allow the EU to support their integration efforts with regard to the harmonisation of their national laws with Community law."
"It is important for the activities of this Agency to make allowance for the Council of Europe's range of activities in order to avoid overlap and achieve synergy in collaboration between the two organisations."
"(FI) Mr President, the Council of Europe is Europe's most important human rights agency, and will remain so even after this agency has been established."
"The Council of Europe has wide-ranging supervisory and monitoring rights."
"The agency under discussion will be completely different."
"The task of the agency will not be to monitor Member States but to provide them and the Union's institutions with information and expertise."
"The agency will be a service facility with the job of assisting us."
"The work of the agency would never focus on any particular country, and it would not investigate any individual outstanding events or breaches, as is the case with the Council of Europe."
"It is nevertheless important that this kind of independent agency for fundamental human rights, the Human Rights Agency, should be set up in the EU."
"It is also important that it works closely with the Council of Europe."
"In addition, I would like to stress that, now that we are seeing an increase in the powers of the police and are contemplating and tightening up counter-terrorist measures, it is important that at the same time we also take a look at how fundamental rights and human rights function."
"Furthermore, the work of this agency should, I believe, be extended to the third pillar, so that it might apply to police cooperation and cooperation on crime."
"In order to make progress, however, this cooperation, police cooperation and cooperation on crime, could, I think, be implemented in a more restricted form than in the Commission's proposal, for it to get through."
"Moreover, in the long term, the EU must also make up for its shortcomings in the sense that it does not intervene when Member States are in breach of human rights."
"We have no mechanisms for that."
"We know that human rights do not currently function in the best possible way inside the EU, and we should also be addressing those problems and not just looking at what is happening outside the EU."
"Of course, it is important to monitor and intervene in human rights violations wherever they take place, but the EU and its Member States should obviously ensure that the human rights of their own citizens and those living here are respected."
"(NL) Mr President, human rights are a global issue."
"Despite major failings, we in Europe are in the lead."
"There are agreements in the Council of Europe about the level of human rights to be guaranteed in Europe at least."
"The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is binding upon 47 Member States, 20 states more, therefore, than the 27 that will belong to the European Union from 2007."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights from 2000 is the largest common denominator of existing provisions from national constitutions and that European Convention."
"This Charter was later included in the draft for a constitution as Chapter II."
"In this connection, reference was made, with good reason, to the existing European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights to which the EU would also thereby subscribe."
"It would be good if the now proposed Human Rights Agency could serve as a signal to demonstrate that the European Union attaches greater importance to human rights than to the common market."
"Some of my group see this proposal, above all, as carrying an entirely different message, and as being an attempt at staging a competitive battle with the Council of Europe and a chance to campaign for the text of the constitution, which has already been rejected twice, and to which we are opposed."
"Mr President, last week's gem in this place was that Europol be given fresh powers to police Euroland whilst Europol itself was placed above the law."
"Even the Third Reich did not think of that one."
"This week is even better: an agency for fundamental rights has been conceived to ensure that Member States comply with the Charter."
"But this was contained in a failed EU Constitution."
"After all, France and Holland exercised their fundamental right to say 'no' to this and yet again you are trying to sneak large parts of the Constitution in through the back door."
"Mrs Gál even begins her statement by saying that the suspension of the Constitution-making process makes this the right moment to promote fundamental rights."
"Is that what you said?"
"The Politburo would be pleased with that."
"In fact, if fundamental rights really meant anything in the EU, the democratic rejection of the Constitution would make this absolutely the wrong moment to bring forward such a proposal."
"There was I believe an old Glen Miller song beginning: 'Sleepy time Gal, you're turning night into day'."
"You may believe that you can turn 'no' into 'yes', but when the sleepy time voters wake up, they will soon throw this out."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"The proposal for a Council decision to extend the powers of the current European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia is an important step in the right direction."
"At a difficult moment in time, when the global requirements for security and stability are clashing with citizens' rights and when discrimination even in the Western world is still a serious source of friction among communities, ethnic groups, religions and the underprivileged, it has become vital to monitor these developments by means of a body with a strong, extensive remit."
"I am therefore in favour of the proposal to extend the powers of the new Fundamental Rights Agency to include the 'third pillar', and thus intergovernmental cooperation in police, judicial, immigration and terrorist matters, since these sectors are becoming more and more closely associated with Europeans' everyday lives, and consequently with respect for the fundamental rights guaranteed by our Treaties."
"I also support the approach presented by this Parliament to encourage dialogue with civil society and to cooperate with all of those bodies, especially non-governmental ones, that both at local and at national and European levels do a great deal to help improve the human rights situation within the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, human rights are a great good, one that we have to work to defend throughout the world, and, aware though I am of the sad events in Russia, there is still much for us to do at home."
"Important though Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty are as cornerstones, we cannot - we must not - leave it at that."
"Since we do not believe that it is sufficient to make little more than cursory mention to them, we cannot say often enough, in any discussion of them, that what we need above all is our own comprehensive catalogue of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the form of binding European law."
"We do need the European Constitution, and the European Charter of Human Rights contained in it must become more than just a solemn declaration."
"Only when it has become binding and directly applicable European law can the celebrations begin, and that is a priority for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as much as it is for the other groups."
"Given the high value that we rightly attach to fundamental rights, it also goes without saying that all the essential functions involved in ensuring compliance with fundamental rights must remain reserved, in the main, to the EU institutions."
"The agency we are discussing today can, may and should, have exclusively ancillary functions, and it is in this respect that I have my doubts about this document."
"Commissioner Frattini said, among other things, that the Agency is meant to monitor compliance with fundamental rights, so what has become of the Commission's core function?"
"I have, for many years, been teaching my university students that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and watches over them and that it is the European Court of Justice that exists to guarantee the judicial protection of European law, and does an outstanding job of it too."
"By the way, are the democratic and legal structures in our Member States really as much at risk as some speakers today have claimed?"
"Some Members' speeches today really have got me worried."
"Last, but not least, political control over European requirements is one of the essential functions of this House, of the European Parliament itself, and that is the way it must stay."
"It is for that reason that our group, faced with the topic of agencies, concerned itself with, and gave thought to, such mundane things as bureaucracy, parallel structures, duplication and additional funding."
"Mrs Gál has our wholehearted backing in the work she has done and is doing; the preparatory steps she has taken in this area are good and important."
"We would, though, like it to be borne in mind that it is not acceptable that the rules applicable to all other agencies should not be binding on this one."
"That goes against common sense."
"The assessment role that this agency is planned to have is something else that we ought by rights to leave with the European Court of Justice, rather than allowing it to be put at risk by duplicated functions."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, protecting human rights, civil rights and political freedoms in the world today is one of the European Union's most important spheres of activity."
"The EU's growing importance in international relations and the development of a common foreign policy require new institutions that will make it possible to utilise the Community's political and economic potential to the full."
"Expanding the existing European Centre for Monitoring Racism and Xenophobia and extending its mandate so that it becomes the Fundamental Rights Agency will lay the foundations of a new Agency that will become one of the leading European institutions in the years to come."
"In order for the Fundamental Rights Agency to be able to fulfil this role, it must have a broader remit concerning issues pertaining to cooperation between the police, court and justice systems and also to immigration and combating terrorism."
"In the first place, therefore, the role of the European Parliament in setting out the mandate and defining the structure of the Agency must be strengthened."
"The Agency should be required to consult with the European Parliament as regards its multi-annual frameworks and candidates for the post of its director."
"The Agency must be open to participation by candidate countries and those with which a stabilisation and association agreement has been signed."
"The future Agency will have to appoint a scientific committee which will ensure the high academic quality of its operations, and it must collaborate closely with the Council of Europe and coordinate its activities with the latter."
"I would also like to underline that the tasks of the Agency, which will replace the existing Centre for Monitoring Racism and Xenophobia, should continue to cover racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and protecting minority rights as key elements in the protection of fundamental rights."
"All of the Agency's reports must take full account of the issue of gender equality."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank you and my colleagues for the help and backing I have received."
"As I warned you in my introduction, the Agency is highly debated and provokes reactions."
"But I have to assure all of you, in answer to Mrs Roure's question, that the PPE-DE Group is backing me, and this support will be converted into votes in a few minutes."
"There will be some delegations who vote against the report for different reasons, mainly questioning the role of the agencies in general, but the PPE-DE Group is well aware of the need to protect fundamental rights."
"The rapporteur did not have an easy task, as you could hear before, if you listened carefully."
"But let me underline the fact that there is a Council decision to establish a Fundamental Rights Agency from 2004 extending the mandate of the existing European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies tried to do our best to design a mandate which can enable useful, effective and objective work to be done."
"This is exactly what our societies are expecting from us."
"rapporteur. - (HU) This may be unusual, but in my first sentence, I would like to thank Mrs Gál for her cooperation."
"The very useful and effective collaboration that has evolved between the two parliamentary groups within the committee is primarily her doing."
"Nevertheless, today it has become clear that not all our fellow MEPs share the belief that membership in the EU does not automatically go hand in hand with a system of guarantees for human rights in the Member States."
"Not everyone accepts that we need to develop further that system of guarantees."
"There are some who ask and hope for assistance."
"I thank those who are asking for help, for wanting to help their own countries as well."
"Some take the view that the EU institutions should not look over their shoulders into their local card games."
"I am proud that my political group supports both proposals, mine and that of Mrs Gál, along the lines of a shared set of values."
"I regret very much that some people make a mockery of this."
"I think such mockery would have more success in Hyde Park than in the European Parliament."
"All the same, I am asking my fellow MEPs to overcome their fear of bureaucracy for the sake of a crucial cause, and to ask themselves whether we spend every penny of the common budget as usefully as is now being requested for the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"In fact, we are always prepared to cooperate in improving the efficiency of our budgetary spending."
"I look forward to your support in this important endeavour."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank once again the two rapporteurs and all those who have spoken."
"I recognise the need, firstly, for this Parliament to show a large majority, as hoped for by the two rapporteurs, in favour of this initiative."
"Otherwise, our joint efforts would be thwarted."
"We have worked together to give Parliament a strong and authoritative voice, even in the absence of the formal codecision procedure."
"Let us avoid a division in this Parliament that would give the Council the impression that, all things considered, it might even take decisions alone."
"This is a political necessity, not least because I have heard certain influential Members of this Parliament doubting the very raison d'être of the agency."
"First, we need to clarify the figures being cited."
"I have heard it said that the agency will cost EUR 150 million."
"That is not true."
"The institution in question will cost, in 2007, EUR 14 million, not EUR 150 million, and will eventually cost, in 2010, EUR 21 million, not EUR 150 million."
"The agency, which is the natural successor of the Vienna Monitoring Centre, which employs 40 people, will have 50 officials in 2007, an increase of just 10 employees."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 50 officials correspond to the staff of a small European municipality of 10 000 or 15 000 inhabitants."
"Do we really believe that it is not worth having 50 people working to maintain a high level of vigilance in connection with human rights in Europe?"
"I believe it is worth it."
"Why do we need an agency?"
"We need an agency in order to have independent evaluation, which is precisely what many Members of Parliament have pointed out."
"I have heard someone ask: 'But what has the Commission got to do with it?'"
"The Commission will work much better if it is able to make use of an agency that is capable independently of supplying it with material on the basis of which it can carry out evaluations and form opinions."
"I want to reassure Mr Rack: we will continue to carry out our duties, which in this field are not bureaucratic duties but, rather, political support for the work of Parliament and the Council."
"This is why we need an independent agency that will supply us with material with which to draw up our proposals."
"It is clear that the Commission's work will not diminish, rather it will be strengthened and increased."
"What is the Council of Europe's role?"
"The Council of Europe will continue to carry out its own work."
"I can confirm: we do not want overlapping and, in this sector too, the rules of the Treaties apply."
"The agency will be responsible for monitoring respect for fundamental rights on the basis of Community law whereas, as you well know, the Council of Europe does not have competence in the field of human rights under Community legislation."
"Consequently, the areas of activity of the two institutions will be absolutely separate, and this is a requirement that we intend to safeguard."
"I defend the Fundamental Rights Agency precisely because I do not believe that it should be used to point the finger at this or that Member State or to serve as a tool of political fighting, infighting even."
"That would be a mistake, and I agree with those who argue that the formulation of political opinions cannot be left to officials."
"That task will remain in the hands of the Commission."
"We hope for an agency that will help to increase transparency in Europe concerning the procedures for guaranteeing fundamental rights."
"If I make reference to political groups and the judiciary in Europe, it is because I believe that they too must wish - and I am sure that they do - for transparency in the protection of fundamental rights in their activities."
"It will in fact be much better for the authority of the institutions of the police and judiciary if they are guaranteed complete transparency regarding procedures for carrying out their crime-fighting activities."
"This is an initiative geared towards helping them, rather than hindering them."
"It is certainly not the intention of the Fundamental Rights Agency to put obstacles in their way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m.)"
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"The European Union has always presented the protection and promotion of fundamental rights as one of its basic policy objectives."
"In this respect, the creation of the agency to protect and promote these rights is an important tool in meeting this objective within the framework of the recently endorsed 'The Hague Programme' action plan."
"Establishing this agency is therefore a very practical step, as it is a new initiative that will allow the collection and analysis of data at EU level by a genuinely independent centre of expertise."
"Proposals from the Commission have legitimately given rise to a wide-ranging debate on the scope of the competences of such an agency."
"By expanding the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, we should ensure, on the one hand, that the focus on racism and xenophobia remains an important character of the agency and, on the other, that the agency's independence, not only with respect to the EU institutions but also with respect to the Member States, is maintained."
"Despite these concerns, I am optimistic that the European Parliament during the vote will broadly welcome the text proposed by the rapporteur."
"(HU) It would be difficult to overestimate the value of the creation of the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"It is, indeed, a milestone in the important struggle to defend human rights in Europe."
"At the same time, we have to state right away that it can only fulfil its role if endowed with real competence and the tools for effective functioning."
"Otherwise, it will degenerate into a self-serving paper mill, incapable of real influence."
"It is therefore necessary to set up an independent organisation with real and broad legal powers that can effectively intervene in cases of human rights violations."
"We have to put special emphasis on combating Europe's dark demons: the racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism that resurface from time to time, and - especially in the case of some new and newly-joining states in Central and Eastern Europe - atrocities and discrimination against the Roma and other ethnic or national minorities."
"Unfortunately, in recent times, we have witnessed several instances of such incidents that undermine the soul of Europe."
"The Agency must therefore pay special attention to these issues."
"It follows directly from my argument for an Agency with strong powers that its competence must inevitably extend to the matter of judicial and police cooperation, including matters relating to immigration and terrorism, as well as to the struggle against human trafficking, crimes against children, the drugs and arms trade, corruption and fraud."
"I would, of course, advocate its extension to a common foreign and security policy as well."
"I welcome the deeper involvement of the European Parliament in the Agency's work, since I believe that the Union's only directly elected body is one of the depositaries of the cause of human rights."

"Announcement by the President"
"As you know, on 15 June the European Parliament pronounced that it was in favour of the adoption of the euro by Slovenia from 1 January 2007."
"Certain technical adaptations are therefore necessary."
"Despite the fact that the Treaty does not require it, the Council has chosen to ask for an opinion."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the view that a resolution by Parliament was not necessary for that opinion, and Mrs Berès, chairman of that committee, has sent a letter to the President of Ecofin expressing the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' positive opinion of the technical adaptations to be carried out."
"We therefore wish our fellow European citizens in Slovenia the best of luck with their new currency."

"rapporteur. - Mr President, according to our rules, after a rejection of a legislative proposal, it should be referred back to committee."
"The aim of such a referral is to try and find an acceptable solution for Parliament."
"Unfortunately, in this specific case, a referral may be meaningless as the Council will not be able to change its position."
"At the same time, it is not the intention of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to impede the Council in taking its decision - as the committee can do according to the legal base in the Treaty."
"What we intend to do is to send our political message to the Council that Europol should be strengthened and founded on a sound legal base according to the EU Treaties in the same way that Eurojust is constituted."

"rapporteur. - Mr President, given the fact that we have adopted the amended proposal, I should like to ask Mr Frattini if he will accept the amendments just adopted by this House, or does he need more time for some final compromises in the Council?"
"Mr President, I believe that a further period of reflection would be appropriate."
"You all know my opinion on the amendments that you have just approved."
"The Council still has some difficulty in accepting them."
"I believe that the best solution would be to take some time and for us to attempt to convince the Council to accommodate the opinion expressed today by Parliament."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I therefore request that the vote be postponed and the matter be referred back to the committee responsible, pursuant to Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, in order to await the Council's position on the amendments."

"rapporteur. - (HU) Before the vote, which should be very straightforward, I have to correct a regrettable error."
"I wish to ask my fellow Members to please be advised that the new wording of paragraph 2a of the recital appears mistakenly on the voting list."
"I withdrew those of my proposals that concerned extending the Agency's remit to include the second pillar."
"On the other hand, the proposal which I retained and which appears on the voting list, replacing the proposed text of paragraph 3a of the recital, now has a new number, paragraph 3."
"I am asking my fellow Members to please cast their votes accordingly."
"If you deem it justified, Mr President, I shall read the short wording of the proposal to be voted on."
"With your permission and for the sake of simplicity, I will read it in French."
"(FR) 'The Agency's remit enables it to provide protection for human rights not only in the field of terrorism and organised crime but also in other fields, such as trafficking in persons, offences against children, illicit drug and arms trafficking and corruption and fraud, where measures can also weaken the effectiveness of the protection of human rights'."
"Thank you, Mr President, and may I also apologise, of course, to the House."
"- Before the final vote:"
"Mr President, I shall repeat a question to Vice-President Frattini that my honourable colleague has already asked: do you intend to accept all the amendments that the House has just adopted, or would you like more time to present some final compromise proposals?"
"I believe a little more time will be needed to consult with the Council, as the rapporteur said."
"Mr President, I naturally accept Mr Frattini's reply, and the process will remain the same."

"Whereas the English text makes explicit reference to accession to the Munich Convention, the French version talks in terms of discussion about accession to it, and there is a considerable difference between the two."
"We now, therefore, do not know how the text is to be interpreted."
"If the English version is normative, then the French MEPs need to be aware that they are agreeing to accession to the Munich Convention, even though the formulation in the French version is rather softer."
"The differences are in the detail."

"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"I welcome the conclusion of these bilateral agreements on the participation of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"These three countries are on the list of 13 candidate countries involved in the accession process, and this kind of agreement, whereby authorisation can be given for them to take part in Community programmes and agencies, seeks to strengthen the pre-accession strategy."
"Accordingly, this is one of the main ways in which to help the candidate countries implement the Community acquis more effectively because it ultimately acts as a kind of preparation process whereby these countries and their citizens might familiarise themselves with the Union's policies and working methods."
"These agreements lay down conditions for participating in the EMCDDA, along lines similar to those that apply to Norway."
"These agreements will certainly bring a great many benefits, and I see no problems as regards the participation arrangements, either on a technical level insofar as the countries concerned will have links to REITOX and will share data, in full compliance with Community and national rules on data protection or on a financial level, in that they will have to contribute to covering the cost of their participation."
"They will, moreover, be represented on the Executive Board, albeit without voting rights."
"in writing. (DA) The Galileo programme is an EU programme for satellite-based radio navigation."
"At present, all satellite-based radio navigation is based on the well-known GPS system and a Russian system."
"Galileo is a civilian system, whilst the American GPS is a military one."
"It will also be a better system from a technical point of view, with 30 satellites providing better coverage."
"For the commercial service, this will mean precision to within 3 mm, whereas GPS provides precision to within approximately 2 to 3 cm."
"Nowadays, satellite navigation is an indispensable tool in our daily lives."
"It is therefore unbelievably risky for this to be dependent on the discretion of the US military."
"Galileo is thus entirely necessary in order to provide a secure and independent navigation system."
"Everyone will be able to use the basic service free of charge."
"The project is an expensive business, costing around DKK 30 billion, but one that Denmark could not have carried off alone."
"Ultimately, if we wish to be independent of the US military, it is a project that the June Movement is able to support."
"The report also supports the extension of the project beyond the construction period."
"The June Movement is therefore voting in favour of the proposal."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by my honourable colleague Mr Pahor on the amendment of the incompatibility provisions in Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, which deal with the verification of credentials and the duration of the mandate It is indeed only right that the administrations of the Member States should be involved in the verification of credentials, particularly in cases where a new Member of the European Parliament holds an office that may be incompatible with membership of the European Parliament."
"I fully support the strategy that my friend Claude Moraes outlined in the House during the vote."
"Hopefully we have sent a political message to the Council without blocking the legislation."
"Parliament has consistently rejected all initiatives submitted to it, when consulted about detailed issues relating to Europol."
"We find ourselves in the same situation again."
"I therefore back the rapporteur's, Mr Morais', position that the initiative on amending Europol's staff regulations should be rejected, along with the initiative on adjusting their basic salaries."
"I completely understand that Europol needs to carry out internal adjustments, but it makes no sense for Parliament to issue its opinion, because, as an intergovernmental institution, Parliament does not play a relevant role in this institution's administrative decision-making process."
"We have supported a great many initiatives aimed at broadening Europol's remit and giving it operational powers, thereby enabling it to become an effective weapon in the fight against organised crime."
"We have also, however, emphasised the need for this process to be accompanied by measures guaranteeing democratic and legal control."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will soon submit to us a proposal aimed at integrating Europol into the EU's institutional system, with the Europol Convention to be replaced by a Council decision, whereby the structure, working methods, scope of activity and missions will be subject to codecision."
"I fully support the approach to this report outlined by my friend Claude Moraes during the vote in the House."
"We will hopefully send an important political signal to Council without blocking the legislation."
"in writing. - (FR) Although some members of the Contact Group are doing everything in their power to reach an agreement within the prescribed time frame, in other words by the end of this year, the status of Kosovo has not yet been established."
"I am well aware that the partition of Kosovo is not on the negotiating agenda and that the international community pours scorn on the constitution that Serbia has just adopted, which grants extensive autonomy to the province of Kosovo, rightly regarded by Serbs as the cradle of their country."
"I am also well aware that these negotiations are a masquerade and that the aim is to impose the secession of Kosovo."
"Be that as it may, the report offered to us today seems to regard the independence of Kosovo as signed, sealed and delivered, because the aid it proposes is nothing short of a conventional donation to a country outside the EU."
"The few amendments relating to respect for human rights are nothing but a token gesture; the persecution of Serbian minorities under the indifferent eye of the multinational forces is a reality that surely warrants the utmost caution."
"We do not feel obliged to condone this situation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am used to seeing MEPs leave the Chamber when I begin to speak."
"I would like to thank those of you who have stayed to listen to this important statement on the report on the establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"I have voted for referral back to committee, but I would like to say on this subject that fundamental rights include that of pensioners to collect a pension."
"The socialist-communist government, currently in power in Italy and led by President Prodi, is cutting the pensions of 500 000 Italian citizens who have worked abroad, in Switzerland, by two thirds of the sum that they are currently receiving."
"It is as if we were to receive an allowance of one third of that received up to now."
"This is no way to treat pensioners, who have the right to live and to be able to count on a secure pension."
"What security have those who have found, at the beginning of the year, that their pension has been cut by a whole 66%?"
"Shame on the Prodi centre-left government in Italy."
"Mr President, the interpretation of my speech in Finnish yesterday was misleading and, in some parts, even contradictory to the original message."
"I find it very regrettable, especially because I had sent my speech in advance."
"It is a pity that even during the Finnish Presidency these kinds of mistakes take place."
"As much as we love to speak our own mother tongue and we are proud of it, these kinds of mistakes do not leave us much choice."
"Therefore I would ask my colleagues to read my original arguments on the requested closure of certain units in the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria when the final and accurate translation is available."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Korhola."
"You are right: the full multilingualism that we practice in this House often causes us problems, but please believe me that the services do what they can."
"Given the number of languages and technical difficulties we face, despite the fact that certain problems may arise such as the one you have mentioned, on the whole I believe that this Parliament offers an example to the world in terms of respecting multilingualism."
"in writing. - (FR) If there is one area in which Brussels is highly productive, it is surely that of creating agencies: defence, anti-drug, maritime, road and air safety, energy, reconstruction, etc., etc."
"Today it is the turn of the European Union's fundamental rights."
"Is this agency merely Europe's umpteenth smart gadget, or is it the key to the proper functioning of the democracies in the Union?"
"According to this report, 'Fundamental rights should be at the heart of all EU policies and measures so that Europe is indeed referred to as a symbol of fundamental rights'."
"Magnificent!"
"Superb!"
"The only snag is that things look rather different in the real world."
"Today in the Kingdom of Belgium, a veritable banana oligarchy, an opposition leader was sentenced to ten years of ineligibility for public office simply because of his views."
"Similarly, Jean-Marie Le Pen was bitterly condemned in France for having expressed a moderate view, very widely endorsed by the French people, on the consequences of a massive influx of Muslim immigrants."
"In Britain this month, proceedings were initiated against Mr Nick Griffin, also for having expressed his views, following provocation unworthy of a BBC journalist."
"One cannot fail to conclude that freedom of expression and freedom of opinion are being ever more frequently threatened and flouted and are giving way to self-censorship and intellectual terrorism."
"in writing. (SV) 'In view of the actually suspended constitution-making process of the European Union (EU), the rapporteur considers that it is the right moment for Europe to flag the protection and promotion of fundamental human rights.'"
"This is how the rapporteur chooses to justify the need for a new agency to monitor rights."
"Since 1953, this function has been performed at the highest level by the well-respected European Court of Human Rights, to which many more states are party than there are EU Member States, and the process has been highly successful."
"The apparent aim of this report is to set up an agency to monitor fundamental human rights entirely because the Constitution has not been adopted."
"This is a quite remarkable idea and shows once again the EU's tireless yearning to become a supranational power that controls everything in every field without paying any heed to the existence of inter-state treaties and agreements or the national right of self-determination."
"The June List has nonetheless voted in favour of a series of amendments relating to democratic scrutiny of the Agency's activities and a fair gender distribution amongst its members."
"We have also voted in favour of children's rights having a prominent place in the activities of the Agency, should the proposal go through."
"The June List rejects the report overall."
"I welcome this legislation, which concerns the transformation of the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia into a fully fledged Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"The aim is to have an independent body which monitors in a continuous and systematic manner the conformity of national and European laws against established international Human Rights norms."
"The Fundamental Rights Agency will in turn be able to draft reports and opinions for the EU institutions and provide guidance and opinions."
"Member States and EU institutions will not be bound by its findings."
"in writing. - (FR) I believe it is important to create an Agency for Fundamental Rights that is both independent and accountable."
"It is necessary to strike a balance between these two requirements while bearing in mind that the main objective is to devise a functional and effective body."
"If that objective is to be achieved, active cooperation among the three European institutions will be indispensable."
"It is, first and foremost, a matter of reaching a political consensus."
"The Council, however, has let it be known that it does not wish the powers of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to be extended to the third pillar, in other words to intergovernmental cooperation in the fields of policing, justice, immigration and anti-terrorist activities."
"The Netherlands has even announced that it will use its veto to prevent the agency from starting its work on 1 January 2007 because it would duplicate the efforts of the Council of Europe."
"For this reason, while I voted in favour of the whole package of amendments to Mrs Gál's report, I nevertheless came down in favour of deferring the final vote to let the Council reconsider its position."
"in writing. - (FR) According to this report, 'the Fundamental Rights Agency could be a proper body providing a regular overview on the enforcement of human rights'."
"Accordingly, one case that the future agency will certainly have to examine is the current wave of attacks on freedom of expression in Europe."
"Sadly, there is no shortage of examples: from the caricatures of Mohammed published in a Danish newspaper, which provoked the murder of priests in Turkey, violent demonstrations and the burning of churches, to the lecture delivered by Pope Benedict XVI which a Turkish Muslim leader denounced as reflecting 'hatred and enmity' and, more recently, to the ordeal of French philosopher Robert Redeker, who has been subjected to death threats and forced to change addresses on a daily basis because of an article on the Koran which was deemed to be hostile and offensive to the Prophet, to Islam and to Muslims."
"Self-censorship, threats and aggression are becoming ever more widespread at the expense of freedom of expression and opinion, which are now probably the most endangered freedoms in Europe."
"Accordingly, if the first task of this future agency is to defend these freedoms effectively and to condemn violations of them, we are in favour of it."
"If it is not, the agency will just be yet another worthless and costly talking shop."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against the resolution on the future of patents, because I believe that the European Parliament should have sent a clear message, calling for Community rules in the field of European patents."
"The middle way envisaged by the Commission consists of adding some European elements to a system that is however, and will remain, essentially intergovernmental."
"The European Patent Office has already demonstrated its own ability to do damage in the field of software patentability."
"I hope that the Commission, instead of exploring the hybrid path that they are proposing to us, will want to return with courage to the idea of the Community patent, even against the trend for renationalisation, which is by now prevalent in all sectors of the European Union."
"Although the Council common position on a proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions was rejected in the European Parliament by a resounding majority (648 votes) in July 2005, the Commission relaunched the debate in January on the future of the patenting system in the EU. In so doing, it side-stepped the outcome of this vote, which was the result of a mass protest."
"The nub of the issue is the attempt to set up a European patent litigation organisation and a European patents court, whose decisions would override those of the national courts of each Member State."
"This court would remain under the control of the national representatives on the Board of the European Patent Office (EPO), who would moreover be responsible for appointing judges."
"In recent years, the EPO has issued hundreds of patents, for example on software, that some countries have deemed invalid."
"With the loss of sovereignty, the national courts would not be able to issue rulings against patents."
"As regards the resolution adopted today, which we voted against, we wish to reiterate our opposition to the idea of issuing patents on ideas and knowledge and to that of putting up barriers to intellectual freedom, technological innovation and the very competitiveness of the European economy."
"in writing. (DE) Since this House, in Article 1, is merely urging the Commission to explore various possibilities, it follows that decisions have not yet been taken as to which solutions should be chosen."
"In the interests of completeness, then, measures should also be analysed that do not enjoy the approval of all sides."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted in favour of the Jeggle report, in a convinced and reasoned manner, because I am of the opinion that it is one of the initiatives that will take forward the debate on the subject of research on animals, that is to say on limiting research on live animals as much as possible."
"I believe that we must seize every opportunity in this regard, as we have done in relation to the initiative in question."
"I am aware of the fact that the legal basis for other sectors is not the most self-evident."
"Nevertheless, I feel that we have taken a step forward, and I hope that others will follow in this direction."
"in writing. (SV) We voted against Mrs Jeggle's own-initiative report as a whole, because, in many areas, it counteracts the EU's efforts to strengthen animal protection."
"We are unable to support the idea that the EU should postpone the introduction of better animal protection until our trading partners within the WTO do likewise."
"This would seriously slow down progress in this area."
"In addition, we also reject the introduction of trade barriers against third countries with animal protection standards less rigorous than those of the EU."
"To do so would be to risk hitting developing countries that are dependent on agricultural exports to the EU."
"We would still like to stress, however, that we are positively disposed towards the Commission's Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals."
"We also welcome those parts of the report that propose further progress in a number of areas that are of importance to the protection of animals."
"I voted in favour of the first part of paragraph 71 of the Jeggle report, for the following reasons."
"1."
"Bullfighting is a centuries-old tradition that is rooted in various regions of different EU Member States. Its characteristics vary according to the country; in Portugal, for example, killing the bull was first prohibited in 1836."
"2."
"Bullfighting is responsible for the existence of the fighting bull, and, without it, this species would have become extinct a long time ago, given that rearing these animals has no economic value in terms of producing meat or milk;"
"3."
"This does not mean that the spectacle of the bullfight and the tradition associated with it should not evolve and adapt to the moral values of the time. The current trend is to be on hand as quickly as possible to ensure that animals do not continue to suffer physically."
"There are prestigious sports that have evolved from violent practices. One example is fencing in which, nowadays, the participants are not physical harmed."
"In bullfighting, the iron spike could easily be replaced by an electronic stick which, when it came into contact with the animal, could produce the same effect in terms of spectacle."
"4."
"Paragraph No 71 of the report, by simplistically proposing an end to bullfighting ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Although animal protection and welfare are important - not least because of the correlation between the quality of human life, on the one hand, and food safety and the quality of products of animal origin on the other - specific traditions and cultures must also be taken into account."
"We support a number of ideas in the report."
"For example, the protection of animals is an expression of humanity; the scope of European policy should be extended beyond the welfare of farm animals; account must be taken of the EU's specific regional and environmental characteristics; and a transversal animal protection policy should be promoted, covering legislation, vocational training, financial support and scientific research."
"We would also like to highlight, on the positive side, the reference to the need to take account of the size of farms and the additional costs involved in animal protection. Farmers, in particular those on small and medium-sized holdings and those involved in traditional farming, should be compensated for financial losses incurred in implementing animal welfare measures."
"As regards bullfighting, we do not accept the rapporteur's position, given that it is wrong to apply a broad brush approach to everything."
"For example, it is wrong to treat rope bullfighting in the Azores in the same way as bullfighting in which the bull dies, although the latter must also be understood in the context of local cultures and traditions, which can develop new practices."
"in writing. - (FR) I abstained in the final vote on this report because the European Parliament, as is its wont, has translated its honourable intentions into an avalanche of unenforceable rules and regulations."
"Who can check the time that cows spend grazing in pastures?"
"Who can verify the actual age of a piglet prior to castration?"
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions!"
"I voted in favour of the amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats providing for the removal of the word 'bull' from paragraph 71 of the Jeggle report."
"I voted this way because the fighting bull must not be allowed to die out, and its existence is safeguarded by the institution of the bullfight."
"Having said that, I am repulsed by the spectacle of the bullfight as it is currently practised in Portugal and in other EU Member States. Under the cloak of the flimsy pretext of 'tradition', this spectacle trivialises the suffering of the animals in the guise of public entertainment."
"Like other aspects of daily life in our societies, bullfighting also has to evolve and to rid itself of the barbarism that it has inherited and that still marks it out."
"No aspect of public life should be immune to progress and to the evolution of people's sensibilities."
"This resolution should accordingly act as a warning to those who reject any kind of change in bullfighting. It is vital that this activity change as soon as possible so that it no longer depends crucially on animal suffering."
"Otherwise, my country, Portugal, together with the EU, will have to take drastic measures."
"The way in which a society treats animals reveals more than just its attitude to the animals themselves; it reveals that society's level of civilisation, humanity and progress."
"in writing. (SV) We believe that the implementation of a policy within the EU designed to ensure the protection and welfare of animals is most certainly one of the responsibilities of a union of fundamental values."
"I therefore concur, in the main, with the report, and I am voting in favour of it overall."
"However, I do not support the ideas, put forward in the explanatory statement of the report, of creating an EU centre or laboratory for the protection and welfare of animals."
"It is for the Member States to ensure that they implement an animal protection policy in accordance with the general strategy for animal protection agreed at EU level."
"in writing. (SV) We welcome the Commission's proposal for an Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010."
"There is a great need to make practical improvements to the conditions in which animals live, and the Commission's proposal contains many important proposals."
"Unfortunately, we have been forced to note that Mrs Jeggle's report has failed to live up to the high expectations that we had of it, amongst other things in the way it stresses that high standards of animal protection lead to reduced competitiveness. This risks making it impossible, in practice, to have a progressive policy in this area."
"We therefore chose to abstain in the final vote on this report today."
"in writing. (SV) We believe that the implementation of a policy within the EU designed to ensure the protection and welfare of animals is most certainly one of the responsibilities of a union of fundamental values."
"I therefore concur, in the main, with the report, and I am voting in favour of it overall."
"However, I do not support the ideas, put forward in the explanatory statement of the report, of creating an EU centre or laboratory for the protection and welfare of animals."
"It is for the Member States to ensure that they implement an animal protection policy in accordance with the general strategy for animal protection agreed at EU level."
"Similarly, I do not support part of what is called for by paragraph 71 of the draft report, namely that dog, bull and cock fighting should be brought to an end at EU level by means of European legislation."
"In our opinion, it is the citizens of each Member State who should have the final and decisive say, via national elections or referendums, on whether they wish to prohibit the activities mentioned above within the territories of their own countries."
"I voted for this Report, which contains many sensible suggestions for improving the welfare of animals."
"However, we must not only set high welfare standards, we must also enforce them."
"The enforcement of our existing laws on animal welfare is far too patchy."
"The Commission needs to challenge Member States to properly implement the law with improved inspection and the application of sanctions."
"This own-initiative report falls down on two counts."
"The first concerns the condemnation - happily not adopted - of bullfighting, because this issue hardly justifies concern on the part of the EU."
"As compliance with the minimum standards required of an EU Member State is not in question, I do not feel that the Community institutions should be issuing opinions on the matter."
"Furthermore, the attempt, via Community 'legislation', to impose on one Member State either the traditions and cultural values of another or the particular perspective of one of the Member States on traditions or cultural values foreign to it is, as much as anything, indicative of an arrogant and totally unacceptable attitude, and something we do not wish to see."
"This is irrespective of the opinion we may have of the traditions concerned."
"Let the EU deal with matters that relate to the Community and let the Member States deal with what should naturally fall under their competence."
"I voted for the report drafted by my excellent colleague Jan Christian Ehler on the follow-up to the report on competition in professional services."
"Nevertheless, I did abstain on some provisions relating to advertising in the absence of more precise information on the impact of the Communication on the professional and ethical quality of services and on their price."
"I share the view that it is imperative to incorporate providers of professional services into our European internal market, but we must take account of the specific characteristics of these professions as regards the indispensable requirement to afford special protection to European consumers in a market that is rapidly becoming more and more international."
"Over and above these considerations, it seems absolutely crucial to ensure that providers of professional services receive greater recognition from the European political institutions and that they have their proper place in the construct of the social market economy in Europe."
"The sole purpose of this report is to assess and promote reforms in the professional services sector by means of deregulation and the removal of all barriers to competition."
"This fulfils, in other words, the objectives of total deregulation and the strengthening of competition contained in the Kok report of November 2004 and included in the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy in 2005."
"It also forms part of the process of liberalising the services sector and of creating an internal market for services, as proposed in what is referred to as the Bolkestein Directive."
"In this context, the prevailing view is that the professions' self-regulation bodies are barriers to the free provision of services."
"We agree that some of these services are of general interest and should be considered public 'goods' and that, accordingly, there need to be rules to ensure the quality of service and to protect end-users and consumers."
"For this reason, the right of the Member States to regulate these activities at national level or to authorise self-regulation by professional bodies must not be undermined."
"The Member States must be entitled to draw up regulations based on traditional, geographical and demographic characteristics, or other special regulations, for example on advertising."
"Liberal and intellectual professions are given that description for the reason that they are simply different from other service providers in many ways."
"Whilst we need to guide them, to help them contribute to the Lisbon objectives as much as they can and show respect for the Convention's fundamental principles, we should not overlook their individuality."
"The Ehler report very much recognises this individuality, which is also why it can count on my backing."
"Where his report is concerned, Mr Ehler has gone about things the right way: by demanding that more structure be injected into the debate, so that clear questions can be matched by clear replies that are imbued with legal certainty."
"This is in the interest of the customers (entrepreneurs and consumers/clients), of competition and collegial relations within the professional group, as well as in the general interest."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my honourable colleague and friend, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on economic and trade relations between the European Union and Mercosur."
"I am particularly grateful to him for having accepted the amendments relating to the place of small and medium-sized enterprises in the cooperation chapter of the proposed association agreement with Mercosur, to the related funding implications and to the role of the representative organisations of SMEs."
"At a time when the negotiations at the World Trade Organization are deadlocked and the European Union is preparing to negotiate bilateral agreements, the report maps out the route to trade cooperation with that very important part of the American continent."
"If the association agreement could be finalised, it would create the world's largest interregional free-trade area and would present both parties with golden opportunities for trade and hence for economic growth while enhancing the international competitiveness of both markets."
"in writing. - (FR) In spite of its denials, the European Union is engaging in more and more bilateral trade negotiations in order to lessen the fallout from the foreseeable failure of the Doha Round of multilateral negotiations."
"These negotiations, however, have the same flaws as the WTO talks: the concessions made by the European Union to its trading partners are far greater than the partners' concessions to the EU, and European agriculture is being sacrificed with no guarantee that foreign markets will be truly opened to European industrial products or services."
"Some of the Mercosur countries, in fact, already benefit from the European Union's generalised system of preferences, which gives them duty-free and quota-free access to the European market."
"One wonders, moreover, what interest these future trading partners could have in such agreements, since the cost of failure to conclude an agreement would be minimal in relation to the present volume of trade between the two parties."
"The main motive behind this agreement seems to be sheer vanity, the desire to gain the distinction of having created the world's first interregional free-trade area, which would soon be extended to the whole American continent."
"This is yet another example of Brussels' propensity for letting ideological objectives override all other considerations, particularly economic and social considerations."
"in writing. (SV) The June List believes that when trade is freer, world prosperity is furthered."
"The concept of free trade, indeed, is based on the idea that the more parties there are to it, the better the results they will see."
"This own-initiative report contains much that is worthwhile and that could give rise to increased prosperity."
"Unfortunately, as is so often the case in this Parliament, there are also extraneous and unhelpful wordings."
"The report talks, for example, of the strategic external policy factors involved in an agreement, of aid and of giving Parliament more power in both trade and external policy matters."
"It is unfortunate that the points I have just mentioned overshadow the positives that could be achieved."
"I have therefore voted against the report in today's vote."
"The proposal to conclude an association agreement and to establish a free trade area between the EU and Mercosur forms part of the current crusade to open up the markets to global competition against the backdrop of the current deadlock at the WTO."
"The report manages to spell out the EU's ambition for dominance in Latin America, specifically in the Mercosur countries, in spite of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), whilst, remarkably, not undermining the FTAA."
"Contradictions? Surely not!"
"The majority in Parliament is seeking to bring all sectors into this free trade area, including what are known as the 'Singapore issues', namely investment, competition, public markets and trade facilitation."
"Furthermore, this majority lays claim to the EU being a model of integration for Latin America."
"We feel that the liberalisation of the markets undermines the sovereignty of the people and of (some) States when it comes to managing their resources and choosing a path of development for their countries to follow."
"With the liberalisation of world trade, workers' salaries and rights have come under pressure, and most small and medium-sized farms and SMEs have been put at risk, with the interests of the large multinationals and the concentration of capital brought to the fore."
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. (SV) Free trade is the most important agent of prosperity in the world, and the more countries that participate in it, the more the prosperity of those countries will grow."
"The incorporation of large parts of South America into a free trade area with the EU would therefore represent a big step towards prosperity and the elimination of poverty."
"This own-initiative report therefore contains many worthwhile proposals that could lead to increased prosperity if they were implemented."
"As so often in this Parliament, however, the report also, unfortunately, contains a number of points, the aim of which is to further the development of the EU into a federal superpower and to increase Parliament's power at the expense of the Member States."
"The report talks, for example, of the strategic external policy factors involved in an agreement, of aid and of giving Parliament more power over both trade policy and external policy."
"Despite the strong objections I have made, it is my judgment that it is better for this Interregional Association Agreement to be entered into than for it to be prevented."
"In general I welcome this report, which promotes the relaunching and strengthening of the bi-regional strategic partnership with Mercosur."
"It aims to reinforce regional integration as a priority dimension of support for development in Latin America, recognising the principles of 'less than full reciprocity' and 'special and differential treatment' depending on the levels of development and sectoral competitiveness of the two regions."
"It also advocates gradual and reciprocal liberalisation of trade."
"I feel, however, that there should be some caution in liberalising services (particularly public services)."
"There should at all times be recognition of the specific needs of developing countries."
"If applied in a timely and gradual manner, liberalisation has the key to unlock commercial potential and stimulate economic growth to the satisfaction of both parties."
"But it is not an end in itself and should not be seen as a panacea for all the problems that our partners face."
"The Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report reads like a wish list compiled by European mega-businesses and Mercosur's agri-businesses, who aim to establish, as quickly as possible, an EU/Mercosur free trade area."
"Neither compliance with human rights nor the effects on broad swathes of the population of both regions are treated as having any relevance whatever."
"While the report does highlight the costs that would result from a failure to adopt the agreement, it devotes not a single word to the social costs that an EU/Mercosur free trade area would bring with it, for the free trade agreements reached over the past decades show with terrible clarity that the liberalisation of trading relationships laid down in them does nothing to help increase prosperity."
"It is small-scale producers that are among the first to lose out as a result of free trade agreements, which facilitate access to the European market only for a few agricultural industry products."
"Where public procurement, services and investment rules are concerned, the EU is going on the offensive and demanding such things as equal access to Mercosur government tenders in the fields of water, transport and energy."
"It is clear that the EU has no desire to put issues of human rights and democracy at the heart of the trade agreements with Latin America; instead, it gives priority to free trade for businesses, as a result of which the poorer sectors of the population will lose out even more."
"Instead of a new round of negotiations towards the conclusion of the EU/Mercosur agreement, the EU should be beginning an inquiry into the social and economic consequences of liberalisation measures in Latin America."
"History has taught us that trade is an effective way of fostering positive relations between nations and boosting economic development This alone would be a good reason for us to seek to conclude an agreement with Mercosur, as I have advocated in both public speeches and political initiatives with the Commission."
"There are further factors, for example historical and cultural ties, which make our commitment in this area all the more justified."
"We refer specifically to Brazil and to the thriving Portuguese community in Venezuela."
"The recent accession of Venezuela gives the agreement a further external policy dimension, as this is not only an oil-producing country but also a country to which the EU needs to pay special attention."
"This agreement offers tremendous potential for progress and economic development, and for this reason, highlighting an issue that I have followed closely, I share the rapporteur's desire to call on the Commission to channel its efforts into making this enormous economic area viable."
"The claim is that the Commission wants there to be a balanced approach in dealing with ethanol-producing countries."
"In the two concrete cases that I am aware of, Mallow and Carlow sugar plants in Ireland, this balance is not apparent."
"Because the Irish Government did not do due diligence in its negotiations with the Commission for the compensation package as part of the closure of Mallow and Carlow under temporary sugar restructuring rules, we now find that the Commission is inflexible about turning these factories into ethanol-producing plants."
"In fact, despite repeated appeals to Commissioner Fischer Boel to allow the ruling to be reconsidered and allow ethanol to be produced in these factories using the sugar beet immediately available, I have been assured that the plants will be completely dismantled."
"in writing. (SV) We have voted against this resolution since it is designed to restrict access to the internal market for third countries and in various ways to make it more difficult for them to gain such access, and since it is designed to introduce various new forms of aid for EU farmers within the sector in question."
"We believe that the market in general must be opened up for agricultural produce, which also includes soft fruits and cherries intended for processing."
"In fact, it is scandalous that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should, quite out of the blue, submit to us here in the European Parliament a motion for a resolution such as this, which talks of excessive imports of soft fruits from third countries and seeks, amongst other things, to introduce the following:"
"qualified market access,"
"support mechanisms for producer groups,"
"special safeguard clauses for entry prices, and"
"financial support to take old soft fruit and cherry plantations out of production in the event of prolonged supply surpluses."
"We are absolutely opposed to proposals of this nature by this Parliament."
"in writing. (SV) I am voting against both of these reports because Mrs Kósáne Kovács' report will most likely stress that it is the job of the EU to decide on and implement a common foreign and security policy."
"I believe that what resources there are should be spent on existing bodies such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the European Court of Human Rights, rather than on competing with these institutions."

"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to inform you that we have a visit by a Delegation from the Japanese Parliament this afternoon and that that Delegation is in the official gallery, headed by Mr Tsushima Tuji, a great friend of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"The Delegation of our Japanese colleagues is taking part in the 27th interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and Japan."
"We have a long tradition of dialogue between the European Parliament and the Japanese Parliament."
"Initially it dealt with strictly commercial issues, but now it has branched out into many issues of concern to our respective people."
"We are delighted that our dialogue with Japan is being enhanced, within a context in which it is increasingly necessary for us to work together towards international security and stability."
"We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen."

"The final version of the draft agenda for the current part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 19 October 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Wednesday:"
"In view of the large number of debates scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, and having sought the opinion of the political groups, I propose that we extend the debates until 6 p.m., rather than 5.30, and Questions to the Council will therefore take place between 6 and 7 p.m."
"Are there are any comments?"
"Mr President, this is not the first time I have pointed out that whenever somebody suddenly wants to find some extra time from somewhere on the agenda, it always seems to be Question Time that is the victim."
"That is not fair."
"I believe that if Question Time starts half an hour later, it should continue for an extra half an hour at the end."
"That is my proposal."
"(Applause)"
"Good, I personally have no objection; we shall propose to the Council that it take part in Questions to the Council for an extra half an hour; that seems very appropriate."
"(Parliament accepted the proposal)"
"(NL) Mr President, according to the agenda, an oral question was going to be put on the subjects of gambling policy and infringement procedures; on Thursday, for obscure reasons, the Conference of Presidents removed it from the agenda even though we had included it in the compromise and therefore had to delete the reference to the infringement procedures."
"The question is now off the table."
"I should like to propose making the Conference of Presidents' meetings public in future, for then we could be given some insight into the reasons and arguments adduced by one side or the other in them."
"After all, we have also demanded that the Council's meetings be made public too."
"I would therefore express the wish that the Conference of Presidents' meetings be made public in future, so that we can avoid the underhand scheming that we are witnessing at the moment."
"Let us see whether your argument is justified."
"Are you saying that a question to the Council appeared on the agenda and that the Conference of Presidents decided to remove it?"
"I shall ask the secretariat to look into what you have told us, and then we will see what we can do about it."
"Mr President, the remarks by my colleague, Mr Manders, did not come over very clearly via the interpretation."
"What we are talking about is a question to the Commission on gambling and relevant infringement procedures."
"I am a coordinator on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as is Mr Manders."
"As the joint authors of this question, we understood that it was going to be on the agenda tonight when Mr McCreevy was here, and that was approved through the system."
"I am astonished to find that it has apparently been withdrawn at the request of the Conference of Presidents and I cannot understand why."
"Nobody has talked to me or Mr Manders as the authors of the question, or to any of my colleagues."
"Mr McCreevy from the Commission is ready to answer the question and yet for some inexplicable reason the Conference of Presidents has totally removed it from the agenda."
"Perhaps you can explain why?"
"(Applause)"
"Yes, the Conference of Presidents decided to remove this question from the agenda."
"(FR) Mr President, I may be able to clarify things."
"I replaced Mr Schulz at the Conference of Presidents and I asked for this question, which is on this evening's agenda, to be postponed until a later sitting so as to allow Parliament to take account of the new developments in this whole affair."
"The Conference of President granted this request."
"All right, the Conference of Presidents will therefore once again look into including this question in a later plenary sitting."
"Mr President, could I request, as a matter of courtesy, that the committee responsible for preparing this question - which was voted on in committee - should be informed of concerns before they come to you, so that we have a chance to talk about it."
"After all, we are the ones who have asked for it."
"We spent a long time carefully drafting the question and the Commissioner is ready to answer it."
"So why was it taken off the agenda without any consultation?"
"We are responsible in the committee for the questions and we do not expect the Conference of Presidents to overrule us unilaterally on a very technical matter."
"(Applause)"
"Excuse me, but the political groups, represented in the Conference of Presidents, are supposed to inform their members of the decisions taken by the Conference."
"You may not agree with it, but it is the decision that the Conference of Presidents has taken, and I cannot change it now; you must appreciate that I cannot rectify that decision."
"It is the responsibility of the political groups to inform their members of the decisions taken in the Conference of Presidents."
"Let us return to the business for Wednesday: the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has asked for the addition of a Commission statement on nuclear safety, relating to the ongoing problems of the Forsmark reactors, a statement that would be followed by a debate which would conclude with a motion for a resolution."
"Mr Turmes has the floor to explain this proposal."
"Mr President, we should like to add an item to Wednesday's agenda."
"In the light of the incident that took place at the Forsmark reactor in July, we should like to have a discussion with the Commission on nuclear safety."
"This House is divided over the issue of nuclear power, but, when it comes to safety, we all want to see a transparent debate on these issues."
"(IT) Mr President, without compromising - as Mr Turmes would have us do - the positions of those who are in favour or against nuclear power stations, I think that we should discuss these incidents, and whether or not they are serious."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Goebbels, we made it quite plain at the Conference of Presidents that we are very definitely in favour of this issue being discussed, but not during this part-session, since we have already had to move Question Time around within the agenda for lack of sufficient time with the Council."
"We will certainly back the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - or whoever it is who ends up asking for a debate - in getting this problem put on the agenda at a proper time."
"We are well aware of the problem, but our position is that it does not need to be debated this week."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"Mr President, I hope that other groups will support us if we put it back on the next agenda."
"I cannot guarantee it; in any event, you will have to discuss it with them."
"Mr President, perhaps I could urge Mr Turmes to raise the matter in committee first, which might be the more appropriate route to take, rather than seeking to turn this matter into an urgency, when I suspect it is not."
"I would welcome the opportunity to have the matter discussed in committee first, before we burden the House with it."
"I am not going to give you the floor to reply, Mr Turmes."
"Please keep the communications required to ascertain when and how this issue should be dealt with outside of plenary."
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"- (LT) At the end of the 19th century, the future of European fascism was born in Russia."
"The slogan was concise and clear: 'Beat the Jews!"
"Save Russia!'"
"More than a hundred years later, Russian political culture can be characterised by a similar slogan of hatred: 'Beat the Georgians!"
"Save Russia!'"
"The words have become a weapon for the Russian President, Foreign and Defence Ministers and the Russian Duma."
"Officers of lower rank and fascist gangs of bullies favour the persecution."
"It is not new, since the murder of people with darker faces in the streets of Russian cities has become routine."
"The European Union should employ its own slogan: 'Save Russia!"
"Stop Russian Nazism!'"
"Therefore, representatives of the Russian Government and democratic forces should be invited to discuss how the European Union can help today's Russia to avoid a pervasive plague of xenophobia at our goodwill common legal environment conference."
"(HU) The 2006 Nobel Peace Prize was given to Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist, and to his Grameen Bank."
"The decision of the Nobel Committee has not only given cause for rejoicing, but has also shown the way and given hope to those who are striving for a humane and peaceful world."
"Many of us believe that poverty and social exclusion are among the root causes of war and destructive impulses."
"There are people who are strangers in their own land, who have lost all human contact and the chance to feel at home in the world."
"Muhammad Yunus' microcredit system is not simply charity, which often helps to alleviate the guilty conscience of the well-to-do."
"Rather, it lends money and makes cooperation possible, as well as restoring people's faith in future opportunities."
"We, as MEPs, should look upon this year's Peace Prize as a challenge and a task."
"Poverty such as exists in Bangladesh may also be found in Europe."
"Let us consider again and again the potential for small steps, be they in credit, entrepreneurship or increasing knowledge, since small steps can take us a long way down the path towards human dignity."
"Mr President, this is more in the form of a question to you."
"I am aware that Mr Borrell Fontelles wrote to Mr Barroso and Mr Vanhanen, requesting that they communicate the names and portfolios of the two new Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania to this House by 23 October."
"I would like to know whether we have heard anything about that and whether we expect the names and portfolios to be communicated to us this week."
"I do not personally have the information you requested. I shall try to find out from the President's office."
"(FR) Mr President, two weeks ago, there was a train crash on the line between Luxembourg and France."
"That crash left six people dead and a dozen injured."
"I should therefore like to offer my condolences to the victims' families."
"After an accident such as that, we must move forward."
"One of the problems on the cross-border railways is that their safety systems vary greatly from one country to the next."
"Luxembourg has a different system to Belgium, which itself has a different system to France, which has a different system to Germany."
"Luxembourg's railways are therefore confronted with three different systems, in addition to their own."
"The best solution, after this crash, is to increase the investment in the European safety system, ERTMS."
"I hope that the European Commission will make Luxembourg and the wider Luxembourg region a pilot region for the introduction of new systems and arrangements."
"I also believe that the flagship train, namely the TGV that will link Paris to Luxembourg as from next year, which absolutely must be ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, the trial started in Turkey last week of three people responsible for translating a book by the American writer Noam Chomsky into Turkish."
"On the basis of section 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, the publisher, translator and publishing house are accused of causing public outcry and inciting hatred against Turks and of degrading democracy and the Turkish parliament."
"I remember that in plenary in September we discussed section 301 and the fact that Turkey should, at long last, comply with some of the values which the European Union stands for if it wishes to acquire the European profile it yearns for."
"One month later, we can see that nothing has changed and that Turkish intransigence continues unabated."
"I ask you therefore, Mr President, if we shall continue to watch this theatre of the absurd or if we shall strengthen democratic speech by condemning this new trial which infringes freedom of speech and human rights."
"(PL) Mr President, yesterday in Italy demonstrations took place in protest against the forced labour camps in that country."
"I fully support the demonstrators, but I would also like to point out that in early September my group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, requested a debate on the situation of foreign workers in European Union Member States."
"This is not just an Italian problem; it also affects other countries, some more than others."
"This House cannot remain silent on the matter."
"We need to send out an unequivocal message."
"In particular, we should appeal to the Member States not to allow serious infringements of human rights to occur."
"That is what the citizens expect, which is all the more reason for Parliament not to remain silent."
"I am therefore asking once again that the debate called for by the UEN Group take place."
"(EL) Mr President, President Borrell is due to visit Athens next week as part of an official programme."
"I should like to ask the President to find a little time, even just half an hour, to cross over from Parliament to the Parthenon, where he will see that some of the most beautiful creations of Phidias, the greatest artist of all times, are missing."
"The British have taken them. They are in the British Museum."
"It is unthinkable that these works from the Parthenon, which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, should be outside the Parthenon."
"I therefore wish to ask President Borrell to visit it, to see this repellent site and to lobby with us for the return of the sculptures which the English derisorily refer to as 'the Marbles'."
"They are the sculptures of the Parthenon."
"I repeat: one of the Seven Wonders of the World, which has been 'butchered', from which pieces have been removed which today adorn the British Museum."
"I appeal to all cultured people for the sculptures to be returned to the place in which they were created, to the Acropolis, to a place which all cultured people should visit."
"(PL) Mr President, over the last two years there have been occasions when serious differences of opinion have emerged between Mr Borrell, the President of the European Parliament, and many Polish MEPs, with the majority of Polish MEPs being critical of the President's opinion of our country."
"Today, however, I have to thank the President for his stance at the recent Lahti Summit, and I know I speak on behalf of many other Polish MEPs."
"According to the French daily Libération, Mr Borrell was one of five European leaders who dared to voice criticism of Russia."
"In this he was joined by the President of Poland and the Prime Ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Latvia."
"I would like to thank Mr Borrell for stating that the Union will not trade human rights for energy."
"I would also like to thank him for questioning whether Russia is still democratic."
"Europe will remember these pronouncements by President Borrell, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will remember his courage."
"I would therefore like to thank the President in his own language: gracias, Señor Presidente."
"(DE) Mr President, I wish to inform the House that the Ethiopian authorities, last Thursday, expelled two diplomats belonging to the EU delegation."
"This is in connection with the arrest of Yalemzewd Bekele, an Ethiopian member of the delegation's staff, who is accused by the authorities of active opposition to the Ethiopian Government, and who had therefore attempted to flee to Kenya."
"A fortnight ago, in Addis Ababa, Glenys Kinnock and I met the two diplomats and Mrs Bekele, who is currently held in the Moyale prison, and we entertain the gravest concerns about the treatment she is receiving there."
"This case has also been brought to the attention of the UN's special rapporteur on torture."
"I urge the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to take seriously its duty of care as an employer and provide Mrs Bekele with legal counsel."
"The troika should also travel from Addis Ababa to Moyale, assure themselves that Mrs Bekele is physically unharmed, and demand of the Ethiopian authorities that they clarify the accusations they are levelling against her."
"Our President should also write a letter to his Ethiopian counterpart."
"(HU) Today, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956."
"This is not solely a Hungarian celebration, but an international one: 56 Heads of State or Government have travelled to Hungary to celebrate this day with us."
"The significance of this event can be compared to the Prague Spring of 1968 and to the Polish Solidarity movement, for without these three historic events, the downfall of Soviet-style communism and the changes of regime in Central Europe in 1989 and 1990 would not have been possible."
"The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 is unique, however, for none of the other opposition movements involved armed battle against the Soviet army, and in no other instance did a country withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and declare its neutrality."
"The heroes of 1956 were united in the belief that a small nation could defeat a totalitarian superpower."
"In 1956 our request was: 'Back to Europe!'"
"And in 2004, with Hungary's accession to the European Union, the legacy of 1956 was fulfilled."
"Mr President, I want to ask the presidency of Parliament as well as MEPs across the spectrum to continue to press for the EU, as well as the UK authorities, to try to persuade President Musharraf of Pakistan urgently to use his powers to pardon or at least commute the sentence of Mirza Tahir Hussain."
"Mr Hussain is a dual British-Pakistani citizen who has been on death row for 18 years, convicted of a murder of which he has always protested his innocence."
"Indeed, he was only convicted in the Islamic Sharia courts after having been acquitted in the normal secular courts."
"We learned last week that the date for his execution had been postponed for another two months, putting it beyond the date this week when the heir to the British throne, the Prince of Wales, makes an official visit to Pakistan."
"However, I urge everyone to keep up their efforts to persuade President Musharraf to use his undoubted powers under the Constitution to resolve this situation in the sense of justice and not just postpone the execution."
"(ES) Mr President, I would urge the Commission and the Council - that is to say, the European Union - to express their concern to the Argentinean authorities about the fate of crucial witnesses in the ongoing trials aimed at tackling impunity and establishing responsibility for all illegal actions carried out during the dictatorship."
"One of these cases involves the disappearance of Jorge Julio López, who is crucial to the case against a Buenos Aires policeman, Miguel Etchecolatz, who was a torturer during the period of the dictatorship, the blackest period in the history of Argentina."
"This witness has been missing since September, and this has caused huge alarm amongst the many witnesses who must carry on testifying in order to reveal the truth and in order to ensure that no crime goes unpunished."
"I would therefore call upon the European Union to raise this specific case with the Argentinean authorities."
"Mr President, on 20 August 1989, on the River Thames, the gravel dredger Bowbelle collided with the pleasure cruiser Marchioness and 51 people lost their lives."
"That tragedy resulted in the Government implementing stricter safety requirements for those navigating on the River Thames."
"These safety regulations are now in danger of being diluted as a direct result of the Government's intention to implement EU Directive 96/50/EC."
"The current United Kingdom standards will be replaced by much lower standards under a harmonised European boatmaster's licence."
"However, this is not necessary, as the same directive allows, under Article 3(2), for Member States to apply exemptions on national waterways and issue boatmaster's certificates under their own conditions."
"I therefore call on all United Kingdom MEPs to write to the Minister, Dr Stephen Ladyman, asking him, in the interests of higher safety standards on the River Thames, to apply the derogation allowed under the directive."
"Mr President, if the Open Skies transport agreement for aviation is agreed between the United States and Europe, numerous benefits will flow: more routes, more competition and cheaper air fares - better all round for the traveller and the consumer."
"A major obstacle, namely, an objection on the European side to the exchange of passenger data with the United States, has now been overcome."
"However, there is another obstacle in relation to the ownership of airlines, which is causing major problems in the United States and has been objected to in Congress."
"In the meantime, the Irish Minister for Transport, Mr Cullen, is trying to get the Commission to agree to a one-to-one bilateral agreement between Ireland and the United States."
"I object to that on two fronts."
"Firstly, it will undermine the global trust of Open Skies; and secondly, it will do irreparable damage to Shannon Airport in Ireland, which has been the gateway for transatlantic travel."
"Until such time as there is a full global agreement, then no bilateral agreement should be concluded between Ireland and the United States."
"The Commission should reject it."
"(FR) Mr President, for some time now, the influx of migrants has been portrayed as a seemingly unacceptable threat."
"This rhetoric has been taken up by the far right, which is perpetuating the confusion between crime and immigration and which is thriving in this area."
"The fact is that these migrants are first and foremost victims: victims of the Mafia-like networks that become rich by bringing over men and women who want to build a future for themselves; and victims of European businessmen and slum landlords who prosper by enslaving a cheap workforce, in the former case, and by renting out insalubrious accommodation at exorbitant prices, in the latter case."
"Faced with that, let us put all of the existing Community instruments into operation so that we can combat these sectors."
"Let us review the regulation that stipulates that asylum applications must be reviewed by the first Member State in which asylum seekers step foot, because that puts an unacceptable burden on countries in Southern and Eastern Europe."
"Furthermore, the overcrowded and inhuman transit camps are no longer acceptable."
"Finally, let us have the objectivity and courage to say that Europe will need legal immigrants in order to compensate for its demographic deficit."
"Let us therefore move out of our political comfort zone, let us stop making facile ideological statements and let us clearly state that immigration can also represent an opportunity for Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, if we take stock of the Union's policy towards the countries of southeast Europe, focusing on the Western Balkans, we can see that it has had positive and negative results."
"Following the criticism directed at the strategy of further enlargement of the Union, which also concerns the Western Balkans, there is a feeling that the ability of the area in question to be heard by the European institutions has been impaired."
"I believe that, within the framework of parliamentary diplomacy, we have a responsibility to make the Union's strategy more cohesive, transparent and effective, so that the southern dimension of European policy becomes more visible."
". - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EADS and the industrial projects that this group comprises, including Airbus, make it one of the great flagships of Europe, an industrial flagship, the symbol of our future technology and capabilities."
"However, this business is in great difficulty."
"I shall not dwell on the reasons - including those to do with the way in which it has been managed - which may justify or explain some of its current difficulties, which, in turn, require effective remedies."
"I shall emphasise, instead, the statements made by Airbus's management team, who explain to us that, if the business is to be competitive, it will probably have to relocate or set up a number of its operations in the so-called 'dollar' currency area, for the sole reason that the euro/dollar exchange rate is putting one of the European Union's most important cutting-edge sectors at a disadvantage."
"When questioned on this point, Mr Trichet has only one thing to say: 'I do not have to explain myself regarding the exchange rate!'."
"Do you not think, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that there is an urgent need to change Europe's monetary policy?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) 50 years ago today, revolution broke out in Hungary."
"The site of the first battle in the nascent struggle for freedom from Soviet oppression took place at the headquarters of Hungarian Radio."
"The rebels knew that, in addition to force, the system was built first and foremost upon lies."
"The symbol of those lies was the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, namely state radio."
"The battle ended with the victory of the revolutionaries, and therefore the radio station was able to broadcast the words that would later become a catchphrase: 'We lied at night, we lied during the day, we lied on every wavelength.'"
"Force and lies: these are what kept communism alive in Hungary, and these were the building blocks of oppression in the rest of the Soviet bloc as well."
"Although the Hungarian Revolution was crushed by the overpowering columns of tanks that rolled into the country, today we know that the events in Budapest, Prague and Gdansk did not happen in vain, and that the victims did not give their lives in vain."
"Thanks to them, Europe today is free and united."
"However, in order to make sure that no system on our continent will ever be built on force and on lies again, we must remember."
"It is for this reason that my fellow Members and I have launched an initiative to make 4 November, the anniversary of the defeat of the Hungarian Revolution, a day of remembrance for the victims of communism in Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, on 29 August UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan tabled a study on violence against children by the independent expert Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro before the General Assembly."
"This study describes in the blackest terms the phenomenon of violence and child exploitation in the world, highlighting the serious infringements of the rights of the child."
"This study is a wake-up call for the collective conscience of mankind and a call to take action to defend fundamental humane principles and values."
"I believe, to take advantage of the presence here of Commissioner Frattini, that this UN study should be the subject of debate in the institutions of the European Union, especially the European Parliament, in conjunction with the recent communication from the European Commission on a European strategy for the rights of the child."
"The European Union must be at the vanguard of a common system of rules for the protection of children's rights which are binding on all the Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, we have heard from reports in the media that an airline employee in the United Kingdom is being persecuted and may be dismissed, purely and simply because she was wearing a chain with a cross the size of a five-cent piece around her neck."
"We talk about democracy, freedom and justice as principles which must also be consolidated in candidate countries."
"We want to give Europeans and everyone living on this planet the security of knowing that they will not be persecuted on the grounds of freedom of expression - irrespective of whether that freedom is expressed by word or by outer garments - and, more importantly, that they will not be persecuted for their religious faith."
"In my country, 80% of the people are baptised and wear a cross their whole life."
"How can we demand respect for religious freedoms from candidate countries when we do not protect the possibility of there being such a simple expression of religion?"
"I hope that the Commissioner will take steps ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to draw the House's attention to an occurrence several days ago involving Polish border guards and a German cruise ship, the Adler Dania, which entered the Polish port of Swinemünde, whereupon three Polish customs officers, in civilian clothing and without any written authorisation, sought to confiscate all the vessel's stocks of spirits."
"The captain responded to this by turning the vessel round and speeding back to Germany, with a Polish border protection force speedboat in hot pursuit and, moreover, firing off signal flares in the Adler Dania's direction."
"It defies belief that this sort of thing can happen, but it appears from the letters I have received from those with personal experience of these things that this is not, regrettably, an isolated incident."
"There are recurrent problems at the borders within Europe with many new Member States and also with other neighbouring countries, involving such things as the arbitrary levying of charges and attempts at coercing travellers into paying them or else being denied entry to the country they wish to enter."
"I demand that action be taken to deal with this."
"(EL) Mr President, a report by a US strategic analysis and study company states that Greek Cypriots and Greek soldiers missing since the invasion by the Turkish army of northern Cyprus were used as guinea pigs in industrial laboratories belonging to the Turkish army between 1984 and 1988."
"Given not only that Turkey continues to occupy the northern part of Cyprus, but also that it has never provided any information or details about the missing persons, and given that the relatives of the missing persons have been suffering for three decades now, I would ask Parliament to take the initiative of demanding that Turkey supply all the information it has on the missing persons, however awful it may be, so that this suffering can be brought to an end."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor because I wish to express my displeasure and concern about the future of Europe."
"I have always believed that one of the main objectives of the European Union was to protect children, to safeguard their education and health and ensure they grow up to be rounded human beings."
"I wish to express my acute displeasure about the establishment in Holland of the paedophile party, a party whose basic objectives are to legalise sexual intercourse between adults and children over 12 years of age and to legalise possession of child pornography for personal use."
"In a Europe which is growing old, in a Europe in which the institution of the family is growing weaker by the day, in a Europe in which morals and customs and traditions are disappearing, the establishment of this party looks like a bomb in the foundations of the European construct."
"I call on us all to oppose it."
"I propose that the European Parliament table a request to the Finnish Presidency to have the paedophile party abolished."
"If we want a European Union with a future and prospects, we must primarily and above all protect our children."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just returned from a visit to Lebanon with a feeling of optimism about the new situation in the area, but also with a greater awareness of the challenges which we all face."
"LIFE is returning to the south."
"Houses have been patched up and people are returning to live at home or with relatives pending reconstruction with the help of the government and donors, among which Hezbollah is playing an important part."
"The presence of the Lebanese army and UNIFIL forces is providing security and satisfaction to the citizens and, I must say, is giving visibility and appreciation to the European Union."
"The application of Resolution 1701 does not appear to be in danger, although the balance is fragile and we should protect it for the sake of peace in the area as a whole, just as we must support the Lebanese Government so that it can introduce suitable reforms of the economy, society and the political system."
"Apart from the defence of citizens' rights, I should like also to highlight the need for us to protect cultural treasures ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, via the Presidency of this House I would like to send a message of condolence and solidarity to various municipalities in Galicia, particularly in the province of Pontevedra, in view of the grave situation they are suffering as a result of serious floods since the weekend."
"The storm has caused serious damage."
"There has been great damage to homes, companies, transport routes, agriculture and cattle."
"Unfortunately, there have also been injuries and deaths."
"As we all know, last August the Autonomous Community of Galicia suffered an enormous disaster as a result of a great wave of fires, which this Parliament debated in September."
"On that occasion we backed the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund."
"The serious effects of the heavy rains over recent days are linked to the August fires, as today's Galician press points out."
"The loss of wooded areas and the tonnes of ash swept away have increased the ferocity of the floods."
"This is a further demonstration of the scale of the disaster that struck Galicia in the summer."
"Several Galicia municipalities are unfortunately once again in mourning."
"Mr President, we had a very useful dialogue last week with a group called EAGLES, which is made up of scientists from around the globe who are interested in helping the developing world, and I think it is a dialogue we need to extend throughout this Parliament."
"We are witnessing scientific apartheid on a vast scale: the developed world has too many scientists and engineers and the developing world has none, which is widening the gap between rich and poor."
"I have a very simple message which will not take a minute: there is an onus and a duty on the European Union and the Commission to work with the scientific community to persuade it to devote part of its efforts to projects that will help the developing world, whether it is for animal health, human health or agricultural production."
"This is a problem which is being neglected at the moment and the poor are suffering."
"It is something that this House should take on board by looking at the important role of science in the developing world."
"(ET) A couple of weeks ago the entire world was shocked by the murder of Anna Politkovskaya."
"The trampling of human rights and freedom of expression in Chechnya that Anna Politkovskaya sought to make public was stifled using the methods of gangster politics."
"A week ago we had to talk about the Georgian crisis, which Russia began with a political show of force, imposing economic sanctions and a transport and postal blockade against Georgia, prohibiting imports of Georgian goods, closing Russia's border with Georgia and beginning to deport Georgians from Russia."
"Today we must be prepared to prevent the possible use of all kinds of military force in connection with the secession attempts of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"The European Union and Parliament cannot simply stand by and watch the situation in Georgia unfold."
"We must use every available option - the whole gamut of measures provided for in the European Neighbourhood Policy, the organisation of border guard missions, the facilitation of free trade and the simplification of the visa system - with the objective of preserving peace in the South Caucasus."
"(FR) Mr President, Airbus's strategic and industrial decisions decide not only the fate of tens of thousands of employees but also the future of a large part of the European aeronautical industry."
"It is vital that respect be shown for the knowledge, work, and investment of Airbus's employees and subcontractors via efforts to prevent a situation in which they are reduced to nothing."
"Airbus's employees should under no circumstances be made to pay for the mistakes and the errors made by the managers and shareholders."
"Through the knowledge that they bring, these employees represent the true jewel in Airbus's crown."
"Airbus is failing because of the liberal policies that have been implemented, and, if it is to get back on track, a return to public ownership and funding of EADS at European level is required."
"I am also pleased to note that, in both Germany and Spain, many people are speaking out in an effort to see the employees granted genuine powers to intervene in the management of Airbus."
"Let Mr Mandelson do his job so that the Americans no longer challenge the system of repayable advances and so that the European Central Bank and the Commission intervene at last to counter the weak dollar."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my intervention relates to the problem of stray dogs on Corfu."
"The Austrian animal welfare association has for some years been supporting many projects on Corfu, although the local authorities constantly prevent it from doing its work in an effective and efficient manner."
"Foreign veterinarians are disbarred from treating animals, homes for animals that have already been built are prevented from being taken into service, and, even though the travel agency TUI funded the project, stray dogs are not allowed to be sent to families in Germany and Austria, but instead meet a cruel death in Corfu."
"I appeal to the Council, and to the Members of this House, to do something about this state of affairs, demanding in particular that aid from overseas be permitted and recognised in order to resolve the problem with the minimum possible delay and for the animals' benefit."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago this evening the students and intellectuals of Budapest presented 16 demands to the Hungarian puppet government."
"The demands were rejected, the authorities opened fire on the crowd and the uprising began."
"The Hungarians were encouraged by their faith in assistance from the West."
"European unity appeared natural to them."
"The expected assistance did not come, however, not even in the form of official declarations."
"The Suez Crisis that was unfolding at the same time somewhat limited the West's ability to act, but the real reason for this reserve was the division of Europe into spheres of influence at Yalta."
"13 000 people were repressed by the Soviets, 350 of whom were executed."
"Hungary became a cautionary case for other nations that thirsted for freedom."
"The Soviet Union no longer exists, but the spirit of Yalta lives on in our fear of standing up in defence of Moldova, Georgia and other countries that Russia considers to be part of its sphere of influence."
"In memory of the victims of the Hungarian uprising, I propose that we overcome our fear and take a united stand in defence of democracy and freedom."
"(PL) Mr President, creating a common market for energy that is as efficient, secure and competitive as possible is a priority for the European Union."
"It is important to remember, however, that the impact of the Union's energy policy extends beyond the energy sector, and that the three political objectives of energy policy are to ensure the security of energy supplies, to ensure competitiveness and to protect the environment, notably by countering climate change."
"As we are aware, the creation of the internal energy market is brought about indirectly through harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States, and directly through liberalisation of national energy markets."
"Nonetheless, Europe needs a single common strategy and broadly based cooperation both as regards the common internal market and as regards foreign partners."
"That is why I am delighted that at the recent Lahti Summit, where, for the first time in many years, the European Union countries endeavoured to speak about energy cooperation with Russia in one single voice, and individual Member States did not allow themselves to be led astray by the prospect of the potential benefits of a special relationship with Russia."
"(PL) Mr President, I have attended two important events this month."
"One was the conference on the simplification of the common agricultural policy organised by the European Commission, and the other was the Conference of European Farmers, held under the auspices of COPA/COGECA."
"It was repeatedly stated that what Europe needs is a clearly defined strategy for agriculture and the future of its farmers."
"What is it actually getting?"
"Wave after wave of reforms churned out every few years."
"Farmers need stability to be able to plan production and investment."
"We would do well to remember that if it is denied aid of any kind, European agriculture will have great difficulty in competing with products imported from other countries."
"Europe is already at a disadvantage, because the requirements imposed on our farmers are much stricter, and their production conditions are often more difficult."
"It is therefore incumbent on us to enlighten the citizens and also certain Members of this House as to why we have a common agricultural policy, what its benefits are and why consumers have to pay its costs."
"Mr President, Mr Behiç Aşçi is a Turkish lawyer who has been on hunger strike for 202 days and is now very close to death."
"Although not a prisoner himself, he is protesting against the inhuman action of Turkish authorities in subjecting mainly political prisoners to isolation in so-called F-type prisons."
"One hundred and twenty-two hunger strikers in such prisons have died so far, and yet the Turkish Government stubbornly refuses even to discuss the matter."
"Isolation, sometimes for years, is one of the worst forms of psychological torture and Turkish civil society, including the lawyers' and doctors' associations, have called for its abolition."
"I call upon you, Mr President, in the name of respect for human rights and in order to save Mr Aşçi's life, to contact the Turkish Prime Minister urgently and stress to him that isolation in F-type prisons is incompatible with Turkey's European aspirations and must cease forthwith."
"(HU) Today we remember events that occurred 50 years ago, those of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the people's revolution, which shook the communist system that had been thought to be rock solid."
"What were the Hungarian people fighting for?"
"For freedom and independence."
"We Hungarians living beyond the borders of Hungary were also following the heroic struggle against the overwhelming Soviet power with concern and keen attention."
"The defeat of the Revolution was followed by dark, cruel years and harsh reprisals."
"Particularly in Transylvania, but in Slovakia as well, those who openly sympathised with the Revolution were subjected to severe retribution."
"It is with deep reverence that we recall the victims, the heroic freedom fighters, whose struggle was not in vain."
"34 years later, the inhuman system fell, and today we belong to a European Community which is based on democracy, the rule of law and human and civil rights."
"It was for these values that the participants fought and the heroic dead gave their lives during the 1956 Revolution."
"Mr President, last week the informal EU summit in Lahti, under the Finnish Presidency, marked a very important step in EU-Russia relations."
"After a long time the EU was able to speak with one voice and what is especially important is that the EU was united in speaking about EU energy policy."
"As the need for an increased energy supply and increased energy security are of common interest to the Union, I would like to stress that some projects in the Baltic Sea region ignore the interests of a number of Member States in terms of security of energy supply, particularly the North European Gas Pipeline project, which in 2000 was granted Trans-European Energy Network status."
"I suggest that we call on the countries already involved in the project, namely Germany and Russia, to invite the neighbouring countries, EU Member States, to join the network and provide them with an opportunity of real partnership."
"This item is closed."
"Establishment, operation and use of SIS II (regulation) - Establishment, operation and use of SIS II (decision) - Access to SIS II by the services responsible for issuing vehicle registration certificates (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Mr Coelho on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) - C6-0174/2005 -,"
"the report by Mr Coelho on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) - C6-0301/2005 - and"
"the report by Mr Coelho on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding access to the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles - C6-0175/2005 -."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Coelho, the rapporteur, for his excellent work on the legal package for the second generation Schengen Information System."
"I also take the opportunity to mention the important work that has been carried out by the Finnish Presidency to finalise the discussions on this legislative package."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have all taken a very proactive attitude in finding compromises on this very sensitive and complex dossier."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council confirmed earlier this month that this SIS tool remains an absolute priority and the Commission continues to give the highest importance to this dossier."
"SIS II will be an important tool to ensure the efficient exchange of information between the relevant authorities."
"SIS II will contribute to a higher level of security as it will have greater functionalities than the current SIS that will be better suited to the operational needs of police and other authorities."
"Moving forward with SIS II will be a decisive step in underpinning free movement, effective border controls and the ongoing fight against serious crime and terrorism."
"At the same time, better safeguards have been included: for example precise data protection rules have been introduced that should also provide for more transparency and accountability."
"I strongly hope that the Council and Parliament will agree on a first reading compromise because the legislative framework is a key element - indeed a precondition - that will allow the Commission to complete the development of SIS II and allow it to start its operational phase."
"Any further delays on the legal basis will inevitably have a negative impact on the revised timetable of SIS II, and thus on lifting the internal borders of the European Union."
"Therefore I can agree to the rapporteur's proposal and I will continue to hope for a first reading compromise in order to speed up the process of implementation."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, what we have on the table are three documents: two regulations and one decision."
"I should like to draw the Chamber's attention to five issues, the first of which is institutional, namely the absurdity of the legislative process."
"We have three different legal documents subject to two different procedures: the regulations are subject to codecision and the decision to the consultation process."
"The three documents refer to the same situation; we do not have three Schengen Information Systems, we have one, on which we are making laws using different legal systems."
"This is an absurd situation that must not be allowed to continue."
"If the European Constitution had been adopted we would not be finding ourselves in this ridiculous situation."
"This was a complex legal procedure which required everyone to work in a great spirit of cooperation."
"I should like to thank publicly the shadow rapporteurs and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I wish to thank in particular Mr Lax, Mrs Mastenbroek and Mrs Kaufmann for their invaluable help and for working under great pressure to secure an agreement at first reading."
"The second point I wish to make is that, to my mind, this is a good outcome for Europe."
"This is because we have more security, better data protection and the system has been tightened up."
"Biometric data make it easier to identify people, so that a more reliable connection can be made between the person and the identity document, which serves to strengthen security standards."
"Furthermore, alerts can be tackled more intelligently, which we call the interlinking of alerts. This enables a policeman to distinguish between a less serious crime and an act that may be linked to a criminal network or to a series of crimes that require a more sophisticated security response."
"Not only are we managing information more intelligently, we are also helping the law enforcement bodies to guarantee security more effectively."
"With the three documents on which we are about to vote, we are helping to make our external border controls more effective and movement within the Community more secure."
"Thirdly, I believe that this is a good outcome for the new Member States, which justifiably want to give their citizens the feeling that they are fully-fledged citizens with the same right to free movement as those in the rest of the Community."
"This is why we must not hold back the legislative process."
"There needs to be an agreement at first reading and once this is in place we will be in a position to adopt a legal basis by the end of 2006 as we have undertaken to do."
"Fourthly, Mr President, I feel that this is a good outcome for Parliament, because we have managed to achieve most of what we had been fighting for, of which I should like to highlight the following: Community management of the central system, under the democratic control of the European Parliament and the legal control of the Court of Justice (the creation of a Community agency within five years, established in codecision with Parliament, is provided for); the fact that there is greater harmonisation of alerts in the Schengen Information System (SIS), whereby entry into the Schengen area can be refused (the Commission is invited to submit initiatives, within three years, aimed at achieving higher levels of harmonisation); the fact that European Arrest Warrants are stored in the SIS central system; the fact that we are using biometric data as a research field only after the drafting of a report to be submitted to Parliament on which Parliament will have its say; the fact that we have clearly strengthened the rules on data protection and the rights of individuals in relation to the system, the fact that the supervision system has been strengthened at both European and national level; and the obligation to draw up reports in order to increase transparency regarding the overall functioning of the system."
"My fifth and final point, Mr President, is a remark to the Council and a vote of thanks to the Commission."
"I wish to thank the Commission, and in particular Mr Frattini, who worked closely with Parliament throughout the process and - let me stress this point - helped the Commission and Parliament to find a great deal of common ground."
"I should also like to thank the two Presidencies - of Austria and Finland - for the huge amount of work that they put into this process."
"I should particularly like to thank Mr Rajamäki, Finnish home affairs minister and current chairman of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and all his team, and a special word of thanks for the chairman of the Schengen working group."
"People worked very hard and, to my mind, achieved success, both in terms of the legal solutions that we found and the institutional undertakings that we have made; for example, the Presidency has undertaken to channel all its efforts into adopting the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar by the end of the year."
"Mr President, I should like to say, however, that the Council did not always do the right thing."
"It failed to honour the promises it made at the high-level informal trialogue in May held in Strasbourg, and this led to a major defeat for the Austrian Presidency."
"I hope that the Council does not do likewise with the compromise reached in the Brussels trialogue of 26 September."
"I say this because although we managed to reach an excellent agreement at the 26 September trialogue, 48 hours, just two days, before the vote on the compromise text at the Committee on Civil Liberties, the Council sought to open up the SIS to the secret services of the Member States on the basis of an initiative by one Member State."
"It must be said that, in terms of its actual content, this proposal makes no sense."
"We cannot, on the one hand, increase personal data protection requirements, which we did in the compromise text, and, on the other, open up access to the structures of the Member States, which by definition are not answerable, either partly or totally, to the authorities responsible for data protection."
"This paradox makes no sense."
"It is also ridiculous for procedural reasons, insofar as two days before Parliament voted on the text that had been agreed upon in the trialogue with the Presidency and Mr Frattini, attempts were being made to amend the text."
"One does not make changes to a negotiation and a compromise in 48 hours."
"Relations between the European institutions should be characterised by loyalty and good faith."
"The President of Parliament is good to his word."
"We are ready to vote on a text that we managed to reach over many months and lengthy negotiations."
"I trust that the Council will also honour its commitment and that the new second generation SIS will be up and running, at the earliest opportunity, operating effectively and efficiently, and delivering security."
"(Applause)"
"Negotiations concerning all three documents have been long drawn-out and very arduous, but we have finally reached a compromise, both within the European Parliament and, some time later, in our negotiations with the Commission and the Council."
"We are aware of the responsibility we owe to a project as demanding as the enlargement of the Schengen area, which is why we on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted the legal bases virtually unanimously - that is, with a large majority."
"I believe that the same thing will also happen when we vote at the plenary session."
"Any further procrastination in adopting the legal bases will affect the launch of SIS II."
"For this reason, the European Parliament should adopt the bases as a matter of urgency, as they clearly provide a cornerstone for the technical set-up of SIS II."
"However, how the Council will act and how the next stage of harmonisation will proceed is another question."
"It has now become clear that the enlargement of the Schengen area will be delayed for technical reasons."
"These difficulties are probably considerable."
"The new Member States, among them Slovenia, which have invested a lot of effort in meeting the Schengen criteria, have confirmed that they have fulfilled all these criteria."
"Consequently, the delay is not due to any lack of preparation on our part."
"Linked to this is the extremely serious issue of the costs we will incur as a result of the delay in acceding to the Schengen area."
"I therefore support the alternative solutions which will grant accession to SIS I only to those Member States which have finalised their preparations, that is to say, to those which have fulfilled all the criteria for inclusion in the Schengen Information System within the time limit originally envisaged."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt the afore-mentioned legal bases and I would like to thank Mr Coelho and Commissioner Frattini for their outstanding cooperation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin, of course, by thanking Mr Coelho and the groups' shadow rapporteurs for their intensive work."
"The implementation of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) should enable us to help remove the internal borders with the ten new Member States."
"Enlarging the Schengen area is a priority for our Parliament."
"We understand the difficulties faced by our Eastern European colleagues in terms of explaining to their fellow citizens why they cannot move freely within Europe."
"That is why we wanted to reach an agreement at first reading so as not to hinder the free movement of all European citizens."
"The Schengen Information System must provide us with a high level of security with which to remove the borders, but any centralised database must comply with the principles of proportionality and purpose so as to ensure that everyone's private life is protected."
"That is why we are pleased to see a direct, specific reference in this text to the future framework decision on the protection of data under the third pillar, something for which I am especially grateful to Mr Coelho."
"I hope that the Council will be able to send us its first reading of this text very soon, just as it promised to do during our last plenary session."
"The SIS is a monitoring tool that has been implemented at the external borders and that has replaced the old fixed installations, which were abolished as part of the efforts to promote the free movement of persons."
"We wanted strictly to define those authorities that would have direct access to the data."
"The list of authorities granted access will thus be published in the Official Journal, and this will help to prevent any misuse of the data by making it possible to identify by whom, when and why the data from the system were exploited."
"Furthermore, our priority is to grant people access to information about themselves, by giving them the opportunity to appeal and to correct any errors."
"We have worked together, in a spirit of compromise, in order to arrive as quickly as possible at a joint text."
"I understand the concerns of the new Member States following the Commission's announcement that there has been a delay in implementing the system."
"These are, however, technical problems in the system for which the European Parliament cannot be held responsible."
"Finally, I should like to call on the Member States not to impose any last-minute requests that might jeopardise the compromise accepted by all of the institutions, and not to further delay the adoption of this text, which is necessary from the point of view of free movement."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) In a short time, we shadow rapporteurs have joined the rapporteur in approving all the legislative proposals necessary in order to extend the Schengen area also to include the new Member States."
"I wish to extend a special thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and to the shadow rapporteurs for the splendid consensus we have achieved and for the constructive outcome of our work."
"The fly in the ointment is the timetable."
"Despite having done our utmost in order as quickly as possible to phase out internal borders, the Schengen enlargement will be delayed."
"By how long is not yet clear."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe do not think that we have had enough by way of answers from the Council and the Commission as to why there has been a delay which, moreover, threatens to go on for some time."
"Every citizen who is waiting no longer to have to pass through internal border controls is entitled to be told where the problem lies."
"We therefore propose that the Commission immediately set up an independent inquiry into the causes of the delay."
"The Schengen area is one of the EU's most successful projects."
"Abolishing internal borders is one very practical way of creating a common European identity."
"It might be said to be one of the EU's most fundamental tasks."
"During the preparations for SIS II, the introduction of biometrics - that is to say, the inclusion of fingerprints in databases - was perhaps the most controversial issue."
"The solution whereby biometrics are to be introduced in two stages is a good one."
"In the first stage, it would only be permitted to confirm a person's identity with the help of fingerprints."
"In the second stage, it would also be possible to make searches using biometric criteria."
"I am convinced that it should only be possible to use biometrics with very great care and discernment."
"In the SIS II system, their use is, however, relatively uncontroversial because the database concerned contains, for the most part, information about people sought by the authorities."
"What is, however, much more controversial is the use of fingerprints in the future common Schengen visas, which will be issued by the new Member States too."
"Here, we are concerned in most cases with tourists, relatives and business people who have never had any problems with the authorities."
"The use of biometric criteria is a much bigger issue, both technically and administratively, in the case of the visa system than it is in the case of SIS II."
"For the visas, the fingerprints of 20 million people per year are to be taken."
"Therefore, it is probably important for governments not to delay in considering the possibility of excluding fingerprints from the system, in any case at the beginning."
"Otherwise, there is a great risk of the Schengen enlargement being delayed in this important area too, and that is something that we really do not wish to see happen."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, thank you, Mr Coelho for your work on improving this proposal."
"It is important for us to enhance data protection, something that the European Parliament is trying to do."
"It is important for people to be allowed to know what information is being recorded about them, for sound reasons."
"I think that Schengen, including the Schengen Information System, has been beset by problems from the very beginning."
"In practice, we have replaced simple border controls by an ability on the part of the authorities constantly to keep a check on people when they are actually in their own countries."
"What is being proposed here is an increase in the number of authorities that have access to data."
"The proposal thus entails increased use of this data, so we have to be still more careful about the information we submit."
"For that reason, I think it inappropriate to submit biometric data."
"When the United States debated going down this road, it allowed its Supreme Court to examine the options."
"The implication for ourselves of their decision is that there would be a great risk either that many people who are entitled to enter the EU would not be able to do so, or - in the event of the safety margins being reduced - that undesirables would get in."
"There are many people - for example, hard-working people with poor fingerprints - who it would not be possible to identify with certainty using fingerprints."
"There is a danger that innocent people would be turned away and that guilty people would slip though."
"Biometric data is also extremely expensive."
"Increased use of such data is unacceptable when it is now to be possible to search for such data. Nor is it acceptable for a decision on the matter to be made through a committee procedure."
"Biometric data entails an invasion of privacy, especially as it might very well affect innocent people."
"It is not a route we should go down."
"A number of governments now wish, at the last minute, to introduce a provision whereby the security police are to have access to the data concerned."
"That would put an end to the whole principle of data protection, to the whole principle of the right to know what has been recorded about oneself and to the whole principle of legal certainty and the rule of law."
"It would be as well, I think, if the Council were to withdraw this debate from the agenda."
"The security police must not have access to such information."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, even though the primary reason why SIS II is needed is that it enables the citizens of the new Member States to avail themselves of their right to unrestricted freedom of movement within the EU, my group will nevertheless be voting against the draft legislation, and there are two reasons why we have decided to do that."
"The first has to do with data protection."
"The fact is that SIS II is not just about the free movement of persons, but also - and above all - about cooperation between police and justice authorities and a system of investigation."
"It is common knowledge, however, that the current arrangements for data protection within the third pillar are unsatisfactory."
"If citizens' rights and the requirements of security are to be kept in balance, what is needed is the framework decision on the protection of personal data."
"This is something that this House recently voted unanimously to endorse, but what is the Council doing?"
"The framework decision has not been forthcoming."
"As we have heard, there are those in the Council who still have reservations about it, and what that means in plain language is that we know, at present, neither when this framework decision is to enter into force, nor what substantial changes the Council has made to it, even though considerations of human rights make it imperative that proper data protection be guaranteed, and, moreover, even before this sort of comprehensive database is created."
"Secondly, the inclusion of biometric data is problematic, and for a variety of reasons."
"For a start, the impact of the use of biometric data in such a large system has not been assessed, and nor have the conditions for the inclusion of such data been adequately laid down."
"Another consideration is that it is not - in my group's view - acceptable that the question of when biometric data should be allowed to be used as a primary search criterion should be decided without reference to Parliament."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Coelho for the good cooperation, but, while I am on that subject, I would like to emphasise that I take an unsympathetic view of the way in which the Council - largely in response to pressure from my own country - has dealt with this House over recent days."
"It is not acceptable that new demands should be made after the conclusion of the trilogue, thereby putting a pistol to Parliament's head."
"It is made even less acceptable if one is aware of precisely why Berlin chose to try to blackmail the Council."
"By all means let the police have access to SIS II, but I have to tell the House that I do not believe that the secret services should be allowed to get their hands on it, for, as we have discovered all too often, they are accountable to themselves alone, and for that reason we should not make SIS II more accessible than it already is."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, I wish I could be delighted about the fact that the European Parliament will consider this packet of three documents in the October part-session and that we shall probably take a reasonably rapid decision, which will also mean that it will be a codecision."
"While I have a high opinion of the rapporteur's main position, which is based on the European Parliament's traditional stance, and while really important issues have been debated, together with issues which, in my view, are not important at all, such as the location of the Community's agency, we have in reality forgotten about communicating with the public and we have lost track of the time that has been spent."
"For the public in the new Member States it is difficult to understand why the technical, financial and human resources for the internal borders of the new Member States will be applied two years later than planned and why Schengen agreement rights will not be extended to citizens of the new Member States until at least 2009."
"In reality, in the eyes of citizens of the new Member States, the Schengen area is a much greater symbol of the European Union's unity than the European Union constitution."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the European Union is currently working hard at reinforcing external border control, which is important, but there are also the internal borders to consider, and incidents involving suspects crossing borders throw up questions about internal border control."
"I see Schengen as a romantic concept."
"In the European Union, it is not only innocent citizens who benefit from the free movement of persons; so did Hussein Osman, a 27-year-old who was one of those suspected in connection with the attacks in London, who was able to travel to Rome without any problems, and that cannot be what Schengen is about."
"More frequent and more targeted controls will therefore need to be put in place, not only at national borders, but also on ferries, at airports and at railway interchanges."
"This is where an effective information system such as SIS II can be useful."
"Going back to the pre-Schengen era is not an option; after all, the free movement of persons and the effective functioning of the European Union go hand in hand, and the latter is dependent on the former."
"(PL) Mr President, the Schengen Information System is a highly complex information transfer system linked to a computerised database."
"In its present form, this system is only capable of serving a maximum of 18 participating countries."
"No provision was made for extending it to include the new Member States of the Union after the enlargement."
"This was one of the reasons why it was necessary to start work on a new, second-generation information system, namely SIS II."
"The new Member States would like to join this system at the earliest opportunity."
"Initially, this was planned for October 2007 but, three weeks ago, the European Commission agreed that there would be a one-year delay."
"Commissioner Frattini stated that, at best, the new SIS II information system would be ready in June 2008."
"This is not the whole truth, because the date given only applies to the old Member States."
"The new entrants, like Poland, will be connected later, with our experts reckoning that it might not happen until the middle of 2009."
"We cannot agree to such a lengthy delay."
"We appreciate that the system needs more work, but the middle of 2009 is an unacceptable date."
"We want our nationals to feel they are fully-fledged European citizens when they travel."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Coelho and all the political groups for their serious and well thought-out work on the SIS II package."
"I agree with the rapporteur, however, that it is not acceptable for the Council to introduce amendments to the compromise already reached in the three-party talks."
"That is why, at this juncture, we should give priority to approval of the legislative package at first reading."
"The SIS II package provides increased security, better protection of personal data, and tighter border controls."
"It also increases both the freedom and the security of all citizens who live in the European Union and travel within it, not just the citizens of the new Member States."
"Of course, putting the new legislation into practice is just as important as approving it, and we therefore look forward to the debate on SIS II implementation when Commissioner Frattini is present."
"I would point out that, to date, no information has been made available to this House concerning the extent of the delay in constructing the central unit for the SIS II and the reasons for it."
"We are therefore eagerly awaiting the conclusions of the audit report on the European Commission's work on the construction of SIS II promised by Mr Kallas."
"This audit report and the forthcoming European Council summit, which will decide on the timetable for removing border controls with the new Member States, will both be good opportunities to debate an issue that is of such importance to ordinary people."
"SIS II is being created to fulfil commitments entered into at the highest political level in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Accession Treaty and the Hague Programme."
"Meeting these commitments on time is vital for the European Union's credibility."
"It will be judged on whether it can meet the obligations and deliver the specific benefits and advantages it has promised its citizens."
"Mr President, let me take this opportunity to thank Mr Coelho for his outstanding performance on this file."
"It is, after all, thanks to him and his negotiating skills that the decision-making procedure on this important and complex package of legislation has been finished in time."
"Mr Coelho was confronted with some tough choices during this process."
"Producing law at record speed is efficient, but it cannot be denied that this efficiency comes at the expense of transparency."
"My group is worried about the lack of data protection concerning the second generation of the Schengen Information System."
"The Council finally agreed to refer to the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar."
"A referral like that is the least we can do to protect our citizens' rights and we are not there yet - far from it."
"The Council initially refused the referral because the decision had not yet been taken."
"That is true, but why?"
"Is it not the Council that is putting the brakes on this issue?"
"And is it not the Council that is aiming to water down the decision, almost to the point that there is hardly anything left to protect?"
"I cannot help but mention here the German Government's offer to make data protection in the third pillar a priority during its Presidency, provided we agree to make some fundamental changes at the last minute in situ."
"Well, that leaves a bitter taste indeed, after the British Government promised to deliver if Parliament agreed with data retention and did not; after both the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies did not seem too keen on pushing the issue forward, but are nevertheless watering down the proposal."
"Yes, German Government, you will have to make this one of your priorities, but not in exchange for a favour."
"You will have to do it because citizens deserve it and they deserve it now."
"The lack of data protection makes it all the more worrisome that the Parliament is asked to give up its decision-making rights concerning biometrics."
"Again, this is all in the spirit of efficiency, but at the expense of transparency, and therefore democracy."
"So why am I proposing to vote in favour, in spite of all this criticism?"
"For many reasons. I will mention just a few."
"The citizens of Europe do not appear to be particularly worried about co- or framework decisions; they are, however, worried about the increasing number of stolen cars finding their way to eastern European Member States and would like us to take the necessary steps to fight that growing area of crime."
"In an area without internal borders, we also need to have a joint approach to illegal immigration."
"No matter how difficult this issue is for many of us, we need a common tool to deal with the presence of illegal immigrants."
"Also, the Schengen Information System will add more meaning and substance to the European arrest warrant and strengthen the role of Europol and Eurojust with the increasing cooperation of our police and security forces."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"I believe that the great mystery is this huge technical delay in preparing the SIS."
"One might well suppose that there is a political reason for the fact that the SIS, as an instrument designed to guarantee freedom of movement, is in danger of becoming more and more secondary to the requirements of security, which are, of course, legitimate requirements."
"I believe, however, that we are overstepping the mark if we want - as the German Government seems to do - to make these databases accessible to the secret services, too."
"This, together with the increasingly frequent use of biometrics are likely to be the - let us say - technically necessary result of inward-looking policies on freedom of movement and immigration."
"I therefore believe that the reason for these technical delays can only be an eminently political one."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that a worthy end - that of the free movement of EU citizens and the abolition of internal borders - is concealing an unacceptable means."
"The second generation Schengen Information System introduces new forms of social control, and the unlimited use of biometric data will in reality undermine personal data protection."
"We are concerned because, recently, these data have been misused, with a genuine form of control being exercised."
"As we have said time and again, we believe that it is unacceptable for these data to end up in the hands of the secret services."
"We are concerned because an administrative function is being turned into an instrument of police control."
"While we welcome the commendable work done by Mr Coelho, our group will therefore vote against, since we believe that, instead of debating the free movement of EU citizens, we are debating ways in which they will be completely controlled."
"(PL) Mr President, the delay in extending the Schengen area will have both political and financial implications for the new Member States."
"The political implications will involve a deepening of the divide between those who are equal and those who are more equal within the Union, just when that gap should be disappearing."
"The financial implications will be considerable, because the bulk of the costs of the delay will have to be met by the new Member Sates."
"I very much hope, therefore, that most of these costs will be met from the European Union's budget, as proposed by the eight countries in the Salzburg Forum."
"I also hope that henceforth the Commission will play fair with the new Member States."
"The Commission was aware of the scale of the delays a long time ago, but chose not to make them public."
"What is even worse is that it is planned for the old Member States to join SIS II in June 2008, but the new Member States will only be able to join in the distant future."
"They may not be able to do so until the end of 2009."
"Discriminating against the new Member States in this way is simply unacceptable."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the question is how effective the Schengen Agreement has been to date."
"Did it stop the Islamic fundamentalists in Madrid?"
"Has it stopped Islamic fanatics throughout Europe?"
"Did it stop them in London?"
"So why should we apply it when we cannot defend Europe?"
"Tell me; is there a coastguard in the Aegean?"
"Here you have not defined where the borders of Europe are."
"Two thousand people a day attempt to enter Greece and another two thousand attempt to enter Spain."
"Consequently, we are helping them."
"Once they have entered Greece, they can enter Italy, Austria, Germany or France."
"We are helping them by abolishing internal borders."
"What do we gain?"
"And now we want a second generation."
"What are we offering our citizens?"
"Agents tapping their telephones, cameras watching them, the Schengen system recording their personal data."
"We are therefore creating a democratic deficit without any corresponding benefit."
"Of course I shall be voting against this dumbing down of democracy."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate revolves around the question as to how the future, modified Schengen Information System can be utilised in a common European strategy, bearing in mind the two main challenges Europe is facing today, namely the tide of illegal immigration - the consequences of which we see from day to day - and the risk of Islam terrorism."
"That is the central question in this whole debate."
"An information system in which all countries participate and that possesses more functions than its predecessor could prove useful in the tracing and expulsion of illegal immigrants and also in the fight against terrorism."
"Such an information system was dealt a heavy blow as long ago as last year, though, when the European Court of Justice stipulated that a country cannot deny anyone access on the basis of their being flagged in the system as a danger to law and order."
"After all, the Court specified that a country must be able to decide for itself whether the person involved forms a threat."
"A deeper and more fundamental question is whether the individual Member States themselves have taken on board the Schengen logic and the spirit of the Schengen system."
"Accordingly, the legalisation of illegals, people who have entered the Schengen area illegally, is a manifest violation of the Schengen agreement."
"To put it in a nutshell, the information system must be placed in a broader framework."
"It is only useful if the Member States monitor the external borders effectively, adopt an active and consistent policy of tracing and expulsion and come down hard on human traffickers who make a fortune at external borders that are scantly monitored."
"(HU) The integration of the European Union has reached an important milestone with the vote in the European Parliament on the regulations creating the legislative basis for the second-generation Schengen Information System."
"Parliament has indicated that it will do everything in its power to ensure that the promises made in the course of enlargement are fulfilled, and that the new Member States can join the Schengen system as soon as possible."
"Thanks are due to the rapporteur, who has done everything possible for this to be achieved."
"It is precisely in order to avoid further delay that it is important for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement on first reading."
"Thus, it is strange that, while here in Parliament we are striving to establish the legal background as quickly as possible and are prepared to accept compromises, the government representatives on the Council are voting on passages that will necessarily delay the solution."
"The key question regarding the path towards lifting the internal borders under Schengen is to know when the new Member States will be able to join the Schengen Information System; according to the Commission this is causing considerable delay."
"The objection given is that SIS II has taken longer to complete than planned, but one cannot help but presume that there are political reasons for the delay, although the Commission invokes technical reasons."
"But I would like to ask, can this justify maintaining this clearly discriminatory situation?"
"Is it not irresponsible to burden the new Member States with so great a security deficit?"
"For Hungary, as for the other new Member States, one of the main challenges since accession has been to attain full Schengen membership."
"In popular opinion, this is one of the signs of the credibility of enlargement, and therefore we have to be open to any solution that can make it possible for entry into this system to take place by the planned deadline."
"The Commission, the Council, and Parliament have a great responsibility in this regard."
"(HU) We have reached an extremely important stage of a long process."
"We would like to thank everyone who took part in this process, and in particular the rapporteur."
"Nevertheless, the current situation is not an entirely happy one for us, since it seems that a multilevel membership is emerging within the Union, which we consider unacceptable."
"It is not certain that the new Member States will be able to join the Schengen system in October 2007, although the lifting of internal borders is one of the most important achievements of the European Union, especially for the citizens of those Member States who during the days of dictatorship were either unable to travel to the 'old' Member States, or could do so only under excessively severe restrictions."
"The opening of the borders under Schengen on the one hand strengthens a sense of belonging to a single community on the part of new EU citizens, and on the other hand can increase the confidence of the old Member States in the new ones."
"For this reason, the question of what we can join and when is far from insignificant."
"The delay officially recognised by the Commission comes as a shock to us."
"We know that adequate guarantees for the security of the new system are necessary, yet the opening of the borders is also a moral question for the new Member States."
"There are others who share our view, as we can see in the Portuguese proposal."
"As an MEP from a new Member State, I have mixed feelings."
"I am glad that there is solidarity among Member States, but I regret that for the moment our joining SIS I is not yet certain."
"What is certain is that everything that lies ahead will involve budget overruns."
"(EL) Mr President, the second generation Schengen Information System is an enhanced version of the database used to record the data of the citizens of the European Union and of third countries on the pretext of safeguarding public order within the European Union."
"When we talk about the second generation Schengen Information System, we need to be clear."
"We are not simply talking about a technical aid which will help the Union to function better; we are talking about an institution of strategic importance, through which the forces of repression will acquire a politically enhanced role in order to combat terrorism and manage immigration, without any importance attached to data protection and without ensuring that data will not be passed to third countries."
"In fact, exactly the opposite is happening, given that the Union has endorsed the facility to transfer our personal data to the secret services of third countries, such as the USA, via Europol and Eurojust."
"We are therefore all potential terrorists, or perhaps the new order is, at the same time, imposing a new legal order, in which our freedoms must first be sifted by the secret services and then granted to us?"
"And this is supposed not to worry us."
"- (LT) I would first like to thank Mr Coelho, who mentioned at our session today that the SIS II system is very useful for the new EU Member States that planned to join the Schengen area in autumn 2007."
"I would like to note that my country, Lithuania, was very earnest in its preparations for Schengen membership, as was confirmed by a recent inspection of readiness to join Schengen area by European Commission experts."
"After all, the free movement of persons, which would be ensured by the enlargement of Schengen, is one of the key freedoms on which the European Union is based."
"Unfortunately, we have recently been informed that Schengen enlargement will be delayed for technical reasons because the preparatory work for the second generation of the Schengen Information System SIS II will not be completed on time."
"I fully agree with the ideas voiced by the rapporteur and would like to note that we should urge the Commission to present exhaustive and transparent information and findings of investigations to Parliament, specifying how the main SIS II project is being implemented, including the reasons for the delay."
"We should also urge the Commission and the Council to take steps to enable compliance with the original date for new EU Member States to join Schengen."
"If this is not possible, we must encourage the Commission to present a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the delay, specifying the resources necessary to cover the financial and organisational costs deriving from the development and implementation of SIS II and the liability for such costs."
"(EL) Mr President, with Schengen ΙΙ we are not, for better or for worse, reinventing the wheel."
"We already have the Schengen area in Europe for freedom of movement and security."
"We owed solidarity to the new Member States and we owed solidarity, which we are granting in this way, given that the Commission has announced that the system will not be ready for several years."
"However, with Schengen ΙΙ we also need to ensure that fundamental rights will be better protected than under Schengen Ι. Thanks to the amendments by the European Parliament, Schengen ΙΙ contains more detailed rules on data protection, makes provision for Community control of and responsibility for the functioning of the system, controls by the European Parliament and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, bans access to third countries and makes provision for active control by the European Data Protection Supervisor and greater transparency."
"At the same time, however, the ministers are unfortunately persistent in their refusal to harmonise the alerts system."
"What does 'clear indications that someone has committed a serious criminal offence' mean?"
"We are talking here of the possibility of arbitrary action by over-zealous police officers."
"Fortunately, the Commission will try to harmonise it in three years, but you will need to work on this, Commissioner Frattini."
"Finally, there is no data protection under the third pillar."
"The Council promised Parliament that it would do this, but it did not."
"Are we deluding ourselves?"
"We are passing a measure here which, for the police and other authorities, concerns exchanges of private data, and yet the Council refuses to bring in this data protection measure, putting pressure on us instead to adopt this proposal."
"I thank you, Mr President, but you can be sure that, if we do not have this framework decision immediately, Parliament's voice will be heard loud and clear."
"- (SK) Over the past few days, doubts concerning the original deadline for accession to the Schengen area in October 2007 have become a focus of mass media attention in the new Member States."
"Compliance with the deadline is conditional on the deployment of the new generation Schengen Information System, SIS II."
"In this regard I consider Mr Coelho's three reports to be very important."
"I would like to praise his work, including the amendments designed to make the Commission's proposal more transparent and to ensure that the Council adopts the consensus in the first reading."
"Even though these three reports to a large extent focus on technical matters rather than on the frequently discussed Schengen area enlargement date, their smooth passage and implementation will determine the conditions under which the 2007 deadline might be still feasible."
"A delay in deploying the Schengen system would certainly increase the final cost of completing it."
"In the case of Slovakia alone it has so far entailed about EUR 6 million."
"For this reason we find any delay unacceptable."
"In the Hague Programme of 5 November 2004 the European Council called on the Council, European Commission and Member States to take all possible steps to lift border checks on the European Union's internal borders as soon as possible."
"Almost two years have elapsed since then, and the citizens of the Member States cannot understand the European Commission is only now tackling the technical and legal problems associated with implementing SIS II."
"In conclusion I would like to call for consensus and for this legislation to be adopted in Parliament at first reading in order to ensure that the European Union does not lose credibility in the eyes of its citizens because of ineffective bureaucracy."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Coelho and others for their constructive work."
"Those of us from the countries that have been able to participate in SIS have seen the 'wanted' register produce immediate results in our efforts to combat crime that knows no frontiers and that moves from one EU country to another."
"We are looking forward to a more developed SIS II system in which all 25, and soon all 27, countries can participate."
"In the reports made accessible to citizens, this cooperation has given us both an instrument for preventing people with previous convictions from returning and a tool in the fight against drugs."
"We have also obtained a tool in the fight against people-traffickers, who not only smuggle in children and consign them to prostitution but also consign them to exploitation as a labour force."
"Once SIS II has been extended and brought into operation, we shall be able to supply Europeans with effective proof of our cooperation."
"This also means, however, that we must do more work both on combating crime and on protecting personal privacy."
"Dialogue is required if we are to be able to meet the expectations that people have of us in the general debate on peace, security and justice as the basis for all the work we do."
"Is it not possible for such dialogue to take place more quickly, however?"
"(PL) Mr President, the citizens of the old European Union have enjoyed freedom of movement within the Schengen system since 1985."
"Following enlargement, however, the system has been unable to cope with the citizens of the new Member States."
"So, if these people wish to cross a border they are still subjected to checks, and required to spend long hours queuing patiently at crossing points."
"The time has surely come to put an end to this divide between the old and the new EU, whereby the citizens of the old and 'better' European Union can enjoy the freedom of movement laid down in the Treaties, whilst for the citizens of the new and 'worse' countries time has stood still since 1985."
"It seems paradoxical that although FRONTEX, the agency charged with protecting the EU's external borders, is located in Warsaw in a new Member State, Poles and citizens of other nations remain deprived of full freedom of movement within the European Union."
"I therefore call on this House to adopt the three reports debated today at first reading."
"We have to eliminate this tangible border which is perceived as a great wall that continues to divide the old from the new European Union."
"It is our duty to get rid of it."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank all the Members who have expressed solidarity with the new Member States today."
"(ET) As the representative of a new Member State, I am very glad that the second generation of the Schengen Information System is nearing completion."
"The problem, however, is that the completion of the information system has been delayed."
"Whereas in June the Council confirmed that everything was under control and that the deadline would not change, two months later the situation was different."
"Today it is apparently clear to everyone that the expansion of Schengen will be delayed, but it is not clear exactly how long this delay will be."
"I believe it would be better for all parties if an honest answer were given to all those concerned as to when accession will take place."
"The new Member States have made a strong effort, and this must continue."
"We have problems in Estonia too."
"Our homework would, however, be much more effective if there were certainty concerning the future."
"Freedom of movement is not the only issue; there is also the fact that the uncertain situation creates mutual distrust."
"How does the Commission plan to act in this situation, and what would the deadlines be?"
"This is a very important question today."
"Mr President, after months of heavy negotiating, two and a half minutes is simply not enough time in which to enlighten this Parliament with my vision."
"I am going to finish my speech if that is OK with you."
"It is now up to the European Commission and the relevant organisations within the Member States to make this new system perform in the best interest of our citizens."
"I want to call on the European Parliament here, however, to do some serious soul-searching about why we so often insist on having codecision, only to give it up again as soon as we can actually use it, and about our flip-flopping attitude concerning data protection."
"We will not prove the added value of the European Parliament to citizens by fighting for rights alone."
"We will prove that only by using them to society's benefit."
"(PL) Mr President, Schengen is one of those EU projects that enables the citizens of the Member States to appreciate the benefits of belonging to the European Union."
"It makes travelling easier, helps with border control and also means crime can be dealt with more effectively."
"Parliament is keeping to its word and timetable, but the Commission is sadly lacking in this regard."
"It is still not clear when the new Member States will be able to join the enlarged system."
"The SIS I Plus proposal actually amounts to a step backwards, as it involves applying a different timeframe to the countries of the old and new European Union."
"Along with other Central European countries, Poland implemented costly and politically difficult requirements in respect of its Eastern neighbours back in 2003."
"I shall be interested to know how Commissioner Frattini intends to explain to Polish, Czech, and Hungarian public opinion that the entry of our countries into the Schengen area has been delayed, possibly until 2009."
"I shall also be interested to know whether the specific reasons for this delay will ever be divulged to us."
"It may well be that too many central EU institutions are located in Strasbourg and that it therefore cannot cope."
"But it may be that this situation is the result not of technical problems with the introduction of SIS II, but of the political reluctance of certain Member States to implement the Treaty in their domestic policy."
"I shall be unable to rid myself of such nagging suspicions until I receive a response to these questions."
"Mr President, I believe that the majority of the speakers have mentioned the major problems faced by the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), and that a minority of them mentioned the legal basis."
"I am therefore going to speak about the legal basis and about the major problems that the functionality of the system has brought up, but before doing so, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for having worked closely not only with the Council, but also with the European Commission, with the aim of reaching a satisfactory compromise on the legal basis about which I shall say a few words in a moment's time."
"Several of you spoke about the delay in implementing the second generation system."
"I will, as ever, be frank with you: I believe that the game that consists in constantly looking for someone on whom to pin the blame, instead of resolving the problem, is not helpful."
"Why?"
"Because the Member States, and especially those represented by the speakers who have taken the floor in this House, know only too well what has caused this delay."
"The Member States have already examined on several occasions the revised time-limits for implementation, which will be submitted for approval at the December Council."
"One of you spoke about 2009."
"I cannot guarantee that final approval will be given by the December Council, but the Commission proposal's target date for the entry into operation of a second generation system is not 2009, but indeed June 2008."
"As for the delays - I repeat - they are linked to the purely technical problems relating to the functioning of the sites."
"Thus the central site, installed in Strasbourg, where we are, has experienced some delays."
"However, these delays are also linked to contractual procedures in several Member States, especially in the new Member States."
"Furthermore, virtually all, or, at any rate, a great majority, of the Member States have requested more time in order to test the technical connections linking their national systems to the central site."
"It is the Member States that have requested an additional three-month extension, not the Council or the European Commission."
"The Council and the Commission have committed themselves to limiting the delay, and even to making up for the time lost."
"I can tell you that a working group, working alongside the Commission and the Member States, has been set up in order to oversee the implementation of the revised plan that I proposed and that the Member States have examined and are going to approve in December."
"We are in the process of evaluating some temporary solutions."
"Thus, Portugal's proposal, which has been called SIS Plus, is only a temporary solution in terms of reducing the time limit and can under no circumstances constitute an alternative to the SIS II system."
"I could also take account - and I am saying so here in this Parliament - of the financial impact of the delay on the new Member States."
"I am saying this and I am confirming it, but on one condition: that the Member States making the requests are not themselves lagging behind in terms, for example, of contractual procedures."
"Furthermore, I can tell you, in all honesty, that, to date, Slovenia is the only country technically able to meet the initial deadline of October 2007."
"I should like to say a few words now about the legal basis."
"With regard to the proposal submitted to Parliament, I can say, just as Mr Coelho himself quite rightly said, that this is a good result for the European Union."
"The controls carried out by the police authorities will be made more effective, with the result that the external borders will be more secure and an appropriate level of protection of personal data will also be maintained."
"Frankly, I hope, like several of you do, that the Council will finally act on the political commitment made by the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies, and by that I mean the agreement on the proposal for a framework directive aimed at integrating data protection into the third pillar so as to create a comprehensive system incorporating security and the protection of fundamental rights."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have shown that they are capable of working together to reach a balanced compromise."
"The new Member States are rightly calling for the controls at their external borders to be lifted."
"The fact that we are acting fairly swiftly in guaranteeing all EU citizens a real area of free movement is one of the most visible results of EU enlargement."
"Finally, any delay due to the legal basis is going to affect this major political result for Europe, which was a priority objective in the accession treaty."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30."
"Women's immigration (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women's immigration: the role and place of immigrant women in the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I had the honour of drafting on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is designed to help broaden the debate and our political action on the question of immigration by introducing the parameter of women's immigration."
"This parameter is becoming more and more important given that, in the enlarged European Union, there is a constant increase in women from various areas of the world who are immigrating either in isolation, as independent economic migrants, or within the framework of the migration of their families or for other reasons, accounting for approximately 54% of all immigrants, although this is not an exact figure."
"We all realise today that our objectives for development and social cohesion are directly linked to the management of migration flows, by ensuring that immigrants are valued and integrated into our communities."
"As such, the 'femalisation' - if you will permit the phrase - of immigration is a new challenge which must be studied and taken into account in all our policies."
"Female immigrants, either at a personal level or as members of their families, can constitute added value both for our communities and for their communities of origin."
"In our report, reference is made to the problems faced by female immigrants."
"These problems have to do with the discrimination which they suffer on the labour market and in education and, more specifically, with the recognition of their qualifications and vocational skills and they are problems which result in unemployment and poverty."
"Reference is also made to cases of violation of human rights, such as violence and sexual exploitation, which are matters which we have repeatedly debated and condemned in the European Parliament."
"We also wish to shed light on the problems faced by women in certain immigrant communities, in which they are the victims of cultural and religious stereotypes, resulting in their marginalisation."
"Even worse are the cases of forced marriages and crimes of honour."
"The basic thrust of our report and the resolution which we propose is, on the one hand, the protection of the rights of immigrants and, on the other hand, their improved integration into the labour market and social life."
"This means, first of all, the application of the acquis communautaire in order to remove discrimination, prevent trafficking and make provision for family reunification and the rights of women as accompanying family members."
"The report recognises the right of the Member States to decide on the numbers and rules under which they accept immigrants into their country."
"Within this framework of national legislation, therefore, we support respect for the rights of women, their family rights and, more importantly, the rights of children, in accordance with international conventions and protocols."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we recognise that integration is a complex and two-way process."
"Therefore, alongside this framework of reception and respect for the rights of immigrants, which we must apply with proper coordination and use of all our policies, we must cooperate seriously with the countries of origin and the immigrant communities in our countries so that we can prepare the proper integration of immigrants and, more importantly, of female immigrants, because they are the ones who know least of all about their rights and about the benefits and obligations which derive from those rights."
"These have to do with language, with the authorities, with our values, with the potential for vocational careers and with the potential to participate in the educational system of their children."
"Thus our objectives for development and prosperity and our fight for solidarity, justice throughout the world and the protection of human rights will be better achieved."
"My warmest thanks to all the political groups whose participation enriched my work and helped us to prepare a text which is cohesive, respects subsidiarity and the Community and international legal acquis and includes a courageous and in-depth approach to the real problems and the real challenges."
"Mr President, I must truly congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"I broadly agree with her remarks, firstly as regards access to the labour market."
"I believe that the role of women can represent one of the factors contributing to the creation, in Europe, of a genuinely balanced and comprehensive development and employment policy."
"As you will know, this is one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and it is primarily a means of guaranteeing women a full role within society and a genuine life of independence, and I therefore fully support the emphasis laid on the theme of employment."
"I also support the emphasis laid on the theme of the integration of immigrant women, firstly as regards language learning."
"Learning the language of one's country of residence must be a fundamental part of everyone's integration, be they men, women, children or babies."
"In particular, as regards women immigrants, we note that there has been a delay in guaranteeing them genuine access to the languages spoken in their host countries, and that is a factor that slows down and hinders integration."
"As the rapporteur rightly points out, the theme of integration is connected to the crucial dialogue between cultures and religions."
"I believe that the European Union is based on absolute values in terms of respect for the dignity of every woman and every man, and that it is therefore impossible to accept, under any circumstances, acts that demean human dignity, in this case women's dignity, as they are the polar opposite of symbols of integration."
"I am concerned about cases in which, for example, women are made, against their own will, to wear submissive symbols of their female status, such as veils that completely cover their faces and do not allow them to be seen."
"Unfortunately, these are symbols that sit uncomfortably with integration and suggest the subjection of women."
"I also think it absurd that, in some European countries, so-called honour crimes, or, as I would instead call them, 'dishonour crimes' take place, and I will, of course, be doing even more to promote initiatives aimed at abolishing these crimes."
"In my view, they must be treated harshly, not lightly, because, with motives like these, they attack absolute values such as human life, physical integrity and dignity."
"When applying the European directive on family reunification, we intend to pay special attention to the prevention of forced marriages."
"This is another theme on which I shall be working. As you know, this is a binding directive for the Member States."
"When applying the directive at national level, I shall pay special attention to forms of violence within the family, such as forced and polygamous marriages - which are not permitted by the laws of the European Union and of the Member States - and to the guarantees made to women in the event of separation or divorce, so that they cannot be singled out as second-class citizens when their marriages break down."
"With regard to the directives on asylum seekers and refugees, I believe that one aspect needs to be highlighted."
"For the first time, discrimination against women must be made to count as sufficient grounds for obtaining refugee status."
"I believe that being subjected to violence within the family and to female genital mutilation, or being at risk of being subjected to a forced marriage, is enough of a reason for women who demonstrate that they are exposed to such risks to be granted 'refugee' status."
"Finally, in all sincerity, once again, I should like to point out to the rapporteur an aspect on which I harbour some doubts, namely granting illegal woman immigrants exactly the same status as legal women immigrants."
"I believe that there is an area in which absolute rights must be guaranteed to everyone, without any difference in status."
"It is clear that people cannot be denied rights to health care, emergency medical treatment and a minimum level of subsistence just because, for a given period of time - perhaps while they are waiting to be repatriated - they reside in a country illegally."
"There is certainly a basis of rights that they have in common, but I believe that we should not go beyond that and mix up the two levels."
"There is illegal immigrant status, which is regulated and dealt with in one way."
"Legal immigrant status is different."
"To put them both on exactly the same footing sends out a dangerous message, and it is obviously on this point that we are working, in order to achieve a balanced European policy both on illegal immigration and on legal immigration."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I gladly take the floor to endorse Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report, even though I do so with a touch of sadness, since, last weekend, we received a further tragic piece of news in relation to women, namely the stoning to death of a woman in Baghdad, on Saturday 21 October."
"I believe that everyone is aware of the fact that it is only by women having equal dignity throughout the world that a change can occur, too, in the major problems facing the world today."
"It was in this frame of mind and with this firm belief, that is to say with a firm belief in the value and the role that women can have now and in the future in enabling this world to move towards a solution of peaceful coexistence, that I welcomed the work done by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in which consideration is given above all to the fact that women migrants are a somewhat special case."
"We would prefer it if this were not the case, but it is."
"In a world in which the division is still so clear-cut - and for a large part of the world there is still a division in terms of rights and duties - I believe that treating women and men migrants in the same way would probably be a mistake, just as it is always a mistake to treat different circumstances identically."
"The Union therefore needs to pay special attention to women's immigration, also taking account of implications that do not, in contrast, characterise men's immigration."
"I believe that we can find this focus in Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report, which I accordingly intend to support."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like sincerely to thank Mrs Kratsa for her commitment and her sense of cooperation."
"This own-initiative report is, in my view, one of the most important reports dealing with women's rights that we have had to express an opinion on since the start of the Parliamentary term."
"The situation of women migrants has been overlooked for too long by our governments, despite the fact that they are growing in number and that they now account for the majority of the people arriving on EU soil."
"They are the ones who forge the first links between their families and nationals in terms of society and integration."
"Indeed, this report offers many guidelines aimed at putting a stop to the two forms of discrimination - racial and sexual discrimination - that these women often suffer."
"I am particularly delighted that a number of provisions have been included in this report that concern illegal women immigrants, because they represent a sub-category that is deprived of its rights and thus made all the more vulnerable."
"It is therefore vital that these women can benefit, in whichever Member State they are resident, from basic rights such as access to emergency health care, legal aid and schools for their children, as is the case in my country."
"Finally, I am delighted that this report features another point to which I am particularly attached, namely the status of women who arrive on EU territory within the context of the family reunification process."
"These women often only exist in law through their husbands and are therefore placed in a situation of complete dependence."
"This report calls for them to be granted an independent and autonomous status as quickly as possible and, above all, for this status to be automatically preserved in the event of the couple separating."
"I therefore hope that this report will be adopted by a large majority within our Parliament and that the ambitious proposals that it contains will not go unheeded."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou - for which I am grateful - puts plenty wind in the sails of women's rights, particularly the rights of women immigrants, and that was long overdue."
"We have for too long taken an attitude of cultural relativism towards women immigrants for granted."
"I am glad to see that the report incorporates many of the things we have been pressing for, such as the requirement that instances of genital mutilation be reported and that there be penalties, if necessary under criminal law for forced marriages, which have been long overdue."
"I hope we will also be able to get language courses for migrant women made compulsory, for language is an important component in integration and, without them, they will be unable to avail themselves of their rights."
"We must put a stop to the situation in which girls from families that have migrated to Europe are exempted sex education classes and sports, which are mandatory for others, and in which some of them are even taken out of school or forbidden to go there."
"We need to be very determined about this and speak out about it loud and clear."
"We also see it as very important that women should acquire a legal status independent of that of their husbands, and it is on this point that I would like to address Commissioner Frattini personally, for I recently, in a written question, asked to be informed as to whether he shared my concern about the series of court rulings in various Member States that, in the way in which they accord state benefits, effectively endorse polygamy."
"I was quite horrified to be told, by a Commissioner with responsibility for justice matters, that the object of polygamy was the protection of women."
"Bigamy is prohibited in Europe, and I would welcome an answer from the Commissioner, for I cannot imagine that he would knowingly allow it to be stated that polygamy was intended to protect women, whilst certain forms of same-sex partnership are outlawed."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really am very grateful to Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her wide-ranging report, which we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left fully endorse, and adds a great deal to the information available on the rights of women migrants in the EU."
"Knowing as we do that women now constitute 54% of all immigrants, it is quite utterly incomprehensible and shocking that the attitude of European governments towards them should betray such ignorance and that they should be doing so little to meet the specific needs that women immigrants have."
"My particular concern is that we should take this opportunity to note the flagrant deficiencies in the Member States' integration policies, with women immigrants being expected to adapt to the system in silence and without difficulty, not making any demands and allowing the national labour market to make the maximum possible profit out of them."
"When countries spend decades averting their eyes from the challenges that immigrants present and then make them carry the can for their inadequate integration, I see that as no more than further evidence of ignorance and political blindness."
"I want to see gender-specific migration management that will be consistent in taking seriously immigrant women's rights to education, health, safety and independence and in ensuring that those things are available to more and more of them."
"If that is not done, we risk a further increase in the trafficking of women, in the exploitation of female domestic staff, in the social isolation of women and in domestic violence."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done, and in particular on the fact that she has highlighted some important priorities enabling us to ensure that immigration is primarily understood as two-way integration - therefore involving social, linguistic and cultural aspects - that is to say integration based on mutual respect for rights and duties."
"Among the main rights that must be guaranteed to women migrants is that of preventing and combating honour crimes, forced marriages, genital mutilation or any other form of violent constraint and exploitation."
"In this regard, I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an amendment highlighting the need to carry out extensive information campaigns aimed precisely at women migrants, so that they can be informed of their rights and of the bodies that they can turn in times of need."
"Finally, the European Union needs at last to adopt specific provisions to encourage the Member States, too, to draft laws explicitly prohibiting some of the crimes and issues about which we have already spoken."
"To conclude, I should like to thank Mr Frattini for the commitment that he has emphasised this evening, too, a commitment that the Commission intends to put to use in addressing these problems."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the very serious problem of emigration, particularly by women, due to increasing globalisation and the complexities of contemporary life should also be considered from the point of view of the irreparable damage to their countries of origin."
"In addition I must mention the problem of increasing poverty in countries exploited by rich and highly developed ones."
"There are certainly ways in which the opportunity to leave one's homeland can prove positive."
"Nonetheless, emigrants are cut off from a community bound together by its history, traditions and culture."
"An individual who could have contributed to increasing the common good leaves."
"When that person starts life all over again in a foreign culture and language, he or she is working for the benefit of another society."
"Such people are often exploited because of their circumstances."
"That is why it is vital to have the relevant legislation in place, particularly regarding social protection and the individual's right to work."
"The document under debate goes some way towards emphasising this."
"An appropriate scale of values is also important, where moral values are also given a place alongside purely material gain, and human labour is considered in the broader sense of the word, although the latter should not mean interference in the personal lives of women who want to have children and bring up families."
"(ES) Mr President, emigration is necessary and it also enriches our society in cultural, economic and social terms, and we are not going to deny that today."
"It is the case, however, that it can cause us problems if we do not manage it properly."
"It should never be a problem, because we must ensure that it is not one when we draw up these laws in all of the parliaments of the European Union."
"If the parliaments are not careful, however, they may cause problems that turn into xenophobia and racism in our societies, and that is precisely what we must prevent."
"A mistake has been made in drawing up this report, since it has not just dealt with legal emigration, but has treated legal and illegal emigration on the same footing."
"This is a dangerous message, because some of the things that this report says may have certain mafia gangs rubbing their hands with glee."
"Democracy, which is the system that fortunately governs all of us, is based on the freedom of the individual, and that is guaranteed through respect for the law, both the laws of the Member States - because this problem is subject to subsidiarity - and the Regulations and Directives that we have now and in the future."
"The important thing is respect for the law."
"I fear that some of the amendments presented by the radical left do not respect the law of the Member States and run counter to equality, democracy and the freedom of the individual."
"I would therefore ask the House to think hard about these amendments, which are designed to attract mafias, to confuse emigrants and to attract more illegal immigration."
"They are going to be of little use to emigrants and European citizens as a whole, given the draw effects, given the comings and goings and dealings of mafias and given the fact that the criteria for granting residents' permits are not clear."
"I would like to make an appeal to this House and the Commission with regard to cases of mutilation or forced marriage."
"When it comes to talking to third countries and giving them money for cooperation, we must - if we genuinely want to protect women and women's equality - demand of those countries, before giving them that money, that they respect minimum fundamental rights."
"(PT) I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou."
"We agree that European immigration policy must encompass the gender dimension and the situation of women in the Member States, because they suffer from twofold discrimination: sexual and ethnic, as has been mentioned by previous speakers."
"What is more, they suffer from discrimination both in the host society and within their own community."
"The involvement of immigrant women in all areas of the host country's social life is a vital factor in making them less isolated and in enabling them to help the younger generations to integrate."
"For this to happen, a number of barriers need to come down, beginning with the linguistic barrier."
"In some immigrant communities, not only are women marginalised, they are also forced into marriages and subjected to humiliating and cruel practices, such as genital mutilation. They also fall victim to honour crimes, as Mr Frattini mentioned."
"The Member States have a duty to do all they can to put an end to these criminal practices, victims of which have justifiable grounds for being granted asylum."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her characteristic sensitivity and for the positive proposals on the role and status of both legal and illegal immigrant women in the European Union."
"We are concerned here with women migrants who are discriminated against in the workplace, physically and mentally violated, used as commodities for sex trafficking, deprived of their freedom and passports, held to ransom by patriarchal customs and killed in honour crimes."
"I should, however, like to point out to us all that, in reality, these women are used and exploited by European families and European businessmen."
"They are very often alone, with the pain of having left behind their children in their countries of origin."
"They work as carers, alleviating the suffering and the loneliness of the elderly and the sick, and they do not have any security."
"I believe that we need to do a great deal in relation to this issue."
"These women represent a high percentage of the immigrant base and a major resource for the countries of Europe."
"They are not just victims; these women are all different and, in recent years, they have organised themselves into associations, sought to establish relations and put themselves in touch with women from their host countries. These women are requesting access to information, health care and housing."
"They want to have control over their lives, and we must help them."
"That is why we must mainstream the fight against discrimination and apply in every Member State the directives that the European Union has provided itself with - and about which Mr Frattini was also speaking - from the reception of migrants up to and including active citizenship."
"The experiences of women migrants and their criticism of inequality are helping to pave the way for establishing democracy in relation to the few differences that exist."
"(PL) Mr President, we are currently witnessing mass migration which has a variety of causes."
"There is economic migration, where the aim is to earn more and improve one's standard of living."
"That is the most common type of migration."
"Then there is migration to reunify a family or to escape from persecution in the country of origin."
"Technological development has meant that it is becoming ever easier and cheaper to travel in today's world, so the problem of immigration can only increase."
"It is therefore incumbent on us to take appropriate measures to deal with the growing number of new arrivals, particularly in Europe."
"The sensible long-term solution would be to avoid discriminating against foreigners, especially against women who are in the majority."
"Too many immigrants are being consigned to the margins of society at present."
"The Member States should create better conditions for immigrants to integrate into our societies, whilst still retaining a pride in their origins."
"This would allow us to pre-empt the problem of alienating immigrants, which leads to frustration and sometimes to violent disturbances, and very often results in a life of poverty."
"- (SK) The Commission's communication about the demographic future of Europe notes that over the next five decades the working-age population of the Member States will decline dramatically, by an estimated 48 million people."
"Even an optimistic scenario involving a resumption of demographic growth and the discovery of new sources of productivity would still leave Europe needing a major inflow of new migrants, estimated at 40 million people."
"This may be the most serious challenge facing the European Union."
"The report we have before us, for which I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, indicates that the position of migrant women plays a crucial role in the process."
"This group of women deserves special attention, not only because they are frequent targets of discrimination but also because they have a key mission in facilitating the integration of the first and second generations of migrants; therefore, the access of such women to education is of fundamental importance."
"Against the backdrop of these challenges, the need to develop common procedures for integrating migrants, and to devise common procedures over immigration policy appears both urgent and unavoidable."
"The diverging approaches adopted by the individual states give rise to unnecessary confusion."
"Developments in the area of human trafficking and human smuggling also point to a pressing need for clear immigration policies, for transparency, for unequivocal rules and for access to the common labour market."
"A lack of legitimate opportunities clearly encourages illegal activities, with illegal migrants being greatly exposed to all sorts of human rights violations and left without the assistance to which they would otherwise be entitled as victims."
"In our future deliberations, however, it is essential to make a clear distinction between asylum policy, legitimate migration and illegal migration."
"Confusing these notions would generate new and unnecessary misunderstandings."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important and highly relevant report."
"The nature of immigration into Europe has undergone a change."
"Today, more women than men come to Europe, as there is a great demand for workers in the operational service and healthcare sector."
"However, the labour market in question is also characterised by a large grey economy in which the normal rules for pay, working hours and the working environment do not apply."
"Women therefore find themselves in a very vulnerable situation without social and economic protection, and many of them perform jobs that do not provide the opportunity of becoming legal."
"Their vulnerability puts these illegal women immigrants at greater risk of being abused, both physically and mentally, while their illegal status in itself makes them easy prey for those who wish to abuse them and sexually exploit them in the workplace."
"They are also particularly at risk of being denied their fundamental rights, and they become victims of violence and discrimination in their everyday lives."
"Many do not dare report assaults for fear of deportation."
"It is absolutely imperative to place the conditions in which immigrant women find themselves more firmly in the spotlight."
"We need to ensure that the Member States take account, through their legislation, of the problems facing immigrant women."
"Those women who are victims of people-trafficking or who are exposed to violence should be given the opportunity of being granted temporary residence permits and have the right to legal aid and access to healthcare and social services, irrespective of whether or not they have a legal right to stay in the country in question."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report, and in this regard I would like to point out, in agreement with her, that the implementation in the Union of the directive on family reunification is unsatisfactory and that there is a need to amend the directive with the aim of reducing the time it takes to obtain autonomous status for spouses, almost always wives, and of guaranteeing that spouses' status will be maintained in the event of separation, divorce or widowhood."
"In addition, I would like to emphasise the importance of several instruments of Community intervention, in particular the Daphne programme, since these instruments fill in the gaps in national policies, which are all too often lacking with regard to the gender dimension in both policy content and data collection."
"Finally, the report calls for the risk of female genital mutilation to be included as grounds for requesting asylum."
"I agree with this, but I believe that now is the time to include as grounds for requesting asylum other factors involving the repression of female sexuality, such as homosexuality and so-called adulterous behaviour, for countries in which these acts carry violent punishments."
"I am thinking, in this regard, of stoning to death in Iran."
"(NL) Mr President, migrant women as a group, vulnerable though it is, are not so much a problem as an opportunity."
"They are vulnerable because they may be exposed to discrimination, not only for being women, but also on the basis of their being Muslim, Somali or Moroccan."
"They are also vulnerable to domestic violence, or because they do not speak the local language, or are financially dependent on their spouses or fathers."
"We must therefore support them by not letting domestic violence and honour crimes go unpunished, but that cannot be done by imposing stricter rules alone."
"Rights on paper are not sufficient for women; they must also be able to assert them in practice, because a woman who is dependent on the perpetrator of domestic violence will, in practice, not benefit a great deal from her rights on paper."
"That is why we must promote the financial independence of migrant women by, for example, counteracting discrimination within the labour market."
"The economy benefits when more migrant women participate in the labour market."
"Another opportunity we cannot afford to miss is the positive impact migrant women can have on the integration of their children in the new society."
"That is why, as a host community, we must be open to support of, and contact with, migrant women, for they, too, belong here."
"I am pleased that Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou deals with these aspects at great length in her excellent report, and I should therefore like to thank her for it."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and emphasise one consideration."
"Any immigration policy must surely take account of specific gender issues, but also the differences between immigrant communities, since the causes of the double discrimination suffered by immigrant women and the problems resulting from it differ according to their reasons for emigrating."
"If women emigrating alone for economic reasons find work, it is usually low-level work, sometimes in undeclared jobs, which gives them neither the independence nor the security they were seeking, though it allows them to relate to people and to integrate further."
"Nevertheless, women emigrating for the purposes of family reunification usually stay at home, with no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the host society or to learn the language, and that hinders their integration and increases their isolation."
"The designation of 2007 as 'European year of equal opportunities for all' and of 2008 as 'European year of intercultural dialogue' must help to increase citizens' awareness of the situation of immigrant women, one that is always tough but which varies in nature, and to implement policies to promote equality and integration in accordance with each different situation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make just a brief observation after having listened to many speeches which I endorse."
"First, Mrs Breyer, I would like to tell you that I have always considered and will always consider polygamous marriage to be against the law and a serious violation of the right of women to choose freely."
"I can therefore confirm to you that I will continue to move in this direction."
"Some of the Members who have spoken - Mrs Angelilli and Mrs Morgantini - have raised the issue of communication."
"I believe - if I may say so - that giving a voice to immigrant women in a more direct and stronger way can be of great help, even in drawing up stronger European defence policies."
"'Giving a voice' means allowing these people to have effective means at their disposal to be able to speak and to be listened to."
"Otherwise, there is a risk - if I may say so - that the voices of these women may also be subject to a filter operated by the communities in which they reside."
"In many European countries cases of personal segregation and submission of immigrant women have been observed."
"This is the group, among the many with which I work, from which I receive the lowest number of individual complaints."
"When compared with other sectors connected with the protection of people's fundamental rights, individual violence against women in immigrant communities is the area in which the fewest complaints about specific cases are received."
"Why?"
"Because there is a fear of reporting such cases, because they are never communicated, because the women themselves are subjected to violence so that they do not disclose the abuses that they are suffering within the free and democratic territory of the Member States."
"Communication is therefore an absolutely central issue."
"Finally, precisely to help this integration effort, I would like to point out that in Spring 2007 I will be publishing a European manual on integration, which will be issued in all the languages spoken in the countries of the European Union, containing descriptions of cases of successful integration in the cities, provinces and regions where they have been found."
"By distributing millions of copies of this practical manual, we will publicise positive examples so that they can be imitated."
"These are examples coming from the world of local bodies."
"I can inform you that up to now the sector for which I have the least information is precisely that of the integration of immigrant women."
"I am therefore appealing to you, so that in the coming months I may receive specific examples, both positive and negative, on which I can take action."
"Otherwise, we will carry on making important statements of principle without being able to translate them into practical action, something that I, however, intend to do."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"Large number of immigrants, with special emphasis on women, face multiple discrimination and vulnerability to social exclusion."
"This is the highest challenge for us how to integrate them into the society, to help them getting access to proper education which helps them to wider employment facilities and to contribution to the development of the European Project."
"Proper legal framework is just one side of the coin."
"Implementation of legal commitments by the relevant national authorities, willingness of immigrants to respect fundamental European norms, values and to become the integral part of the society is the other."
"Huge potential lies in successful integration policies since wider employment of immigrants could help with getting forward with Lisbon employment targets."
"No actions can gain success without proper and regular dialogue with immigrant communities."
"The dialogues are perfect tools for monitoring integration processes, learning about mutual interests, intentions, request as well as obligations, determining and if necessary, altering methods and of inclusion programs."
"The forthcoming European year of equal opportunities 2007 and the year of intercultural dialogue 2008 will be a useful and potential framework opportunity to provide immigrant societies with a wide range of information on their rights, opportunities as well as informing them what Europe is expecting from them."
"Recovery of Community funds (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Paulo Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the recovery of Community funds."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to recover the amounts missing from the Community budget, what is needed is suitable determination, paperwork, transparency, stringency, proportionality and harmonisation of the rules and procedures."
"Sadly, we are a long way off achieving that."
"The European institutions must not shut themselves away in a world of rules and regulations, far removed from reality."
"For this reason, this report on the recovery of Community funds takes as its starting point a specific example: never before have we had a bigger sum to recover - it is put at almost EUR 100 million - and the circumstances surrounding the missing money are worse still."
"This concerns a crime perpetrated by a criminal organisation that has enjoyed the collusion of any number of European companies, and, following the investigation and cooperation on the part of the Italian authorities, the European bodies were notified of the details of the case."
"The Guardia de finanzia held an investigation into the illegal import of butter by firms controlled by the Naples Camorra, the adulteration of that butter with unrendered beef fat, vegetable oils and a chemical known as lipostrol, the sale of tens of thousands of tonnes of the finished product to various European companies and lastly the use of this product for the fraudulent use of export refunds and disposal subsidies for pastry goods."
"The findings of this investigation were then passed on to the relevant Community and national authorities."
"Seven years after the Italian investigation, and what has happened?"
"In one of the Member States concerned, the authorities only decided to launch an inquiry four years after the original Italian report came out, and none of the estimated missing EUR 40 million has been recovered."
"In another Member State, the inquiry has not even got off the ground, so none of the EUR 50 million-plus has been recovered."
"In a third Member State, the problem was deemed merely administrative and the original fines have been cut and the amounts involved almost nominal."
"Outside Italy, where, on the basis of a national initiative, dozens of people were arrested for murder, illegal possession of weapons and association to commit offences, and where complex legal processes are ongoing, there is no realistic expectation of securing any convictions in the countries concerned or of the Community money being recovered."
"Everything indicates that the whole process will lapse."
"Owing to legal confidentiality, most of the national authorities responsible for food safety have not, as yet, been notified of this fraud."
"While the Community and national authorities act with such a lack of determination and coordination in addressing a crime of this magnitude, countless cases have come to light, in which, under discretionary powers granted in the cause of recovering Community funds, the authorities have hounded honest farmers to return money, without any substantive justification and for procedural reasons that are not always genuine, and this has often left the farmers in a state of poverty."
"For these farmers the principles of the presumption of innocence, the right to be informed of the nature of an accusation, proportionality and the guarantee of adequate resources to mount a defence are not worth the paper they are written on."
"The crux of the matter is that Article 280 of the Treaty is being ignored."
"The notion of cooperation between the Commission and the Member States for protecting the Community's financial interests is pie in the sky."
"The effective and equivalent protection of these interests for the citizens is not being delivered."
"Against this backdrop, root and branch changes must be carried out, be it by redefining the functions of Eurojust, by establishing a European Public Prosecutor or by some other means."
"We need a European initiative that ensures that cooperation on justice, with a view to protecting the Community's financial interests, is backed up by action, and is not mere rhetoric, as has happened in this case, the biggest of its kind in the area of Community finance."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Casaca for a very good, interesting and useful report."
"It takes account of direct management, which is mainly the responsibility of the Commission, and shared management, which the Commission shares with the Member States."
"Regarding recoveries in direct management, the Commission thanks the rapporteur for his support in the current revision of financial regulation which we have already placed on the table, in particular the proposals aiming to establish a uniform time limit of five years, and of course the level of privilege for Community entitlement to fiscal claims in national law which, to our regret, the Council was reluctant to support."
"Regarding recoveries in shared management, the Commission agrees with the emphasis placed on the responsibility of the Member States, since this accounts for the biggest part of Community expenditure."
"The Commission shares the rapporteur's analysis concerning the low level of recoveries by some Member States."
"In one particular case, the sum involved is EUR 95 million."
"However, I would like to mention that this Commission has laid special emphasis on recovery."
"Between 2003 and 2006, the Commission was able to reduce recovery amounts from EUR 553 million to only EUR 160 million by September this year."
"The specific case of the 95 million is the subject of a criminal investigation in the court of one Member State and another is involved in the problem."
"So in fact less than EUR 100 million have to be recovered in the near future, and EUR 95 million after the investigation has been completed."
"We are very satisfied with the report as a whole."
"We are working with Parliament, especially the rapporteur on the Financial Regulation."
"We are cooperating closely with the Committee on Budgets on that."
"We shall give a proper response to your report and your recommendations in writing."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by extending my group's thanks to the rapporteur for a really very interesting and also important report, for there is still a lot wrong with the way in which the funds to which the Community is entitled are recovered, particularly in the way in which the Member States go about it, and it is certainly very regrettable that the Council is conspicuous by its absence today."
"We can see that more progress has been made since you, Commissioner, took the matter in hand, but I do believe that we will still have to get seriously stuck in to improvements in specific areas over the coming months, particularly in agricultural policy, which is at the heart of the whole recovery issue, and where much is still not as it should be, with 70% of old claims dating back to the period from 1971 to 2002."
"We are talking here about EUR 3.1 billion, 70% of which has still not yet been recovered."
"The present situation is pretty shameful. The total recovered amounts to less than one fifth of the EUR 6 billion outstanding in 2002."
"The President of the Court of Auditors said recently - and may I say, Mr President, that I object to the timing of this debate, since a very important report is being presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control at this very moment - that recovery was proceeding at an increasing sluggish pace and that the penalties are wholly unsuitable."
"The problem lies with the Member States; I believe that all of us here in this House are on the same side and will, come what may, raise the parity of tax demands and claims for the repayment of funds as an issue in the deliberations on the Financial Regulation, for we regard this as vitally important."
"It is also important that there should be more support for the auditors who work where these things happen, particularly those who work for national authorities, for they face the possibility of being punished for their own department's failings, and so they need our special protection."
"There is another problem within the Commission itself."
"Until recently, it was impossible to ascertain just how much was currently outstanding, and I hope that the improved accounting procedures will improve matters."
"I will close by saying that we will ensure that this issue stays on the agenda."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I believe this report is a long and drawn-out justification for the creation of a European public prosecutor."
"Indeed, judging by Mr Casaca's tone, he is positively affronted to find that the law of a Member State should ever prevail over the Commission: heaven forbid!"
"According to this document, to get round the problem we should create a law officer with authority to overrule the laws of Member States."
"This is to be done 'in the interests of a more joined-up procedure', and the other vital reason quoted is to help reduce complexity."
"As a staunch defender of the national state, I strongly oppose the creation of a European public prosecutor and anyone in this Chamber who sincerely believes in democracy rather than just paying it lip service should oppose it too."
"I particularly call upon MEPs from my country to stand with me in defence of British law."
"(DE) Mr President, it is evident that many regard the squandering of EU funds as a minor offence, for there seems to be no other explanation for the fact that, over the past thirty years or so, irregular payments were made amounting to EUR 3.1 billion, only 17% of which has been recovered."
"Inadequate monitoring procedures and non-compliance with EU rules and regulations appear to be the order of the day."
"It is bad enough that billions of euros in EU funds should disappear into fictitious accounts, but when, even in the rare cases where irregular payments are brought to light, the recovery of them is bungled or proceeded with so slowly that the culprits go to ground and the money disappears, it becomes clear that the European Union is suffering from something very like organised negligence."
"It is intolerable that there should be repeated instances of the negligent use of EU funds - and, moreover, in the same Member States - without someone having to take the consequences."
"Where Member States fail to do everything possible to recover missing funds within a maximum of two years, I believe that those Member States should themselves make good the loss."
"Mr President, EU money that is lost or unaccounted for often hits the headlines."
"It is a pity that the work done to prevent money being lost in the first place - and to recover funds that are lost - is all too often too technical, too tedious to be reported at all, let alone hit the headlines."
"However, efforts to recover funds are being made and should be supported, although, as the rapporteur clearly points out, more needs to be done."
"In particular, more needs to be done on the recovery of funds where there is shared management."
"We need to rely on the full cooperation of the national authorities to help us succeed."
"Sometimes I get the feeling that, as long as we are talking about Community funds, national authorities are not quite so keen to do their part."
"In effect they are saying: 'Our responsibility is the national budget, and that is it'."
"However, that is not it."
"When EU money is spent at national level, it is clear that national authorities are actively involved."
"National authorities also bear a strong responsibility for ensuring that Community funds are not spent erroneously, irregularly, or even fraudulently."
"If they are, then action is taken to recover them."
"The report rightly calls for Member States to stand up and be counted, to do their part, to better organise themselves and to cooperate more with the Commission so that the recovery of funds is effective and becomes a deterrent in itself."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome Mr Casaca's report, and, as a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I have to say how very embarrassing I find the dramatic increase in frauds and irregularities."
"The financial impact on structural policy measures went up from EUR 480 million in 2003 to EUR 694 million in 2004, the last reported year, in which a good 70% of the misspent funds were attributable to structural policy. To that we must also add a grey area."
"If we are less than fully able to get back the money wrongly paid out - as this own-initiative report says we are - then that shows the EU in a bad light."
"It is no small thing to have outstanding debts totalling EUR 3 billion."
"This is not, however, just about the financial loss to the EU."
"If the recovery of these funds is less than efficient, others will be encouraged to misuse money granted in aid."
"Whether money has been obtained by deliberate fraud or paid out in error, the recovery of it must run smoothly and efficiently, and even if the procedure may appear disproportionate in individual cases, the Member States must apply it, so I call on them to proceed with greater rigour and coordinate their public prosecutors' offices accordingly, while also asking them to make room for the European anti-fraud authority OLAF to become more involved in the proceedings."
"As for the Commission, I call on it to do more to make the misuse of subsidies a cause of public disgrace."
"Europe needs transparency, and so does its system of grants and subsidies."
"Where funds are used for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended, we have to put a stop to it, and for that we need more openness."
"I thank the rapporteur for helping to bring that about."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the almost forensic work he has put into this report."
"Apart from the obvious loss of money, which is very serious from an EU point of view, the public perception of fraud is quite large and to some extent it is unfair and detracts from the very good work that the European Union budget does throughout Member States."
"We should remember that by concentrating on the problem that is there."
"Unfortunately, the public blames this anonymous European Union, when the problem is much closer to home in their individual Member States."
"That message needs to go out very clearly too."
"It is unacceptable that there is so much money outstanding - some EUR 3.5 billion is owed as of June 2002."
"A great deal of money in the agriculture sector has just not been recovered because of the difficulties with Member States not cooperating."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy in 2003 should see an improvement in the position in relation to agriculture: the introduction of the single farm payment, its close links to cross-compliance measures, will ensure that money is only paid out when it should be."
"I have a niggling worry that because of past failures in agriculture, we are coming down very heavily in policing cross-compliance."
"I have farmers come to me saying that they get no notice of inspections and are faced with significant penalties for very minor mistakes."
"That is going too far, and we need to be careful not to push too far in that direction, because while it is very easy to tackle and trace EUR 5, EUR 5 billion seems to slip through the net."
"I am pleased that Commissioner Fischer Boel has said she will look at less draconian implementation, while at the same time ensuring we meet the rules."
"We do need to get the money back."
"But I would like to end by making the point that the talk, and hopefully the work towards better regulation, should improve this position."
"The past is not a pretty picture."
"Let us hope the future is a nicer one."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Written Statement (Ru1e 142)"
"(FR) It has to be said that the recovery of Community funds, following irregularities or fraud, remains insufficient."
"The financial regulation needs to be applied more rigidly, and revised."
"Thus, Parliament believes that the simplification of the recovery procedures and better coordination between the Commission services and those competent at national level constitute a crucial line of work."
"The main problem is that no national authority is totally responsible for the quality and supervision of the national controls even though 80% of the responsibility for executing the Community budget falls to the Member States, because they jointly manage it."
"The complex nature of the mechanisms thus prompts the media to hold the Commission responsible for the problems associated with illegal operations and, hence, even for the recovery of funds, even though these problems lie above all at Member State level."
"Enhanced cooperation between OLAF, Eurojust and Europol, a broader application of the recovery procedure through the use of legal channels and a request by Parliament for the Commission to lay down a regulatory framework for the financial handling of irregularities and for it to regularly present a report, via the Directorate-General, on the state of the recovery procedure, are all so many important measures that will make the procedures more transparent and effective."
"Implementing measures (level 2) of the ""Transparency"" and ""Prospectus"" directives (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the Implementing measures (level 2) for the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives."
"Mr President, allow me to address two measures proposed by the Commission on which Parliament will vote tomorrow."
"They concern the postponement of the decision on the equivalence of third country accounting standards - we aim to reach that decision by July 2008 - and the general implementation measures for the Transparency Directive."
"I would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their efficient and helpful work on these important and sensitive matters."
"Along with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, they have worked very constructively with the Commission and all parties concerned."
"The careful work of Parliament has demonstrably improved the legal texts."
"I would also like to thank the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work."
"The draft measures now represent a balanced and efficient solution."
"Firstly, on equivalence: postponing our decision on equivalence will not only ensure that EU markets remain open while work on convergence is ongoing, but will also allow us to work actively with United States and other third country authorities towards the elimination of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad."
"This is and will remain our number one objective."
"The additional two years will enable us to align the equivalence decision with the Securities and Exchange Commission's timeline in its roadmap towards eliminating the need for reconciliation between IFRS and US GAAP."
"The United States authorities are committed to working towards the recognition of equivalence of IFRS and US GAAP."
"With the new timing of the equivalence decisions, we will be able to work in parallel towards common agreed objectives."
"In this context, it is important to emphasise that nothing is predetermined."
"We will decide on equivalence by mid-2008, in the light of progress in convergence, and it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that any specific GAAP will 'pass the test'."
"It has always been our priority to keep our options open."
"I know that Parliament shares that objective."
"Before 1 January 2008, we will have decided on both a definition of equivalence and the equivalence mechanism."
"This will be done by way of comitology, with the full involvement of Parliament."
"Exemption for issuers of professional securities from the need to provide narrative description of differences between third country GAAPs and IFRS remains an issue of concern."
"We know that Parliament has doubts about this amendment."
"Its aim is strictly to remove the ambiguity in the existing Prospectus Regulation."
"We regret that we were alerted about this ambiguity only a few weeks ago, but we are convinced that this amendment is necessary to ensure legal certainty."
"Secondly, on the transparency measures: the Transparency Directive is a major step towards integrated European financial markets that investors and the public can trust."
"To achieve this, it is important to complete the transparency obligations by adopting the Commission implementing measures today under your consideration."
"Parliament has made several proposals to the Commission for improving this text, which I appreciate."
"The Commission is ready to accept the substance of most of them, unless this is not possible for technical reasons."
"In particular, Parliament raised questions on the notification to be made by market makers indicating their intention to make use of one of the exceptions to the Directive."
"The Commission prefers a solution that limits the administrative burden, and therefore the cost, for market makers."
"This is why the Commission is in favour of market makers filing this notification with their own competent authority only, instead of with potentially 25 authorities."
"I believe this solution fits perfectly with the simplification agenda that the Commission supports."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, in this era of globalisation we often bemoan Europe's laggardness in setting global standards."
"However, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are essentially a European project incorporating a principles-based system of accounting."
"Much of the world will adopt that European accountancy standard."
"It is appropriate that we allow third countries the time to adapt, but 1 January 2009 is surely long enough a delay for that purpose."
"Until now our European companies have had to adapt to US general accounting principles while we accepted US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Europe."
"With IFRS there is no reason for that discrimination to continue."
"I am glad that the American authorities are intent on meeting the deadline for agreeing equivalence."
"They even seem increasingly persuaded of the advantages of principles-based accounting."
"Nevertheless, finding commonality between a strict rules-based system and a more flexible principles-based system is not simple."
"Both sides of the Atlantic agree that equivalence, rather than strict convergence, will be a suitable outcome."
"That is why we call upon the Commission to stick to the January 2008 deadline to define what equivalence will be, so as to make the ultimate time limit of 1 January 2009 a strict time limit."
"Any third-country companies reporting in the European Union from that date on will have to report either in IFRS or an accounting system that is agreed to be equivalent, and that agreement will be reciprocal."
"European accounts, in accordance with IFRS, will be accepted without adjustment in the US and other consenting third countries."
"That will help European companies to cut costs and compete for capital in a globalised marketplace."
"My group looks to the Commission to pay due attention to the proposals in our joint resolution and to achieve a successful outcome of these important negotiations before 2009."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his words about the report."
"I believe it is the close working relationship that has developed between Parliament, its various groups and the Commission that has helped to steady the rudder on this one."
"Quite clearly we are entering a very dangerous time: we have two years in which to get this right, to measure the value of equivalence and reach convergence with countries around the world."
"So the Commissioner is absolutely right to point this out not only to the USA but also to other third countries."
"However, the USA is certainly the big project that we all know about."
"That is going to be the tough one, and we are quite clearly afraid that the billions of dollars and euros between our two capital markets at the transatlantic level will be put in jeopardy if we do not get this right."
"I am very positive that we are on the right route and I believe that what Parliament has put forward has helped to strengthen the methodology, also scrutinising the approach which will be involved in this particular battle."
"Looking at the bulk of this directive and the amendments from the supervisors and others in this House - and I am very grateful to colleagues who have assisted on this issue - I believe that we have not overburdened the business community."
"That is and has always been vital."
"You cannot use the term 'light touch' all the time and then overburden business."
"This is an important cross-border capital market issue and we need greater coherence and communication between the various operators within that market."
"We also need to ensure that investors are protected and that the right information is communicated to them in a relevant and timely manner."
"These are issues which, of course, are now left to the Member State."
"I think the Commissioner might agree with me that we should be using the most modern methods to communicate to investors."
"I do not have much time, so I shall not pursue all the issues of this particular directive."
"However, I should like to turn to one recital in the original directive and bend the Commissioner's ear."
"That recital concerns the voluntary initiatives to help companies report what they pay governments around the world in the extractive industries."
"As the Commissioner might remember - and I am sure his departments will - this was an initiative which was to help end corrupt practices."
"It was aimed not only at places as far-flung as Africa, but also within our own borders."
"Companies were meant to volunteer information about what they pay governments so that we in turn would know, and investors would know, just what money changed hands between governments and companies."
"It was aimed at the extractive industries because it was clear that this was an area in which an awful lot of money was going abroad, away from the countries where it should have been used."
"My final question to the Commissioner is to ask what he and his services might do to support that initiative."
"I think this House would enjoy hearing again what your predecessor gave as a promise some years ago."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something about the implementing provisions of the transparency directive, which Parliament, since they are what are termed Level 2 measures, is capable of influencing only to a limited extent."
"That makes it all the more important that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted, unanimously, a draft report on the basis of which the plenary will now adopt a resolution of its own."
"By presenting a united front, the committee has succeeded, even before tomorrow's vote, in getting the Commission to accept some of its core demands."
"The first is that market makers cannot be compelled to invest the financial instruments that they keep for market-making activities in a separate account, although the supervisory authority can require a separate account if the market maker is unable to identify, at any given time, the relevant financial instruments when asked to do so."
"Secondly, fair competition requires that the same conditions should apply to parent companies of management companies and investment firms from third countries as do to those from the European Union."
"Finally, a distinction is to be drawn between transactions on stock exchanges and outside them, for, while, in the former, ownership is transferred when the contract is concluded and immediate notification is thus made not only possible but also necessary, the conclusion of the contract and the transfer of ownership may be separate when transactions are concluded off-market, and it would be wrong to require notification as soon as a contract was concluded, since a report at this juncture could, unlike in the former instance, have the effect of distorting the market."
"Despite Parliament's success on this negotiating front, there are still areas - and Commissioner McCreevy has indeed referred to them - where the Commission has not yet done as Parliament would wish, including, for example, such questions as, firstly, to which authority a market maker must apply for an exemption from the notification requirement when he reaches a specific threshold value; secondly, what is the minimum content required of non-consolidated half-year accounts not drawn up in accordance with international financial reporting standards, and, thirdly, how it can be guaranteed that accountants will proceed in the same way when auditing half-yearly reports."
"I appeal to the Members of this House to vote 'yes' tomorrow, in order that we may seize our opportunity to get the Commission and the Member States to carefully examine Parliament's demands on these outstanding items and, in due course, accede to them."
"Mr President, as I did in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am today standing in for my colleague Professor Lauk, the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to whom we all wish a good recovery following the operation on his shoulder."
"It is on his behalf that I would like to thank not only the rapporteur, Mr Skinner of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but also the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Klinz - who, like me, hails from Hessen - for their constructive cooperation."
"It was the compromise reached by these three that made it possible for us, in the committee, to adopt the draft resolution unanimously."
"Even the Commission has been efficient."
"Commissioner McCreevy has incorporated the essential points in his draft of the implementing Directive and, following consultations, made further modifications."
"This solution makes for more transparent information on securities authorised on the regulated market."
"There are three points that the PPE-DE Group saw as particularly important."
"The first had to do with the need for the requirements applicable to half-yearly audits not to be excessively bureaucratic, the consequence of which was that the figures for comparison purposes do not need to be submitted immediately upon the entry into force of the directive; a more reasonable transitional period was decided upon."
"Secondly, where voting rights were concerned, our intention was that subsidiaries would be listed both as part of their parent companies and as independent entities, and we managed that too."
"Thirdly, where publication, of necessity, has to be accomplished rapidly, it should be laid down in detail which media are to be used."
"That was agreed to as well."
"These productive changes have prompted my group to endorse Mr Skinner's report."
"Both Mr Lauk and I look forward to it receiving broad support in this House tomorrow."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the number of globally-active enterprises is on the increase; their need for comparable and globally recognised group accounts in order to gain access to international capital markets has been an agent of change in accountancy at the international level, and the headlong progress of globalisation is making the harmonisation of accounting procedures across borders a matter of positive necessity."
"The adoption of the International Accounting Standards Regulation was an important milestone in the creation of an integrated single financial market and in the harmonisation of accountancy in Europe."
"A developed capital market puts national economies in a better competitive position, and studies have demonstrated that Member States with a high degree of share capitalisation and high stock exchange turnovers relative to their gross domestic product also achieve more growth and create more jobs."
"That being so, it is certainly desirable that the IFRS and American GAAP accounting regulations, together with the accounting principles generally accepted in third countries, should be made more closely approximate as an essential contribution to the development of standardised and internationally recognised accounting standards and hence to the integration of capital markets."
"Rather than aiming simply to do away with the existing difference in the accounting systems of the United States, Canada or Japan, the primary object of convergence must be the creation of high-quality accounting standards, which alone will be of lasting value and meet with unconditional acceptance."
"It is of vital importance to European businesses that the SEC, the USA's stock exchange supervisory body, should recognise year-end accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS."
"The one-sidedness in the recognition of accounting standards should become a thing of the past by January 2009 at the latest; that is the only way in which European businesses will become more competitive."
"- (LT) The document being discussed is technically concise and clear - we are speaking here about accounting standards."
"Yet, as we emphasised in our draft resolution, in economic and political terms this issue is very significant and complex, since in essence it concerns the role of the European Union in the global financial market."
"International financial accounting standards based on principles form a constituent part of our European financial model, which will be adopted by developing countries as well."
"Therefore, the European Commission must take action in support of the application of such standards in developing countries, promote their quality and European nature and in this way develop an image of the European financial market and offer various solutions (not only in a technical sense)."
"We should not forget that the United States also has a perfectly functional system of accounting standards."
"Therefore, whether we like it or not, international and American accounting standards are presently competing in the market of the European Union; that is, we, the legislators, are competing."
"I believe that the European Parliament is ready for this competition, but for businesses it is too costly to adhere to more than one standard, and the developing markets feel confused."
"They do not know which standards are to be implemented."
"Consequently, the European Commission should look for ways to harmonise the standards or encourage harmonisation of the standards at the level of appropriate bodies."
"We should not forget that it is not only a technical issue that we are discussing, but rather the development of the global financial market, and for harmonisation of the standards we need two things: clear guidelines for implementation of harmonisation and a clear definition of what harmonisation really means."
"Some of us think that informal negotiations are more effective, since no one needs to voice their positions in advance."
"Different methods and tactics in negotiations are possible, but I do not think the European Parliament would agree that decisions to be made in harmonising accounting standards should infringe on key IFRS principles, their high quality and reputation."
"It is out of the question for the European Parliament to make decisions without consulting Parliament and the players in financial markets."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to use this opportunity to highlight two crucial points in both these reports."
"The first is that, formally speaking, and as far as I am aware, the new comitology procedure is not yet applicable in this area, but I take it as read that the Commission will take due account of how this House votes, since it will be applicable to new amendments in the future."
"The second has to do with the question as to how we should apply the IFRS standards in future, an aspect that will become more and more important."
"What I can say on behalf of our own group is that we, in principle, welcome IFRS standards as an international rule for European businesses, but it has to be said that there are conditions attached to that."
"Convergence must be achieved, but that must also involve the European outlook and European priorities prevailing in future discussions on this subject."
"It is for that reason that I am annoyed when I hear, emanating from the Board of Trustees, signals to the effect that a thoroughly critical view is being taken of the discussion as to whether, and if so when, convergence is achievable."
"The main question, though, has to do with how, in future, we are to devise further standards."
"It is no secret that we have now had a debate on what are termed 'IFRS for SMEs'."
"The wheels are very definitely turning, and discussions are in progress in the relevant bodies; all of this has become quite separate from any political process, and so I would like not only to encourage the Commission but also to urge them to monitor this process very rigorously in the interests of its being subject to political and democratic constraints, and ensure that this House is involved."
"I am this House's rapporteur on this subject area, and I also have experience of Basel."
"You can take it as read that this process will not work on the basis of an agreement being reached at international level and Parliament being left with no option but to adopt it; that is why there needs to be close dialogue between Commission and Parliament."
"The Commission is not merely encouraged, but also urged, to take active account of European interests and not to allow the Board to present it with faits accomplis in the way it has done before on other issues."
"(FR) Mr President, on the occasion of this debate on the adaptation of the Prospectus and Transparency directives regarding the road map negotiated by Mr McCreevy with the US authorities, we are in a position to review the way in which the IFRS have been implemented."
"The greatest caution must be exercised in relation to this matter."
"One of the great contributions, I believe, of this Parliament is the way in which it ensured, during the equivalence negotiations, that there was genuine equivalence and not just a deadline that would elapse before it was finally pointed out that, where there were once differences, there would now be equivalence."
"As you know only too well, Commissioner, this issue is all about negotiation."
"You have succeeded in getting the Americans to commit themselves to reconciliation at the end of the time period and, when that time period expires, you will remain empty-handed if, in the meantime, this Parliament has not helped to consolidate the matter so that, in the end, we secure an acceptable recognition of equivalence."
"I very much regret the fact that we were unable, before this plenary session, to organise with our colleagues from the US Congress the videoconference that I proposed, that my fellow coordinators accepted and that would have enabled us, together with the US political authorities, to hold the necessary debate on the latter's ability to comply with this road map that you have made your own, Commissioner."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues who have worked on these very difficult dossiers."
"I welcome the spirit in which the implementing measures for the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives were formulated, after the very tough MiFID procedure for which I was the rapporteur before the spring break."
"It is extremely important for the European Parliament to be able to have confidence in comitology, especially now, after the July decision."
"We are delegating a large part of our decision-making powers to the Commission and we want to ensure that the legislation enacted in the Lamfalussy process gives the best possible technical quality, as well as democratic legitimacy."
"However, for Parliament to get rid of, for example, the sunset clauses - which is the wish of the Commission -we still need more guarantees on the improved procedure of the comitology decision and on Parliament having full influence on the second-level measures."
"For the record, MiFID is a very important process and will certainly do far more than many people think for the financial services sector."
"It is also a good example of the influence Parliament can have."
"Industry and the market participants want us to use our powers more and people really respected the changes Parliament was making with that report."
"I think the same thing will happen with the 'Transparency' and 'Prospectus' directives."
"It is very important that the European Parliament strengthens its powers in those areas."
"Through this we will be able to give more support to the Community."
"Sometimes there is unnecessary gold-plating by the Council."
"It has put forward proposals which are placing the single market at risk and I think that the Community's soldiers - the Commission and the European Parliament - should march together on these issues, as it would benefit the single market."
"Mr President, I shall briefly touch on the two topics."
"As regards the equivalence decision, it is right to postpone it."
"It is the most efficient way to promote the use of IFRS."
"It gives us leverage in our efforts to obtain the removal of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad, as it ensures that EU markets remain attractive to foreign issuers."
"It will benefit EU investors and issuers alike."
"I am aware of the concerns of Members of the European Parliament and others regarding many of these issues, but a clear roadmap has been set out."
"If there is goodwill on all sides we will reach a satisfactory end, but in any event if we do not reach a satisfactory outcome then, as we say in my country, nothing is lost."
"So I think that the prolongation of the time period is the correct decision for many reasons."
"First, so that we give ourselves here in Europe an opportunity to see how IFRS has been implemented in the various Member States - and we will be learning in that process as well."
"We have a clear commitment from our colleagues in the United States as to the roadmap and the time lines there and, all things being equal, we should reach a satisfactory conclusion."
"But if we do not and if we are not satisfied, then, as I say, nothing is lost."
"Worldwide more people are moving to the IFRS accounting standards which Europe adopted as from last year, so therefore it will be to our benefit."
"Concerning the great question posed by Mr Radwan and others about this question of convergence and equivalence, let us see where we are in the few short years hence."
"On the transparency directive, I shall deal with the point raised by Mr Skinner."
"His point relates to a provision in the recital of the level 1 directive, and this recital stipulates that payments by the extractive industries should be reported."
"This as such is not the subject of today's debate, but I can confirm that the Commission will monitor this issue."
"Concerning the implementing measures to the transparency directive, I should also add that I understand some of the concerns expressed in relation to future developments."
"In this regard, the Commission commits itself to making a declaration that will be added to the minutes of the European Securities Committee on the date of the vote on the draft implementing measures."
"It should state that the Commission undertakes to re-examine the issue of the auditors' review of half-yearly financial statements once the work in relation to the international standards on auditing, currently under development, is sufficiently advanced."
"The Commission will also re-examine, within two years of the final deadline for transposition, the question of the minimum content of the condensed set of half-yearly financial statements that are not prepared in accordance with international accounting standards."
"The Commission also undertakes to conduct a review of how the regulated information is disseminated in practice pursuant to the obligations of the transparency directive and the future implementing directive."
"This could be undertaken two years after the end of the transposition period for the implementing directive."
"In this way we will ensure that the transparency directive tools are adapted to improvements in the market."
"Pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received two motions for resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"LIFE+ - Financing of the Natura 2000 network"
"The next item is"
"the recommendation for second reading (06284/1/2006 C6-0226/2006 on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Isler Béguin)"
"the debate on the oral question to the Commission on financing of the NATURA 2000 framework by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety B6-0441/2006)."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by thanking the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, in particular, my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the work that we have done together, because I believe that it can be said - even though, as is customary at this hour, the Chamber is not very full - that we have genuinely carried out a joint piece of work and that this report, which bears my name, could just as well bear the name of my fellow Members, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, Mrs Ries or even Mrs Lienemann, who apologises for not being able to take part in this evening's debate."
"We have also produced a joint piece of work with the Commission."
"Unfortunately, it is regrettable that the Council is not present, because, ultimately, our results will depend greatly on it."
"I am entirely convinced that the cooperation that we have been able to put in place during this first reading and that follows on from the common position will enable us to reach a consensus with the Council and with yourself, and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to pass the results of this debate on to the Council."
"Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE+ is no longer the programme that we once knew, but will indeed constitute the Union's 'environment' budget heading."
"Thus, it is LIFE+ that will govern Europe's innovative policies, that will rise to the challenges, such as the fight against climate change and the efforts to rid the air and soil of pollution, that will prevent biodiversity damage and that will provide the Environment DG and the NGOs, our bio-indicators par excellence, with the means to endow the Member States' environmental policies with European added value."
"In fact, as you will know, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking here about an 'impossible budget heading', given the derisory sum that the Council and the Commission have granted it."
"We made an attempt, at first reading, to increase this LIFE heading, which, I must point out, does not even represent 1% of the overall budget, with the aim of bringing it into line with the policies much-publicised by the Union itself."
"The debate focused back then on support for the Natura 2000 network, our flagship environmental policy."
"By adding EUR 21 billion, which even the Commission felt was necessary if Natura 2000 was to be managed properly, the European Parliament sent out a strong signal to the Commission and to the Council."
"We were right to do so."
"Today, with the reduction in the Structural Funds budgets, a form of unbridled competition has begun in the regions, and all of our colleagues are having a change of heart."
"As Natura 2000 does not specifically feature in the financial regulations, well, it will undoubtedly be environmental volunteers who produce the results."
"We should not get our hopes up too much, however, regarding the share that will be reserved for the protection of nature and biodiversity, despite the fact that, at the European Parliament's first reading, we were virtually unanimous in our support of an ambitious European policy."
"The common position proposed to us has spectacularly ignored our warning."
"Worse still, it is deviating from it in an alarming way, going so far as to grant 80% of the delegated management responsibility to the Member States, even though you did not mention this percentage in your initial proposal."
"What minister would refuse such a gift?"
"Admittedly, we also realise that, with too few staff members, the Commission is afraid of managing multiple projects."
"This is made all the more difficult by the fact that, with a reduction in the number of European officials having been announced, there remains little hope of the Environment DG strengthening its staff."
"Let us make it very clear to you: this approach is not the right one because the European level remains the most relevant and most secure one for dealing with environmental issues."
"We even feel that this handover of power from the Commission to the Member States is dangerous."
"In our view, this initial strategy to renationalise the environmental policies is the sign of a slow disintegration of the European idea."
"Each Member State demanding its initial bet would thus be free to dip into the Lisbon Strategy, and thus to become an unrivalled competitor - and we know full well that competition generally goes hand in hand with environmental damage - or to claim that sustainable development, which requires a global approach, is the opposite of such competition."
"We also know the extent to which the label 'environment' serves to justify problems that destroy the environment."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the trap that we refuse to fall into because to do so would be to negate all of the successes that Europe has had in relation to the environment."
"If there is one policy that can be seen, identified, recognised and appreciated by Europeans, it is indeed the one that we have succeeded in implementing on environmental protection."
"We all know that LIFE must enable us to deal with emergencies and to implement policies aimed at restoring our environment."
"The EUR 100 million that were extracted at the time of the financial perspective and that we are demanding, Commissioner, be allocated entirely to the environment will not be enough to achieve these aims."
"Commissioner, unless you are a magician, it will be impossible for you to keep your promises with such derisory sums."
"Entrusting them to the Member States therefore means running the risk of failure."
"Our ambition is for the Union to remain the flagship, the global leader that takes the initiative for establishing laws to protect the planet."
"That requires the Commission to be able to produce ambitious policies, to assume responsibility and control of the quality of the projects launched at Member State level and to reject any that are unsuitable."
"European policy must under no circumstances compensate for the Member States' failings in relation to the environment, and, as you will understand, we are refusing to give them a blank cheque."
"On the other hand, we are perfectly aware that the delay that this procedure could cause is also liable to cause delays in terms of funding."
"That is why, together, we have tabled the same amendment, so as to ensure that the work done by your Environment DG continues to be funded, pending an agreement, of course."
"Above all, we also want it to be possible for this work to continue and even for you to launch new projects and oversee the funding of the work done by NGOs."
"We should like to make it clear in this House that, legally and financially, that is possible."
"To conclude, Mr President, I would say that the ball is now in the court of the Council and of the Commission and that we are convinced that we are going to reach an agreement amongst ourselves precisely so as to ensure that this ambitious environmental policy is taken forward."
"That is what our fellow citizens expect, and they encourage you in that regard."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, there are two parts to my speech."
"In the first part, I shall put the oral question on Natura 2000 by Mr Florenz, who is not present and who has asked me to speak on his behalf."
"The question is as follows: since the Commission estimates that EUR 6.1 billion per year is needed to maintain and conserve the Natura 2000 protected areas, and since the funding is expected to come from the rural development funds, the Structural Funds, LIFE+ and the fisheries funds, how does the Commission intend to coordinate this policy?"
"How does the Commission intend to send clear messages about its coordinated policy to users, to proprietors and to those who are in charge of Natura 2000 land."
"Where are the funds?"
"What actions must be taken?"
"How accessible is European Union protection and aid?"
"This is something that is still not clear."
"Matters need to be drawn up in a very clear way so that there can be full genuine communication between the proprietors and the Commission."
"With regard to LIFE+, I agree with everything Mrs Isler Béguin has said."
"The results of the vote reflect a genuine agreement within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, though there may be discrepancies and differing positions due to the diverging views of the different States."
"Why?"
"Because the new LIFE+ now being presented represents a decentralised policy and is very different to the policy in place until now."
"We believe that LIFE has traditionally been a leader programme for funding innovation projects and innovative management models, particularly in the field of the environment."
"It is a prestige programme, which NGOs have looked upon as a guide and a model."
"For local and regional authorities, it has become a path that must be followed, a permanent reference."
"We want that reference to remain."
"This has, however, been the case because emphasis has been placed on the universal nature of environmental policy, a factor that has been one of the reasons for the success of European policy in this field."
"Europe knows that environmental policy cannot just be applied to a single region."
"It requires a global approach."
"The European Union has always made this clear, and the 6th Environmental Action Programme has taken that into account at all times."
"Policy in the fields of climate change, desertification, water, waste, safeguarding quality of life, well-being and pollution are all of a universal nature, and that is why we want it to be applied beyond Europe and for Europe to become a model for the whole world."
"We should remember, however, that LIFE was created in order to bring this about, and that is stated in the text of the financial statement, which I am going to read and which states that LIFE+ credit 'is intended to fund economic contributions for actions intended to apply, update and implement Community legislation and policy in the field of the environment, including the integration of the environment into other policies'."
"How can we do this if the policy is only national?"
"How can we do this if Europe loses its leadership, if it leaves these actions in the hands of the Member States?"
"We therefore advocate in the clearest and strongest terms a more centralised model in which Europe once again provides guidance and initiative."
"We understand that the Commission has a lack of resources."
"We are going to support it in the future, where possible, because this policy of reducing the number of officials cannot carry on."
"Unless Europe has a management structure and management capacities, as well as qualified personnel, it will not be able to carry out this task."
"With a view to its being able to do so, we undoubtedly believe that part of the management should be returned to the European Commission and that international European projects should be created, so that Europe can improve its capacities in the future, by means of 'capacity building', in order to ensure that projects are better monitored, to find ways to coordinate policies and to continue taking action that cuts across policy areas."
"That is our proposal, and we shall cooperate fully in the conciliation process so that we can reach a quick agreement, so that funding can be guaranteed and, of course, so that the Commission can do its job."
"That is precisely why we are here: in order to cooperate with the Commission and tell the Member States that the policy of sustainability is a process and that Europe is more than just a market."
"Μember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, for her exceptional work and for her report on this proposal."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Gutiérrez for her very positive approach and to assure both ladies and all the Members of Parliament that the Commission will work to facilitate this approach and to achieve fast agreement with the Council."
"I must stress that, since September 2004 - when the College of Commissioners adopted the Commission proposal - about one year after first reading, we have made a great deal of progress with LIFE+ and the position of the European Commission has changed significantly on several counts in comparison with its initial proposal."
"I believe that the Council's common position, with which the Commission agrees to a large extent, satisfies many of Parliament's basic demands."
"The draft regulation now includes a section relating to nature and biodiversity."
"LIFE+ will be able to fund measures and activities for exchanges of opinions and best practices or demonstration projects, including those relating to the management and designation of Natura 2000 sites and guidelines for habitats and birds."
"The percentage of LIFE+ relating to the management of nature is large."
"At least 40% of the resources will be made available for expenditure in this sector."
"I should like to stress that this percentage is a minimum limit and that the Member States may spend a greater percentage if they so wish."
"As far as the question of funding for Natura 2000 is concerned, the Commission has secured funding opportunities through the Structural Funds, the Fisheries Fund and the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development."
"The Commission may, of course, encourage spending on Natura 2000; however, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States have the jurisdiction and discretion to decide on the extent to which they wish to make use of these funding opportunities."
"The Commission, for its part, will do what it can to ensure the Member States make use of the funding opportunities whenever possible."
"The opinion of the Directorate General of the Environment is always sought before strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes for the Structural Funds and rural development programmes submitted by the Member States are approved."
"I repeat that one of our top priorities is to safeguard suitable funding for Natura 2000 and that is why I particularly value Parliament's support on this issue."
"However, the most important subject of debate this evening is the method of implementation of the programme."
"According to the common position, 80% of funding for LIFE+ is to be made available to the Member States."
"I consider that Parliament's preference for maintaining central management of the programme to be an indication of its confidence in the Commission."
"However, this choice, as I emphasised earlier, requires more human resources."
"That is why the method proposed in the common position is preferable."
"First, it is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, granting the greatest possible flexibility in order to cover the various requirements of the Member States."
"Secondly, it ensures that all the countries receive a minimum percentage of the funding."
"Within the framework of the current LIFE III system, they often do not receive any money."
"Thirdly, it is transparent and controlled and safeguards the maintenance of added value for the European Union."
"As you know, delegated management is at the epicentre of the Commission proposal."
"The Member States are relying on it and are already preparing their draft programmes."
"That is why the Commission cannot accept the various amendments deleting all references to delegated management."
"Unfortunately, the outcome of the informal meetings between Parliament, the Council and the Commission following the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 14 September did not enable us to make significant steps towards achieving agreement as regards delegated management."
"Nonetheless, despite the differences, we are all in favour of the LIFE+ programme and of its being applied as soon as possible, so that funds can be disbursed and there is no delay in the execution of the programmes."
"The Member States have over two billion euros for the LIFE+ programme."
"A way needs to be found so that this money is disbursed as quickly as possible, even if this means compromise on all sides."
"We must therefore continue to work together to find practical solutions, especially as regards the method of implementing LIFE+."
"Within this framework, we shall make every possible effort to bring about a compromise between the Council and Parliament and we shall intermediate in order to facilitate an agreement."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Within the framework of the LIFE III programme, running since 2000, we have spent more than EUR 950 million on various environmental protection programmes for the successful completion of countless local, regional and cross-border projects."
"Even more importantly, it is precisely these projects which have brought the Union into close proximity to ordinary people, and which contribute most directly to improving the living conditions of EU citizens."
"These are important considerations at a time when the popularity of the European Union is at an all-time low."
"The status of LIFE+, and within it of the Natura 2000 programme, gives cause for concern and raises at least two significant questions."
"The first is the fact that it is already clear that no timely decision will be taken regarding the new programme, and, as a result, we will not be able to launch the environmental protection programmes next January, as planned."
"In my view, this is a serious problem."
"Therefore, I propose that we follow the solution adopted in 2004, when a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council extended the LIFE III programme, which was then expiring, for two more years with an additional budget of EUR 317 million."
"I propose that we now take a decision that will keep the LIFE programme, which is due to expire in 2006, in force until the new regulation has been accepted."
"The second problematic area is the Council's proposal to delegate 80% of the funds to be managed by the Member States."
"In my view, this is contrary to the logic and the practice followed hitherto, according to which environmental protection, by virtue of its cross-border nature, calls for a supranational approach."
"For this reason, I personally can only support proposals that leave a greater proportion of the power to decide on the funds available within the competence of the Commission and of Parliament than does the present proposal."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, please accept Mrs Lienemann's sincere apologies for being unable to attend this evening, as you are all aware of her commitment to this matter."
"It is, however, with the same pleasure and the same convictions that I take her place."
"I would like to remind you of all the support that our group offers to Mrs Isler Béguin's report and to pay tribute to the agreement reached by our political groups on an ambitious strategy to consolidate the only direct financial instrument intended for European environment policies."
"It should also be emphasised that it is our Parliament that obtained additional budgetary credits for LIFE, although well below our initial aims."
"Today, it is once again MEPs who are calling for strengthened resources to support the implementation of the Natura Directive."
"An effort has been made, undoubtedly insufficient, but obtained in a tight budgetary situation within which we must work."
"Our disagreements, as matters stand with this issue, concern the method chosen for financing activities."
"LIFE is an exemplary European instrument."
"It has proved itself, and we cannot accept that this policy should be renationalised, as planned, with the management of 80% of its budget delegated to the Member States."
"The European Union must not content itself with handing out money, it must hold the reins of this environmental policy."
"At a time when the European idea needs to be safeguarded, and given that this is a policy largely supported by EU citizens, it is unacceptable to undermine the European dynamic in this way."
"Our credibility in the eyes of Europeans is at stake following the statements in the future sustainable development strategy."
"Moreover, LIFE must retain its exemplary status, which is founded on the choice of innovative and reproducible projects."
"It is clear that we must guarantee Member States the level of funding that they expect, while requiring that the selection of projects is informed by a double rationale: one involving the European dimension and meaningful environmental practice."
"Our group supports Mrs Haug's amendment calling on the Commission to guarantee continued funding for programmes now under way."
"Indeed, we cannot accept that NGOs and other parties involved in LIFE should be penalised."
"Mr President, twelve months ago, together with our rapporteur Mrs Isler Béguin, we deplored this veritable gift made by the Commission."
"I am referring to a subject on which a great deal has been said already: the delegation of environmental policies to the Member States, which are to manage up to 80% of the LIFE+ budget."
"In this regard, I share our rapporteur's regret that, during our informal discussions with the Finnish Presidency, the latter did not take a firm step in the direction of meeting public concern for a better environment and quality of life."
"It is clear that a solution must be found to this institutional disagreement and, in the meantime, the principle of providing continued funding for Community environment policy must, of course, stand."
"This is the aim of our Amendment 32."
"Like my fellow Members, I therefore question this 'blank cheque' offered to the Member States on a plate."
"Why renationalise what Europe as such does so well, even with so very few resources, as has already been said: namely, protecting biodiversity and rare species?"
"I would point out some of the successes achieved in the areas of nature, the environment and third countries since LIFE was first set up, in 1992."
"In my own country, Belgium, no fewer than 120 biodiversity protection projects have been cofinanced by the European Union."
"It is thanks to LIFE and the proper overall functioning of Natura 2000 that 20% of Belgium territory is now classified as a special nature protection area."
"Furthermore, last Thursday, the Commission unveiled 75 environmental projects that will benefit from the Union's support - support totalling EUR 136 million thanks to the LIFE programme."
"To return to Belgium, I am delighted that the restoration of the Hautes Fagnes plateau covering more than 4 500 hectares in the beautiful Ardennes region is one of the projects accepted."
"Should we see this as a good omen?"
"I hope so because, in championing Europe in terms of its environment, we are also providing for the health and well-being of future generations."
"I am sure, moreover, that, as I have emphasised, Europe has everything to gain by committing itself wholeheartedly, as Europe, to this fight to preserve the natural world and biodiversity."
"To conclude, Mr President, this is a fight that, as has been said and as it is important to emphasise, has transcended political divides throughout the debate."
"The fact that we have all rallied strongly around our rapporteur - whom I would like to thank and congratulate once again - is the best proof of this today."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Florenz for his question."
"Last year, I was the rapporteur for Parliament's report on the financing of Natura 2000."
"In that report, we expressed concern about the willingness of the Member States and of the Commission to take this issue seriously."
"There will be plenty of voices speaking out for the natural world when it is time for headline speeches."
"Just think how solemn the Heads of State or Government were in Gothenburg in 2001 in their assurances that Natura 2000 would be implemented."
"Yet, for all that, everything was forgotten when it came to the budget being adopted, when the separate budget heading for Natura 2000 was rejected point blank."
"Now it will be interesting to see whether those promises are recalled when the agricultural lobbyists again try to ensure that all the subsidies, including the rural development funds, go to large-scale agriculture and to industry."
"The Commission will have to be stricter in this area."
"The slackness and lack of supervision that have been the case up to now are on the point of having disastrous consequences, first and foremost for the natural world, but also for the reputation of the EU, as many of my fellow MEPs have mentioned today."
"For many people, the protection of nature and the environment is one of the pivotal benefits of the EU."
"We politicians, when we have had to defend and expound upon the necessity of European cooperation, have continually made reference to what the EU can do in this area."
"At present, however, many experience an indifference on the part of the EU in respect of those values that cannot quickly be converted into money."
"Rapid action needs to be taken if our good name is to be rescued."
"The Commission should make it a condition for the payment of, in particular, rural development funds that the Member States put forward plans and also appropriate sufficient resources to Natura 2000."
"It should remember also to remind agriculturalists that the rural development funds do not constitute agriculturalists' own private money."
"Natura 2000 must receive its share, and without agriculture receiving compensation for this."
"Agriculture should bear its share of responsibility for the health and diversity of nature."
"This would be good news for everyone in rural areas."
"There are splendid opportunities for money-making in the development of Natura 2000."
"We know, for example, that approximately a quarter of a million people are engaged in the protection of nature, while the potential in the tourism sector is greater still."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her exceptional report and her strong position as regards the demands of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in connection with LIFE+."
"A key point is to secure adequate resources for the Natura 2000 programme."
"That is why I heartily support the call for another EUR 50 billion to be added to the LIFE+ budget."
"If we leave the 50 million in the margin, with just one political commitment, as called for by the Council, we shall have no clear guarantee."
"I also support the call by the Committee on the Environment for 55% of LIFE+ to be allocated to nature and biodiversity, which are issues of critical importance in the effort to achieve the corresponding objective of the European Union."
"In all events, the additional EUR 100 million agreed within the framework of the financial perspective should be committed to above the 40% proposed by the Council."
"If the percentage remains 40%, this essentially will mean a proportional reduction in the corresponding funding for biodiversity in comparison with the previous financial perspective and that is unacceptable."
"Finally, I agree with the rapporteur, who has reacted to the Commission's proposal to grant 80% of resources to the Member States, thereby giving them a blank cheque."
"The resources for LIFE+ are not there for the Member States to plug financial gaps, but to promote joint European programmes."
"Commissioner, you know full well that, in the country we both come from, money often goes to cover wages rather than to protect the Natura 2000 network."
"We want a strong European policy; all of us in the European Parliament want more Europe for environmental protection."
"If the Commission wants the same, then why does it not stand up for it against the Council?"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I would tend to support the 80% management of LIFE by Member States."
"This would ensure a much better and fairer spread of funds across the EU and across the many different types of environment within the EU."
"It would bring more local knowledge to the project selection process and make public awareness easier to achieve."
"I have only one hesitation as an Irish MEP: I believe that the second half of the second pillar of LIFE - implementation of existing environmental policy - is critical."
"This is a priority, because there is no point in funding new policies and projects when we have not learned to implement the standards we have already imposed on ourselves."
"Frankly, this is a problem in my home country, when it comes to industry."
"My Member State's Environmental Protection Agency seems to be very reluctant to force the same compliance on industry as it does on the public."
"In my willingness to support management of LIFE+ at Member-State level, I would still like to see a reasonable level of scrutiny to ensure that the projects selected prioritise efforts to improve compliance by industry with EU environmental law."
"(PL) Mr President, a number of amendments were proposed during the first reading of the LIFE+ Regulation."
"It was unanimously agreed that this financial instrument fails to meet expectations in the area of environmental protection."
"The main difficulty concerned the restriction of financial resources for implementation of all the policies in this area."
"The financial understandings with the Council and the Commission were not transferred to the environmental protection budget for the next seven years."
"In my view, the difference of approach between Mrs Sinnott and most of the other Members is rather abstract in nature."
"My conscience would be much easier if I voted in favour of this report in the certainty that the resources allocated to the various countries will be devoted to environmental projects."
"The problem is that the funds are being spent on staff and not on environmental projects."
"I believe this is the reason why we really are compelled to intervene in some way."
"To conclude, I should like to say as an aside that at a time of crisis concerning our vision of the Europe of the future, and of scepticism about European institutions, the environment could serve as a true common point of reference for many citizens of European Union Member States."
"(FR) Commissioner, during the first reading, our message concerned the limited funds allocated to LIFE+."
"Today, the European Parliament is interested in sending a clear message to the Council and the Commission."
"Under no circumstances can we accept that 80% of the credits for LIFE+ should be delegated to the Member States for management by national agencies."
"Why is this unacceptable?"
"It is because environmental policy is one of the European policies most highly regarded by Europeans and seen by them as being one of the most transparent."
"One wonders for what possible reason the Commission should want to abandon this opportunity to show people the direct impact of a Community policy on their everyday lives."
"There is no sense in this, particularly at a time when we are being criticised for a lack of communication with citizens."
"LIFE+ is an indispensable financial instrument for all our environmental policies. Yet there is such inconsistency."
"In session after session we are voting for strong environmental commitments in the framework of sustainable development, while LIFE+ is being whittled away."
"In this too, moreover, we are not in agreement with the Council."
"Handing over responsibility for 80% of the funding to the Member States means taking the risk of causing all our commitments to fail and seeing this funding diverted from its initial objective."
"Yes, Commissioner, we are all in favour of LIFE+, but not in the guise that you are proposing."
"We must retain a centralised model managed by the Commission, with projects selected on the basis of their merits and the added value they will bring."
"As you are well aware, we shall otherwise face the watering down of our environmental policy."
"Renationalisation is not the right solution."
"We must use these resources not to pay civil servants but to launch and fund projects."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the nationalisation of LIFE from the outset contradicts the application of this environmental tool to date"
"The proposal to delegate the management of 80% of the admittedly inadequate budget for LIFE+ to the Member States would mean that all the European added value would be lost and, most importantly, that the Member States would be given carte blanche to - possibly - follow national objectives."
"We are therefore calling for efficient and transparent management under the control of the European Commission of important programmes with added European value."
"Finally, if no agreement is reached, I consider it especially important that we support the common proposal, on the basis of which it will be possible to fund activities which will have to be brought under the programme in question from 2007 onwards."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Béguin on her exceptionally positive report."
"Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, that during the first reading Parliament significantly improved the Commission's proposal on LIFE+, particularly with respect to the amount to be included for the funding of Natura 2000."
"I therefore welcome Amendment 18, which restates the sum of EUR 100 million agreed during negotiations on the financial perspective."
"There are, however, some reasons why I am not enthusiastic about Amendment 10, which, for the new Member States, deletes the very important second paragraph of Article 6 of the Council's common position."
"I am afraid that centralised allocation of funding entirely through the projects favours old Member States that are more familiar with the procedures."
"It is common knowledge that institutions of the new Member States are not yet sufficiently prepared to compete with their projects on an equal footing."
"The Commission's proposal that 80% of funding should be allocated to the Member States rectifies this objective initial disadvantage, and detailed eligibility criteria should ensure European added value of funding."
"Seen from this angle, I do not consider it renationalisation."
"With regard to the implementation, I would not object to the Council's solution to the problem."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you have now often enough heard it said that all of us are opposed to this European programme being handed back to the Member States."
"It should remain European."
"Here in this House, we talk about environmental programmes and how to fund them, but we should consider well the way in which we do this."
"It is not acceptable that the habitat programme or the Birds Directive should be used in the Member States to do things that actually go against this House's normal understanding of things."
"Environmental policy should indeed be treated as having the value it does, but frogs are not meant to enjoy more protection than do human beings, and one function of the Commission and of its offices is to maintain the proper sense of proportion in this respect."
"What matters is that we, here in this House, should join with you in the Commission in putting into effect programmes that add European value."
"This must not be about a mere transfer of funds, that is to say giving Member States back their money and leaving it to them what becomes of it."
"Nor is it acceptable that these funds should be used to finance NGOs with whose background and connections we are not familiar."
"We must, then, take care that European taxpayers' money is used properly."
"(DE) Mr President, the second reading of the financial instrument for the environment shows us once more that the Financial Perspective for the period from 2007 to 2013 does not adequately enable the EU to perform its functions as regards the environment, and, indeed, much else besides."
"The fact that we are in such a problematic financial position makes it important that we should, tomorrow, give our rapporteur support in the shape of a massive majority."
"The Commission may well be indicating its willingness to compromise, but we know that the negotiations will be extremely tough, for the amendments that the Commission has this evening declared itself unable to accept are at the very heart of this House's position."
"As has already been said, handing this programme back to the Member States would imperil European environmental policy and the value that Europe adds to it, and it is for that reason that I support all the rapporteur's amendments to delete, for they take us several steps in the right direction."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the determined work by the rapporteur has already produced substantial results at first reading."
"Nevertheless, the resources allocated for LIFE+ for the 2007-2013 period are not sufficient to meet the environmental challenges of the coming years and we therefore risk jeopardising the positive work that has been achieved thus far."
"For this reason, it is particularly important to support the rapporteur's Amendment 3, in order to be able to guarantee more adequate funding, at least after the 2008-2009 review of the Financial Framework, with a view to adapting LIFE to the necessary changes and ensuring a high level of Community cofinancing."
"Furthermore, I would like to underline the significance of the destination of European environment funds, in that they should not be used to make up the financial deficits of the Member States - it has in fact been pointed out many times that they are often used to pay civil servants - but to implement European projects that put the Gothenburg Sustainable Development Strategy into practice."
"Finally, I am glad of the fact that the new LIFE+ programme pays greater attention to the issue of energy efficiency, lending financial support to new technologies, and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to involve civil society to a greater extent in the development phase of both multiannual programmes and annual national programmes."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for their very positive contributions and for the acknowledgement that the initial proposal - adopted by the Commission in September 2004, with the help of Parliament - has been improved considerably."
"What we have to strive for is a balanced solution."
"In this respect, I will try to facilitate an agreement between the Council and Parliament."
"With regard to the amendments, I am aware of 31 amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a further amendment introduced since last week."
"The late amendment, similar to what happened in the budget debate, encourages me to believe that Parliament wishes to help find a solution to the funding gap that the late adoption of LIFE+ will create. While the budget question will ultimately be solved by the budgetary authority, the Commission will do all it can to facilitate an agreement that, with your support, will provide funds to DG Environment throughout 2007."
"Turning now to the 31 amendments on LIFE+, I will divide them into four distinct blocks."
"Firstly, on the delivery method, the Commission cannot accept the group of amendments opposing delegated programme management."
"Secondly, on allocation of funds, the budget, ring-fencing etc., Parliament has tabled an amendment aiming at adding the whole EUR 100 million extra to the LIFE+ instrument."
"If Parliament and the Council were in agreement to allocate that amount to the LIFE+ programme, I would welcome the opportunity to see the programme expanded."
"Parliament also calls for at least 55% of LIFE+ funds to be allocated to the nature and biodiversity component."
"The Commission cannot accept this amendment, since it would reduce the flexibility needed by several Member States to tackle other pressing environmental concerns."
"The 40% in the common position is a minimum and nothing prevents Member States spending double that figure on nature and biodiversity if they so wish and can justify it."
"Thirdly, with regard to comitology issues, the amendments seeking greater involvement by Parliament during the various phases of programming and introducing the regulatory procedure with scrutiny would be acceptable in principle."
"Lastly, with regard to a series of amendments seeking clarification, greater transparency, etc., on questions such as the application of the Aarhus Convention, cross-border projects, specific reference to the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the role of the Commission in supporting integration, etc., my view is that these amendments could be acceptable to the Commission in principle, subject to some drafting changes."
"I should like to repeat what I said earlier, namely that we should continue working together to find practical solutions, especially on the implementation method for LIFE+."
"In addition, together we need to solve the 2007 funding gap."
"I am heartened by Parliament's good wishes in that respect."
"We need a funding instrument for the environment in order to spend our EUR 2 billion budget."
"I am therefore willing to help find a practical compromise between the Council and Parliament on these issues and I am willing to help facilitate such an agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Community civil protection mechanism (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism (recast) C6-0076/2006."
"Μember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, first I wish to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, on drafting an exceptional report."
"The Commission proposal to recast the 2001 Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism takes account of the demand by both the European Parliament and the Council for resources and facilities to be strengthened in the field of civil protection in Europe."
"Its objective is to strengthen the mechanism with the experience acquired from previous emergency situations."
"It provides a basis for the further development of cooperation in the field of civil protection by improving and strengthening the existing project in this sector and by launching new activities."
"We must highlight two innovations which we are proposing: funding for the cost of hiring equipment and of hiring transport means."
"We often face situations in which aid is available but there are no suitable means for taking it to the scene of the disaster."
"As a result, this aid either arrives late or does not arrive at all."
"In the case of emergencies which affect several European countries at once, such as, for example, forest fires in summer, floods in spring and possible simultaneous terrorist threats throughout Europe, the Member States may find it hard to provide help to other Member States, due to their own needs."
"That is why the Commission proposed that a safety net be created at Community level, so that we have the facility to hire the necessary transport means and equipment."
"The Commission, of course, knows that the European Parliament understands the importance of the benefit which will accrue from the reforms in question and expresses its thanks for the support which it has already given to the proposed new funding mechanism."
"As emphasised in the Barnier report, the result of the enhanced cooperation in the field of civil protection will be better protection, both for the citizens of the European Union and for the inhabitants of third countries."
"It will ensure that the Community as a whole can offer more coordinated and more effective and more prompt aid to any country affected by a major disaster."
"I should remind you here that the proposal to hire transport means and equipment was part of the proposal for the new funding mechanism on which Parliament formulated its opinion earlier this year."
"The negotiations which followed in the Council proved to be very difficult."
"That is why we are calling on all the members of the European Parliament who wish to advance this proposal to do what they can at national level to support it; otherwise we shall not be able to achieve the enhanced cooperation in the field of civil protection called for by Parliament."
"Mr President, over recent years we have experienced a tsunami, hurricane Katrina and earthquakes in Pakistan and Indonesia with high death tolls, while in the European Union the Member States have frequently faced major floods and storms, forest fires, disasters at sea and industrial accidents."
"The repercussions of these tragic events are huge not only in terms of human lives, but also to the economy."
"That is why the citizens of the European Union are rightly calling for a more effective approach."
"Improving the European Union's ability to respond to emergency situations is a priority for the European Parliament."
"That is why we are today debating ways of improving the Community civil protection mechanism."
"During the preparation of the committee proposal we are debating, various alternative proposals were examined. One of them was recast, which the Commission chose and which is the least ambitious choice, because it introduces a limited number of improvements to the Council decision governing the civil protection mechanism."
"Could the Commission therefore tell me how it arrived at this choice, the least ambitious choice, despite the repeated announcements by the European Council and the resolutions by the European Parliament on greater and stronger development of the Community civil protection mechanism?"
"The main weaknesses identified in the recast proposal tabled by the Commission relate, firstly, to the transportation of rescue teams and equipment."
"Today every Member State bears responsibility for organising the transportation of its own civil protection aid."
"However, this shortcoming undermines the effectiveness of European aid."
"In 2005 alone, in five emergencies, Member States were unable to send experts and equipment, because they did not have the means to transport aid where it was needed."
"I think that the Commission needs to do more to address this problem."
"The second weakness relates to the development of a European rapid response capability."
"Today, Community civil protection aid is provided by the Member States on a voluntary basis."
"This does not add up to the European rapid response capability demanded by the European Parliament."
"In its communication on 25 April, the Commission proposed the creation of special standby modules which would be mobilised on request by the competent European authority."
"I ask you, why did the Commission not include its own proposal in the recast?"
"The third problem relates to early warning."
"The ability of the European Commission to respond to natural disasters also depends upon the existence of early warning systems."
"The recast states that the Monitoring and Information Centre in Brussels should be linked to the systems of the Member States and international organisations."
"That is good, but it is not enough because, immediately after the earthquake caused by the tsunami, the governments learned, but the citizens never learned."
"That is why a suitable legal basis must be set up within the framework of the Council decision, so that early warning systems can be developed within the framework of the mechanism."
"The fourth weakness concerns the coordination of interventions in third countries."
"In this sector also more work needs to be done, because there is a blatant lack of coordination."
"Some Member States work constantly through the Community mechanism, some Member States prefer to work with the United Nations, some Member States work with both and some Member States with neither."
"This fragmentation and lack of coordination completely contradict the ambitious announcements by the European Council."
"As rapporteur, together with the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups, we tabled amendments which were approved almost unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"In brief, they relate to information for citizens, to the integration of civil protection measures in education programmes and advertising campaigns, to land management and use, in order to strengthen prevention, to the definitions of terms based on the agreed international terminology, to the inclusion of public health and to the use of military means on an auxiliary and voluntary basis."
"Finally, I should like to mention the Barnier report on the creation of Europe Aid."
"In January 2006, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council asked Michel Barnier to examine the role of the European Union in dealing with crises."
"It turned out to be a very detailed report with interesting proposals."
"Unfortunately, however, both the Commission and the Council simply welcomed the report as an important contribution and did nothing about it."
"I should like the Commissioner to tell me how the Commission intends to make use of the Barnier report."
"The price of the lack of a unified and effective Europe when it comes to crisis management is very high, which is why we need to proceed more effectively and with greater coordination."
"Mr President, the Council decision being approved, with our adopted amendments, is the product of an exhaustive preparatory procedure and of the experience acquired over recent years from dealing with natural and man-made disasters, disasters which, apart from their huge impact on every aspect of citizens' every day lives, revealed objective shortcomings in the capacity for national intervention and, hence, enhanced expectations for Community assistance."
"We are therefore being called upon today to strengthen and arm the Union so that it can respond to this demand by the citizens for effective intervention in the fields of the prevention of and rapid response to natural and man-made disasters."
"This is therefore an expression of the real solidarity sought between the Member States, which will further strengthen the feeling of participation in a community and will thus further strengthen the European conscience."
"As far as the amendments to the initial proposal are concerned, I consider it necessary to draw your attention to the following points:"
"An effective early warning and response system is founded on the following four components: identifying and assessing risks, constantly monitoring them, a warning and communication mechanism and, lastly, preparedness - the capacity to react and assist."
"I too, like the rapporteur, should like to emphasise that the amendments which we tabled concern matters such as the early warning system, standby modules from the participating states, response and citizen information guidelines, best practices for dealing with situations and, lastly, mutual consular assistance for determining contact points between Member States."
"I should also like to say - and I think that this should be accepted - that we must pay special attention to the public health sector, because disasters are usually accompanied by dangers to public health, either as a result of a lack of food or water or from epidemics and, consequently, this component should also be included in the proposal."
"Finally, I should like to observe, as our rapporteur said, that the Barnier report is an exceptional report, which should be taken into account because, otherwise, what was the point in doing all this exceptional work?"
"I think that, together with your report today, we shall have an effective mechanism."
"To close, I should like to thank our rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Congratulations, Mr Papadimoulis."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Papadimoulis on his report and the Commission on its initiative."
"The EU has at its disposal various legal mechanisms for preventing, and responding to, natural disasters."
"There are indeed a number of Parliament resolutions to this effect."
"I myself drew up a report on the European strategy for responding to natural disasters on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in which I advocated the need for the Union to have quicker and more effective resources for responding to serious emergencies."
"On the basis of the experience of recent years with the forest fires in southern Europe and the floods in Central Europe, the creation of detection and early warning systems to protect the citizens and their property from natural disasters, including earthquakes and tsunamis, has become a priority."
"Although responsibility for managing the response to natural disasters rests primarily with the country affected, with the Union playing a supporting role, the Community civil protection mechanism set up in 2001 lacked resources and powers. In other words, it fell short of what was needed."
"This recast, improved proposal is worthy of praise. It will lead to better coordination and quicker assistance for the people affected."
"More needs to be done, however, and the model needs to be perfected, not only on the basis of the Barnier report, but also the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, of which I should like to highlight the following: cooperation in civil protection should be based on a European strategic coordination centre responsible for gathering and disseminating information on emergencies and for providing additional resources for rapid intervention to fight natural disasters; the involvement of communities in prevention and response, for which they will need training and information; and greater investment in training the assistance intervention teams."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his excellent work."
"His report translates in practical terms that which has already been provided for in the report on the Solidarity Fund, which represents the legal and financial basis for intervention in the field of civil protection."
"The European Union currently has financial means and new knowledge based on the experience of the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, created in 2001, which will enable us to improve the instrument's practicality and effectiveness."
"It is true that the emergency response to disasters must come first and foremost from the local level, with prevention and reconstruction measures, but it is also true that there is a need for crisis management measures, which can and should be coordinated at European level, if we want to achieve significant economies of scale and, above all, greater efficiency."
"Furthermore, when the scale of a disaster overwhelms the local or even national capacity to react, it would be desirable to be able to provide rapid additional assistance from other countries, using their available skills and resources."
"We should in fact bear in mind that in many cases major disasters have effects that transcend borders, having an impact on the territories of neighbouring countries."
"In addition, I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of proper and appropriate planning of land use and of prevention and management of disasters with a view to reducing risks."
"There is a need to strengthen the European civil protection system, in order to be able to provide coordinated responses to tackle emergencies and contribute to a European Union capable of giving its own citizens confidence and safety."
"I believe that we have to learn to live up to these legitimate expectations."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we all learn from the past and from our own experiences, and I believe that disaster prevention is one area in which we do this."
"The documents you have submitted and Mr Papadimoulis' outstanding report represent an attempt by us at putting these experiences to good use."
"Three aspects need to be considered: firstly, the preventive measures; secondly, interventions in a crisis situation, and, thirdly, how to deal with the aftermath."
"While the European Union can afford a great deal in the way of preventive measures, it is an unfortunate fact that disasters strike in a variety of regions and for various reasons, so it is of the utmost importance that we, here in the European Union, should learn from one another."
"It is in this respect that the European Union has a particular task to perform."
"During interventions to deal with a crisis situation, the Union must discharge its particular role as a coordinator."
"The Member States must not be discharged from their responsibilities; the prevention of disasters is and remains a national responsibility, and it is for that reason that I take an extremely critical view of the EU's current acquisition of equipment, which represents what might be termed an attempt at duplication, and certainly is not beneficial."
"It is important that duplication should be avoided, and we should concentrate on good coordination of the resources present in the Member States in order to do that."
"The next stage is dealing with the fallout, and a crisis response instrument - in the shape of the Solidarity Fund - has already been put in place by the European Union in order to do this."
"Here, too, we should consider how more efficient use may be made of it, possibly by changing the basic rates and concentrating on dealing only with crises that affect Europe as a whole."
"(EL) Mr President, the protection of European citizens from accidents and natural disasters is directly connected to their economic and social security."
"Over recent years, there has been a huge increase in the number of natural disasters, resulting in an equally huge increase in requests for assistance from the civil protection mechanism on the part of the governments of the Member States."
"Civil protection is a complex system which consists of prevention, intervention and, lastly, restoration."
"The excellent report by Mr Papadimoulis on the proposed recast does, I think, improve the Council proposal in a way which strengthens the supportive and supplementary actions by the Union when they are needed."
"However, I stand by the ongoing need for instruction of the parties involved and I consider that greater information for the public is needed, especially in areas with a high degree of risk, in order to help improve prevention and preparedness in the areas in question."
"Μember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their excellent comments."
"Before I touch on the matter of the amendments, I should like to reply on the question of the Barnier report and to say that the Commission has already started work on many of the issues connected with this report, the most important, of course, being the development of civil protection modules."
"Meetings have been held with specialists from the Member States in order to ascertain what types of modules should be available in each case and the specific terms and conditions for each type of module."
"A second field of work relates to exercises and, despite the fact that no provision is made for the creation of a European institute in accordance with the Barnier report, we do nonetheless propose that a network of centres should be developed which will extend the existing exercise programme."
"We also agree that the Monitoring and Information Centre should be reinforced. We have already requested an increase in the number of employees, of officers, to be employed at the centre."
"We have also asked the Member States to give us the opportunity next year to use certain specialists at the MIC."
"Finally, the Commission has two legislative proposals, one for the means of financing and one for the recast of the 2001 decision, which will give us the possibility of working in another sector, the transport sector, about which I spoke earlier."
"Now, as far as the amendments are concerned, the European Parliament has presented a series of important amendments with a view to strengthening civil protection capabilities at European level."
"The amendments relate to the need to safeguard prompt transportation of civil protection aid, the importance of early warning and alert systems, the interoperability of civil protection modules and the role which the mechanism can play in helping the citizens of the European Union."
"The Commission can accept most of the proposed amendments."
"However, there are some which cause problems and cannot be adopted as they stand."
"I refer to those relating to the provision of measures relating to prevention, public health and deliberate maritime pollution."
"As regards the measures relating to prevention, the Commission wishes to emphasise that the proposal for the means of financing civil protection will cover actions in this sector."
"The Community civil protection mechanism is designed to cover actions in the sectors of preparedness and intervention only."
"Nonetheless, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament about the importance of actions in the field of prevention and has promised to promote them within an appropriate framework."
"As regards the inclusion of public health, the Commission recognises that civil protection actions very often aim to protect public health."
"However, the civil protection mechanism set up at European Union level does not form part of public health policy, which is covered by other existing Community mechanisms, such as the Community action programme in the health sector."
"As far as deliberate or intentional maritime pollution is concerned, the Commission fully supports the proposal whereby it must be possible for the civil protection mechanism to intervene in cases of extensive maritime pollution caused either accidentally or deliberately."
"The proposal by the European Commission to extend the scope so that it also covers man-made disasters covers this possibility."
"However, the term 'intentional, deliberate' maritime pollution usually refers to the jettisoning of small quantities of oil from ships and the Commission wishes to avoid the interpretation that the scope of the regulation covers jettisoning to such a minor degree."
"It would be practically impossible for the Commission to mobilise the mechanism - nor, as I said earlier, does it have the staff - and this sort of minor jettisoning should be dealt with by the means available to each country."
"That is why the corresponding amendments were not accepted."
"Finally, the Commission would point out that a series of amendments relates to aspects of existing legislation."
"The Commission supports some of these amendments in essence."
"However, the interinstitutional agreement on the use of the recast technique does not allow the Commission to accept them, unless they are of vital importance to the application of the new provisions contained in the proposal or derive directly from the new provisions."
"However, the Commission will bear the issues in question in mind within the framework of the development of our policy in this sector."
"These are the main issues on which the Commission's position differs from that taken in the European Parliament report."
"However, I wish to stress that these differences of opinion do not overshadow our common objectives."
"We agree fully with the ambition of the European Parliament to develop a very strong European intervention capability in the field of civil protection, both inside and outside the European Union, and we thank you for your support."
"I shall send the European Parliament secretariat a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments."
"I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, on his excellent work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(SV) The European Parliament is now dealing with a proposal for revising the Civil Protection Mechanism set up in 2001."
"There is no doubt that disasters put great strains on the parties affected."
"Coordinated European civil protection is not, however, the solution to the problem, especially in the form in which it appears in this proposal."
"Civil protection in each Member State is funded through taxes."
"It is up to each State to choose how tax revenue collected from its citizens is to be distributed."
"This proposal may entail a risk of certain Member States choosing to invest a minimum of resources in national civil protection, relying on other EU countries contributing when a disaster occurs."
"This problem of free-riding is very serious and is unfair towards people in those countries that choose to have strong civil protection."
"Where international efforts are concerned, these should be coordinated through OCHA and funded by the Member States and not by the EU."
"The Commission's document also talks about rapid reaction forces and about the Member States having to give notice of available resources, including military resources and military capacity, in cases where an affected country requests that type of aid."
"The June List resolutely objects to these proposals."
"A country's military resources are a matter for that particular nation, and it is up to each Member State to decide whether or not such resources should be mobilised."
"European order for payment procedure (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Council common position (07535/3/2006 C6-0227/2006 for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European order for payment procedure (Rapporteur: Arlene McCarthy)."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, almost 12 months ago we first gave our approval to the European payment order, a new law to assist in simplified debt recovery for businesses and citizens owed money in another EU Member State."
"Today, a year later, the committee's view has not changed."
"We believe that we need this pragmatic and practical EU law, in particular to ensure that businesses and citizens have an affordable system to recover those debts owed to them."
"Why?"
"Because until this law comes into force, recovery of debts from another EU State is a costly legal process."
"In some cases, money spent on lawyers and administrative costs exceeds the amount owed to the individual."
"More significantly, studies and experience show that companies which do not get their debts paid are at risk of collapsing, with knock-on effects not just in terms of job losses, but also for other SMEs in the supply chain."
"Out of between 30 and 40 billion invoices in Europe each year, as many as 1 billion default and turn into debt cases."
"Interim Justicia carried out a survey on payment practices in 16 European countries some 10 years ago."
"The average delay then was just 14 days."
"By the end of 2003, however, this had not declined, but risen to 16 days."
"According to a World Bank study, 'Doing Business in 2004: Understanding Regulation', the Nordic countries have the most efficient and effective legal systems of the countries surveyed."
"They take the least time to reach a solution while keeping costs low."
"Italy is one of the countries with the longest delays worldwide."
"The explanation it is said lies in the lax appeal process, which allows proceedings to be disrupted at any point during a trial."
"Spain, by contrast, has one of the most complex legal systems, which generates higher costs and leads to longer court proceedings."
"My own Member State, the UK, has some three systems operating for payments, again creating confusion for businesses or the public."
"Extensive differences in legal regulation of overdue payment recovery therefore lead to uncertainties, especially in EU trade, and the additional costs prevent the EU's aim of equal opportunities for market access for both local and EU operating companies."
"It is clear that a lack of enforcement systems for payments undermines the internal market and business confidence and that, as a result, SMEs have continued to experience cash flow problems caused by late payments."
"The European payment order will also apply to individual citizens who work or live in another Member State and who can also take advantage of this new law."
"Of course, the high and expanding volume of trade within the EU and the increased movement of people raise the likelihood that more and more businesses may become involved in cross-border litigation."
"There is a risk that citizens may not be inclined to assert their rights because of the obstacles they face, particularly in dealing with the legal system in another Member State and with unfamiliar procedures and unknown costs."
"It is essential, therefore, that the EU provide for a judicial area where private individuals and businesses can have access to justice and redress in the case of an uncontested claim."
"This procedural law will help facilitate that access."
"The payment order introduces a practical EU-level instrument for obtaining an enforceable decision and I believe in this way we can demonstrate to citizens that the EU is delivering a practical tool to assist them with redress and remedies."
"I want to put on record my thanks to members of the committee, in particular the shadows, Mr Wieland, who is here this evening, and Mrs Wallis, who cannot be here."
"They have not only supported my approach but have made useful and constructive proposals for amendments at every stage of the procedure."
"The committee consulted with key protagonists and we believe we focused on the core issues."
"Both my shadows were concerned to ensure that the forms and the annex, the bones of the proposal, were simple enough for businesses to be able to fill them out with minimum bureaucracy."
"Only time and experience will tell if this has been achieved."
"That is why, under the new comitology procedures, Parliament needs to be consulted and informed of any changes the Commission would like to make to the system."
"I would also like to thank the British Presidency, in particular the Minister Baroness Ashton, who was instrumental in helping us to make progress on the clear drafting of this law."
"So now, Commissioner, at second reading we are down to the last few details."
"Mrs Wallis is concerned that the Commission should seriously address the potential discrimination affecting citizens and businesses where EEA members can participate in the single market, but cannot be a party to the EPO."
"I hope the Commission will address this issue."
"The forms should be user-friendly and simple and we would therefore like the Commission to take on board our amendment in this area."
"Finally, since we started this process a year ago and since the Commission's original proposal, we now have a new institutional agreement, with effect from July 2006."
"The committee and Parliament insist that the new regulatory scrutiny procedure and rule should be respected in this legislation and on the payment order."
"Commissioner, let me say how much we have appreciated the cooperation of your departments in this area."
"I hope that, together with the Finnish Presidency, we can sign off the European payment order and begin the process of putting it into law across all the Member States of the EU, so that businesses and citizens can be confident of operating in the internal market in the knowledge that the failure to pay a debt does not end up in endless court proceedings with no outcome."
"Thanks to the European Union, there is now a simple and user-friendly system for speedy payment of debts which, I believe, will drive forward the internal market for SMEs and boost the EU economy."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, warmly for her work and her efforts to bring this project, which is very important for our citizens, to a satisfactory conclusion."
"Like the rapporteur, I would also like to thank the former United Kingdom Presidency, particularly Baroness Ashton, for the work done in moving ahead with this important project."
"As you know, this regulation on the European order for payment procedure aims at facilitating the mass recovery of uncontested claims in Europe."
"It is thus very important, as it will allow all creditors in Europe to recover their claims in a uniform way and more rapidly and cheaply than in ordinary court proceedings."
"It will also alleviate the burden on the courts by removing from ordinary proceedings those claims where the debtor does not contest the debt."
"The proposal potentially concerns all citizens and economic operators in Europe."
"A European order for payment can circulate freely in Europe and will be enforced automatically."
"There will be therefore no need to request a declaration of enforcement - the 'exequatur' - in the Member State of enforcement."
"Concerning the amendments, I can accept the third amendment as proposed."
"On the second amendment, I can accept the compromise amendment on the comitology procedure, which is in line with the Council decision taken in July 2006."
"On the first amendment, while I understand the reason and the concern expressed by the committee, I think that we should not at this stage reopen the question of the definition of a cross-border case, adopted at first reading by the Council and the European Parliament."
"At the same time, I can confirm that the Commission is available and willing to look more closely into the effects of the regulation for parties domiciled in third countries and, in particular, states of the European Economic Area."
"I am ready to give very careful consideration to any proposals."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has set out the essentials of why this matters in economic terms."
"This European order for payment procedure represents a major step forward in the application of laws across borders, and, in particular, a step forward for business, which has a particular interest in the legal soundness of claims being established without delay, in the prompt assignment of title, and in this claim being capable of being enforced, without further cost-intensive procedures, in the country of the debtor."
"It has to be said, though - and it is to this that I want to give particular attention - that legal relationships across borders will become increasingly important to private citizens, who find it particularly difficult to enforce claims across borders, whether such claims are contentious or not."
"Today, it is undisputed claims that we are discussing, and that is why this first step is so important."
"Private individuals find the business of getting what they are entitled to complicated enough as it is, and they have serious problems with getting claims enforced in a country other than their own; this instrument will make things easier for them."
"A form that even an ordinary member of the public can complete will make it possible for claims to be enforced relatively simply and without great expense."
"Another consideration is that constant reference has been made to businesses and to creditors, but not enough has been said about the debtors."
"Systems have been introduced in the Member States of the European Union - not least in the one from which I come - to make the establishment of such claims a positively economical business, not least for those who owe the money."
"The debtor who is willing - but perhaps not able - to pay up, can agree reasonable repayments with the creditor, who has an interest in establishing title and thereby preventing the debt from lapsing, and, in the absence of a contested case, fewer costs are incurred."
"It is therefore in the interests of all parties that we should make cross-border legal proceedings speedy, efficient and affordable."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, late payments are the main cause of insolvency, which threatens the survival of businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones."
"They jeopardise the operations and solvency of these businesses, often resulting in the loss of many jobs."
"Swift and efficient debt recovery when no legal dispute is involved is therefore vitally important for business entities in the European Union."
"It helps to preserve jobs."
"The Member States have attempted to solve the problem of large-scale debt recovery in the case of undisputed claims, generally by simplifying proceedings regarding payment orders."
"There are, however, significant differences between national provisions and the way individual procedures operate."
"As a result, the latter may be inadmissible or impossible to apply in cross-border situations."
"It is therefore appropriate to respond positively to the proposed regulation setting up a European procedure for payment orders."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 10.20 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"
"You wish to take the floor, Mr Carnero González."
"I imagine that it is for a point of order."
"On the basis of which Rule do you wish to speak?"
"(ES) Yes, Mr President, I simply wished to mention the fact that the media is reporting that a European citizen, of Spanish nationality, Mr Emilio Morenatti, has been kidnapped in Gaza this morning by a group of armed men."
"I would ask that you call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to do everything they can ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"That is not a point of order."
"I understand your concern, but the Rules of Procedure must be respected."
"I take good note of what you say, thank you."

"Decision on urgent procedure"
"The Council is requesting the application of the urgent procedure with regard to the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets registered in the Community outermost regions C6-0295/2006."
"Who will speak on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries?"
"(ES) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries in the absence of its chairman, Mr Morillon, in order to support this Council request for urgent procedure."
"We are talking about approving, as you have said, and as the Commission proposes, the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 on the management of fishing fleets."
"The fisheries sector in the outermost regions is suffering a structurally precarious situation."
"The Council's approval of the Regulation on the European Fisheries Fund was accompanied by a joint statement by the Council and the Commission in support of these regions, extending until 31 December 2006 the derogations regarding the possibility of granting State aid for the renewal of the fishing fleets registered in those regions."
"Although the extension ends in two months' time, the Regulation has not been able to enter into force due to the slow pace of the process for adopting decisions within Community legislation."
"Our committee is in favour of the urgent procedure and urges the Commission and the Member States to adopt the measures necessary to ensure that the sector can receive the aid without delay."
"(Parliament agreed to the urgent procedure)"
"This item is therefore included in next Thursday's Voting Time at 11.30 a.m. and the time limit for presentation of amendments is tomorrow Wednesday at 10.00 a.m."
"Commemoration of the 1956 Hungarian uprising"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to make a statement, and I shall do so standing, on the 'Hungarian Revolution' of October 1956."
"Half a century ago, the Hungarian people rose up against the Communist dictatorship and against the occupation by a foreign power."
"On 23 October 1956, Hungarian university students took to the streets of Budapest to protest against the Communist government and they were soon joined by citizens from all professions and sectors of society."
"I must tell you that that is my earliest childhood memory of politics."
"At that time, the news in my country was full of the resistance by the Hungarian people."
"I can remember our school teacher showing us where the events were taking place on a map, the voices on the radio and photographs in the newspapers of burnt-out T-34 tanks in the centre of Budapest."
"It brought alive in me for the first time the notion of fighting for freedom."
"For two weeks there was hope; then the radios stopped and a complete silence fell, and behind that silence thousands were killed and hundreds exiled."
"For some time those who rose up in Budapest hoped that the free West would come to their aid. It did not."
"For some time, they were led to believe that it would."
"We looked on as powerless spectators as thousands of Hungarian men, women and children fled their country and sought refuge in the West."
"It was an indescribable tragedy for the Hungarian people, but it was also the first chink in the armour of the Soviet system - a chink that would grow and would lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall - and it was undoubtedly a great moment in the history of that country."
"Around that time, at the end of June, the Poznan uprising in Poland, with the workers from the Cigielski factory demanding 'bread and freedom', was another significant moment in that upheaval."
"Those events were undoubtedly related."
"In fact, during the ceremony organised this year to commemorate the events in Poznan in 1956, the Hungarian President, Laszlo Sólyom, said that 'Poznan and Hungary rose up together against the Soviet occupation."
"On 24 October 1956 the Hungarians took to the streets carrying placards reading ""Poznan - Warsaw - Budapest”'."
"That was a source of inspiration for what happened later, although it took a long time."
"It took a long time, until the spring came in Prague in 1968."
"It took a long time, until the strikes in Poland in 1970, which led to the recognition of Solidarnosc, ten years later, which was the pickaxe that brought the wall down."
"History repeated itself in 1989."
"Hungary and Poland laid the first stone of the reunification of the continent, and I believe that this is a good point to quote from Albert Camus in 1957, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution."
"Camus said: 'Hungary conquered and in chains has done more for freedom and justice than any other European people for twenty years [...]."
"In Europe's isolation today, we have only one way of being true to Hungary, and that is never to betray, among ourselves, or anywhere, what the Hungarian heroes died for and never to condone, even indirectly, what killed them."
"It would indeed be difficult for us to be worthy of such sacrifices."
"We can, however, try to be so, in uniting Europe at last, in forgetting our quarrels, in correcting our own errors, in increasing our efforts and our solidarity'."
"A reunified Europe today is prepared to make further progress and to disseminate the European spirit even further, thereby helping to create a world in which our actions are guided by the principles of freedom, solidarity and progress."
"We owe that to those who died for their belief in a free Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are, today, commemorating the uprising by the people of Hungary 50 years ago, when people rose up in desperation against a totalitarian dictatorship."
"We are commemorating the events of the autumn of 1956 today because what they did, they did for all of us."
"They did the idea of freedom, justice and democracy proud."
"They stood up for human dignity and filled it with renewed vigour, continuing to demonstrate it even when they were crushed by tanks."
"They went into exile for all of us, suffered for all of us, thus to be borne in remembrance for all of us over the years and the decades."
"The heroes of the Hungarian revolution are heroes for us all."
"They are heroes for Europe."
"We are commemorating them today because we are indebted to their legacy."
"We are paying homage to their achievement because we - especially here in the European Parliament - are bound to one another by the pledge that there must never again be such a challenge to freedom and human dignity in Europe."
"Their life stands before us like a relief showing the great heights that humanity is capable of reaching when we are compelled to defend the values and the dignity of Europe."
"We bow down before them."
"What began with the first mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October 1956 and ended when Soviet troops were sent in on 4 November was a revolution for freedom."
"The participants in the Hungarian uprising quite rightly spoke of revolution, or forradalom."
"By contrast, the Communists who were in power at the time accused them - wrongly - of mounting a counter-revolution, or ellenforradalom."
"The difference is not simply a small fragment of a Hungarian word."
"The difference is enormous."
"It is the difference between freedom and serfdom."
"The people of Hungary acted for our values in Europe, since the freedom for which the heroes of the Hungarian uprising of 1956 strove and died is a part of the European identity."
"Our aims are the aims of those people in Hungary back then."
"Nothing could better illuminate the potency of these events than the fact that, today, we are commemorating the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and that we have with us in this House freely-elected Hungarian MEPs."
"For me, this will always be the miracle of my generation."
"Hungary's freedom has become the freedom of Europe, and Europe's freedom remains the guarantor of Hungary's freedom."
"Allow me just to express my great appreciation, in the light of today's events in Budapest and in Hungary, to the Hungarian Members of this House, irrespective of the groups to which they belong, for the fact that they have made it possible for us to agree on a common text, a joint resolution."
"This shows us that we share common principles that bind us together irrespective of the disagreements of everyday politics."
"I ask that, in the altercations in Budapest, no side should act disproportionately, that the demonstrators should not receive a disproportionate response, since we are linked by common values, namely the values of freedom, which also link us to 1956, as well as linking us in the modern day, 2006."
"Let us always, in every disagreement, put this sharing of values at the heart of things."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a connection between the anniversary that we are commemorating today, namely the anniversary of the Hungarian uprising against their Soviet oppressors, and the anniversary that we will be celebrating next spring, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome."
"These two events took place within a short space of time and both of them were motivated by the same spirit."
"The Treaties of Rome were characterised by the spirit of freedom and the binding together of peoples in freedom."
"This was precisely the spirit of the uprising in Hungary too."
"The people of Hungary wanted out of a system that had been forced upon them; they wanted their own sovereignty as a free people."
"They had to fight that system and struggle against a power that wanted to take that right away from them."
"Fifty years later we are commemorating those men and women who sought out the right that we, the European Union, today guarantee to each people, namely the right to be able to live in freedom and self-determination within the democratic international community."
"Those men and women who had to fight their oppressors for that right are true heroes of European history."
"They had no weapons, they could not resist an army and they faced the tanks with their bare hands and their chests torn open - we all know the pictures."
"The courage shown by these men and women is worthy of our admiration."
"In my opinion, that courage, and the stance that was, as both the previous speaker and you, Mr President, have pointed out, to be found not only in Hungary but also in Poland and twelve years later in Czechoslovakia, that courage is also part of the heritage of Europe."
"It shows that on this continent, men and women have always been prepared to dedicate their lives to freedom."
"The courage of those men and women is up there with the best that Hungary has to offer Europe."
"It is also up there with the best that we as Europeans have to preserve."
"I believe that the fall of the Wall that came later, the fact that it was possible to tear down the Wall, to overcome the Iron Curtain, grew out of the courage of the days that we are remembering today."
"One thing is completely clear, and that is that however bitter oppression may be in any particular case, however painful a dictatorship, it will not last forever."
"No oppression can keep down the desire of a people for freedom, the desire of humankind for freedom, in the long run."
"Every dictatorship yet in the history of humanity has fallen at some point."
"Just as this communist, Stalinist dictatorship fell, so will the other dictatorships in the world."
"This means that the courage of those men and women in Hungary fifty years ago is the courage of men and women in other parts of the world who are fighting oppression in their own lives today."
"This is an ongoing fight; it is not over."
"By commemorating these events on the 50th anniversary we are also commemorating the fact that the people of Hungary have succeeded, having achieved their democracy and their freedom in their country, in transforming the act that forced them into the Eastern Bloc into an act of freedom whereby, through free self-determination, they have joined the European Union."
"What that represents is a completely different concept, namely that of voluntarily joining an international community through free self-determination rather than being forcibly pushed into a community of force."
"It is precisely this that is the giant step forward that we have made in Europe over the last 50 years."
"This uprising took place when I was a little baby, just 10 months old."
"I was a child in 1956."
"The fact that I have been able to live my life in freedom is an enormous privilege, an advantage that the Hungarians of my generation did not have."
"I am grateful for this, but I am even happier that, at this point in my life, we who were born in freedom in Western Europe are today able to live together, as Europeans, with those born under oppression, in the Union in which we share."
"There could be no finer gift for my generation here and in Hungary."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to pay homage to the 1956 Hungarian revolution, to the courage, to the determination of the Hungarian people in the fight for freedom, to the memory of the victims of repression and to the suffering of an entire people."
"1956 was a turning point in the contemporary history of Europe."
"In June 1956, as the President has said, the uprising of Polish workers in Poznań was met with bloody repression."
"The liberalisation of the regime, which took place in Poland in October 1956, lasted only a short time."
"That year was marked by the events in Hungary."
"The Hungarian revolution was popular, national and anticommunist."
"It was crushed mercilessly by the Soviet army."
"The streets of Budapest were the scene of a bloody repression, and Hungary was gripped by terror and oppression for a long time."
"Today we are commemorating this anniversary without trying to settle our scores with the past."
"But in order to inscribe these events in the history of European freedom, and to feel a sense of community, the European Union needs to have a common memory."
"The heroism of the men and women of 1956 cannot be forgotten."
"We must remember Imre Nagy, a communist who became a protagonist of the anticommunist revolution, who was assassinated in a secretive and cowardly manner."
"We must remember István Bibó, a great thinker and man of action in the service of freedom and democracy, who was thrown into prison and condemned to silence until the end of his days."
"We must not forget that Europe, faced with the drama of 1956, certainly expressed its indignation, but remained silent and impotent."
"This is a lesson for Europe now and in the future."
"It must be strong, united, and show solidarity."
"It must find its raison d'être in freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the rights of peoples."
"And for Hungary, today, we should hope that the Hungarian people and its leaders will draw from the courage of 1956 the strength to find the wisdom needed to put the public good and the common interest above political controversies."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, there are a number of red threads running through history, and it is one of those red threads that we are taking hold of here."
"It started on 17 June 1953 in Germany, then ran through Poland and Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, until Communism was finally defeated."
"The Hungarian uprising was an uprising for democracy; it was a national uprising, but also a political one."
"I would remind you of the Petőfi group - the Hungarian intellectuals who founded the Workers' Councils together with the workers, first in Budapest and then throughout Hungary."
"They had the hope to try to reinvent democracy."
"That is what happened in Hungary in 1956."
"As we remember this uprising now, 50 years on, we can also add to that memory another one, namely the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hannah Arendt."
"She was one of those intellectuals who had the courage to name two totalitarian regimes in a single breath - communism and fascism."
"This is precisely what history teaches us: we have never had a permanent hold on democracy."
"We will only keep hold of it if we fight for it every day."
"Poland and Hungary are showing us that today, as are the dangerous developments in France, where there are fascist, far-right forces at work."
"We must continue to stand up and fight for democracy."
"The people of Hungary and Poland 50 years ago and those of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and also the people in this country who fought against fascism, have shown us that it is sometimes necessary to give one's life for democracy and freedom."
"We should take this lesson to heart, and not be afraid to say that totalitarianism - whether fascist or communist - is and always will be totalitarianism."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I express a point of view largely shared by my group when I say that I agree that the 1956 uprising in Hungary should be considered first and foremost as a popular uprising for freedom and independence."
"I also agree that the bloody repression of this uprising by the Soviet army should be unreservedly condemned."
"Finally, I agree that this Hungarian tragedy should be seen as an emblematic event, because it sheds light on the heart of the existential crisis of a model which would disappear thirty-three years later, as it was unable to reform itself profoundly."
"By contrast, we cannot accept a unilateral reading of contemporary history that demonises the communist idea."
"To stay with the case of Hungary, I would remind you that high-ranking communists played a major role in that country in the movement contesting the regime."
"We are all familiar with the part played by Nagy Imre, the reforming communist Prime Minister who paid with his life for his commitment to the side of the insurgents."
"It is less well known that the famous Petofi circle, whose activities are considered as one of the trigger factors of the movement, was formed on the initiative of young communists."
"I could go on to cite the name of the great communist philosopher György Lukács, who was also involved in this struggle for reform."
"In fact, over a whole period, we witnessed a rising tide of protests inspired by communists, whose criticisms were unfortunately stifled."
"History was not written in advance, it is no more so today."
"And so, let us condemn Stalinist crimes as much as necessary, but let us not rekindle the spirit of the cold war which was never productive for freedom and independence in any area."
"The reunified Europe has more to achieve by turning resolutely towards the future."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over 2 500 tanks against an unarmed people, 75 000 Red Army soldiers, thousands of victims, over 2 000 people shot by the Kádár government instated by the Soviets, 12 000 prisoners sent to gulags, 200 000 refugees: these are a few of the terrifying figures that sum up a nation's tragedy, but also the beginning of the end for a party and a power which, following the shameful and iniquitous Yalta agreements, dominated half of our continent."
"The first signs came in Berlin in 1953, followed by the cry for freedom in Poznań, in Poland, in 1956."
"Stalin had been dead for three years, but his political successors, despite Khrushchev's report to the XX Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956 denouncing the Georgian dictator's innumerable crimes, used repressive and criminal methods, for fear that power should slip from their hands in Hungary."
"The revolt descended into a great tragedy."
"Imre Nagy's reformist government was swept aside, and he was assassinated."
"Only with the fall of Soviet communism could the victims of those years finally be rehabilitated. Referred to by Hungarian communist leaders and the Kominform as a 'rabble', in fact, they were and they remain a symbol of human dignity, oppressed by one of the most insensitive and violent dictatorships that history has ever known."
"This great tragedy must remind us today of the negativity of an ideology and a political practice that left millions of victims in the regions of the world in which the regime was installed."
"Some of those who, at the time, defended the use of tanks and the shootings are today reappraising their actions, and, as always, they speak of mistakes."
"They do not speak, however, of rejecting those ideas that led and inevitably lead to dictatorship and oppression."
"Only by rejecting and condemning those ideas quite openly can we be guaranteed a future of freedom."
"Remembering the tragedy of the Hungarian autumn, we appreciate the Union once more as a protector against any humiliation of the dignity of the individual and of peoples."
"Furthermore, we recall that there are still regimes that exert an iron grip on the lives of their citizens and that represent a threat to free peoples: the world's many dictatorships, from North Korea to Iran and Cuba."
"Yet we also remember the dangers of new forms of fundamentalism."
"May the West never again choose silence, and may Europe be a champion of freedom and justice."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, today, we in this House are commemorating a tragic political event that took place in Hungary 50 years ago."
"The insurrection that broke out at that time, and that was brutally crushed by Soviet troops, has opened the eyes of many in Western Europe to the dangers of the Communist ideology as dictated by Moscow."
"The historical significance of Budapest 1956 is much more than local or national."
"As a 13-year-old schoolboy, all that I grasped was that my mother's beloved home country fought a heroic battle for a freedom that it passionately desired."
"The images of Prime Minister Imre Nagy and General Pál Maléter and the fight against the Russian tanks are etched on my mind."
"We desperately - against better judgment, indeed - hoped that the West would send support."
"We felt so much for the victims and for the refugees."
"My parents taught me back then that Hungary is not an Eastern European, but a Central European, country, with strong, religious and cultural ties with Western Europe."
"Now, 50 years down the line, the Soviet bloc has been dismantled and eight, and soon ten, of the former satellite states, are part of the European Union."
"What have we done with this regained freedom?"
"National Socialism was defeated in 1945 and Communism 45 years later."
"Did anything positive come to replace them?"
"Are we able, on the ruins of those ideologies, to build a society of tolerance, accountability and love of one's neighbour?"
"We need patience and perseverance to achieve this."
"Since it took fifteen years for the Netherlands to be reconstructed after five years of occupation, it is likely that a few generations will be needed before all the wounds of oppression, sustained over a 50-year period, are healed."
"May the Hungarian people display the courage and strength to conquer the past together and to collectively work on a future in peace and freedom."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the anticommunist uprising draw our attention to the crisis experienced by Ferenc Gyurcsány's socialist government."
"The new Hungarian elite has reclaimed the 1956 revolution and the communist symbols in order to justify liberalism."
"This strategy aims to give legitimacy to the current government, given its affiliation with the communist intelligentsia, and to reassure a population that, socially, is beginning to seriously suffer under the effects of liberalism."
"Communism in fact amounts to an excuse on would-be social grounds to exploit the people, as demonstrated today by China."
"Hungary has its place in the European Union because, in its experience of resisting totalitarianism, it brings new political sensibilities and, as in 1956, a popular ability to generate hope."
"Today, the protests by the extreme right against Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány, who has admitted having lied about the state of the economy in order to win the elections last April, have seen 100 000 people demonstrating in Budapest on the occasion of the 50th anniversary."
"Demonstrators clashed with police for hours in the streets, leading to arrests and injuries."
"Supporters of the leading right-wing opposition party are themselves claiming the role of the true heirs of 1956."
"In my opinion, it is not a case of rewriting the history that everyone knows, or that European socialists and communists fail to recognise."
"It is all too easy to appeal to the emotions, evoking the bodies of men, women and children who fell under the blows of the Soviet Union in the name of communism."
"The Italian communists, Hungary and the Communist Party leaders sided with the USSR against the Hungarian revolutionaries."
"Party Secretary Palmiro Togliatti and his successor Luigi Longo declared their solidarity with the re-establishment of internationalist justice many times, even years later."
"The current President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, appeared in the newspaper L'Unità condemning the revolutionaries as thugs and disreputable troublemakers."
"Fifty years later, in his autobiography, he does not retract this statement, but merely explains what is known to everyone, that is that in those years the Italian Communist Party and all European socialism was inseparable from the fortunes of the socialist block, led by the USSR."
"We should not so much condemn the Soviet Union's imperial actions, but rather strongly condemn those who, at the time, enthusiastically chose to support the invasion, in the name of communist and socialist internationalism."
"That concludes this item."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"(EL) The debate in the European Parliament and the resolutions tabled for 50th anniversary of the Hungary uprising are yet another organised attempt to rewrite history and fuel anti-communism."
"The celebrations by the representatives of capitalism and the presence of the secretary-general of ΝΑΤΟ, the President of the Commission and other imperialist leaders at the event in Budapest are the best testimony of the objectives of the Hungarian uprising, the overturning of the socialist system and the restoration of capitalism."
"The publication, moreover, of official documents which prove the active involvement of imperialists and organised support for the revolutionary forces are the best response to those who distort the nature of the events by calling it a popular uprising."
"The common, copycat shouts of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance about democracy and freedom are an attempt to sanctify capitalist barbarity and present it as the only way forward for the peoples."
"At the same time, they are hiding their fear of socialism, which is a social necessity."
"The forces of the left are taking on huge political responsibilities with their stand."
"Even though they know about the undermining and aggressive role of imperialism in the former socialist countries and their murderous role in all the grassroots movements, they are adopting the imperialist propaganda in the name of 'objectivity'."
"They are not taking a class-orientated approach to the events, thereby giving imperialism an alibi."
"(IT) I speak, with great pride, on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, a small group of uncompromising Italian socialists who have always chosen the same path and have refused offers from those on both the right and the left inviting us to give up."
"This red thread of independence, which runs through to the present day, had its crucial moment in 1956. At that time, the Italian Socialist Party, under Pietro Nenni, firmly condemned the violent attack by the communists that drowned the hopes of the Hungarian people in blood and massacred the insurgents."
"This was the national uprising of a proud people, who were fighting not only against the physical and moral sufferings inflicted by communism, but also against the political and cultural drabness that had stifled the traditions, identity and patriotism of the Hungarian people."
"As the tragedies of the following years demonstrated, to speak of communism and freedom has always represented a patent oxymoron."
"The members of the New Italian Socialist Party will never tire of repeating this truth, which was for too long denied in Italy by the Italian Communist Party."
"We therefore honour the 5 000 Hungarian martyrs who did not bow to injustice and who fought to the death to exert their right to a better future, to a prospect of freedom, democracy and peace."
"Breast cancer (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question to the Commission on the reintegration of breast cancer patients into the job market and use of social funds for continued training of health professionals in the field of breast cancer, by Mr Andersson and Mrs Jöns on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - B6-0433/2006),"
"the oral question to the Commission on the early detection and treatment of breast cancer in the enlarged European Union by Mr Florenz and Mrs Jöns on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0434/2006) and"
"the oral question to the Commission on breast cancer by Mrs Záborská and Mrs Jöns on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B6-0436/2006)."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the chairmen of the three committees, Mrs Záborská, Mr Florenz and Mr Andersson, most warmly for their fantastic cooperation in preparing this debate."
"I would also like to thank you, Madam President."
"Breast cancer was on the agenda three years ago, and it is now time to take an initial look at the results, which appears to be urgently necessary."
"In the 25 Member States, 275 000 women contract breast cancer every year."
"The risk of dying from it is twice as high in one Member State as in another."
"To make it worse, younger and younger women are contracting the disease: just in the last few years, the number of women under 40 affected has doubled."
"Breast cancer is still the number one cause of death in women between 35 and 55."
"However, I am also shocked at how radical treatment still is in many Member States."
"In some countries, mastectomies are still the rule rather than the exception, even in the very early stages of the disease, even though in 80% of cases these days it is possible to operate without removing the breast."
"As you can see, then, we are progressing at a snail's pace."
"This is particularly true in the new Member States, where the missed opportunities and deficiencies throughout the chain of care are at their worst."
"However, at least in the old Member States, the fact that the structures remain, as before, inadequate to catastrophic has less to do with public budget problems than with the economic and class interests of the doctors."
"Let us begin with early detection: the development of an across-the-board breast screening programme according to EU guidelines will involve a one-off cost for the public purse of no more than EUR 1.25 per citizen."
"I am therefore sure that nobody in this House wants to claim that this money is not available."
"If we had an EU-wide breast screening programme, we could save the lives of 31 000 women in the EU a year, help to reduce healthcare costs and substantially reduce subsequent costs for the whole of society."
"To date, though, only 11 countries have a quality-assured screening programme, and these programmes are a long way from being continuous."
"In your country, too, Mr Špidla, you must put a stop to the practice of passing off opportunistic screening as EU screening."
"In Cyprus, too, Mr Kyprianou, progress is still very sluggish."
"Now we know, of course, that you are both on our side, but it would nonetheless have been nice to have the Commission's progress report now, instead of in the Spring, which is when it is expected."
"We also call on you to put greater emphasis on the option of using money from the Structural Funds to develop a screening programme."
"However, even the best early detection system is of no use if subsequent treatment is inadequate or inappropriate."
"Time and again, breast cancer is operated on and treated in hospitals with barely any experience."
"I would therefore specifically like to thank the Commission for the EU guidelines for breast centres, which we have received from you since last year."
"The ball is now in the Member States' court, though, because the only place in the whole of the EU with such centres at the moment is - amazingly - the United Kingdom."
"That is why we will also call today, in our joint resolution, for the Member States to establish sufficient breast centres nationwide by 2016."
"This is absolutely feasible by 2016."
"We would need around 1 800 such centres EU-wide."
"Then all women would have the opportunity to get the same optimum treatment, regardless of where they live."
"In order to ensure that these breast centres actually work in accordance with the EU criteria, that they really do perform a minimum number of operations on primary breast cancer, namely 150 a year in a single centre, that the specialists really have specialised exclusively in benign and malignant breast diseases and that they really do carry out interdisciplinary consultations before and after the operation for each case of breast cancer, we now also need guidelines for the certification of breast centres."
"In this connection, we would call on you in the Commission to embark on drafting these guidelines with real speed."
"We would also ask you to draw up guidelines for the job description of breast nurses, who have a very important role to play in these centres, as guides and mediators between doctors and patients throughout the treatment process."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mrs Jöns."
"That is a very personal thank you."
"author. - (SV) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Jöns for her great commitment and for having got to grips with this tremendously important issue."
"As Mrs Jöns has already said, this is the most common form of cancer among women."
"It is also the most common cause of death among women aged between 35 and 59."
"What is more, we know that breast cancer is on the increase among younger women and that the chances of detecting the disease vary a very great deal from one EU Member State to another, as do opportunities for breast-screening."
"I know from my own country, Sweden, where breast-screening has been available for many years to women in certain age groups, that such screening has reduced the death rate amongst women and that it is important to detect the disease early in order to provide the right treatment."
"All of this means that the efforts mentioned in the resolutions discussed by Mrs Jöns are incredibly important."
"Three committees are involved in this work."
"We in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs do not have responsibility specifically for health and healthcare matters, but rather for the link to the labour market."
"We now have, I am happy to say, a labour market that is designed to involve women and where women can be found in ever increasing numbers."
"In my own country, the proportion of women in work is just as high as that of men."
"If someone contracts a serious illness such as breast cancer, one purely factual consideration is that time out has to be taken for treatment."
"It is sometimes possible for a woman to go on working, but to do so means also being able to discuss with her employer what changes might be made to her work patterns so that she might continue in employment while she is receiving treatment."
"It is also possible for someone to become seriously ill for a period of time but then get better as a result of treatment and be able to go back to work."
"The question is then one of how she can be successfully re-integrated into working life, and in such a way that the breast cancer treatment does not have a harmful effect on it"
"It is important for us to address these issues. That is the first point to be made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Our second area of concern comprises the professionals involved in these issues."
"There is constant progress in terms of research and development and procedures for treating breast cancer."
"It is important for medical staff to be kept up-to-date at all times on new procedures as they are developed."
"We do also have instruments at European level - specifically, within the framework of the Social Fund - with which to help staff develop their skills."
"In this area too, we must be able to make use of the Social Fund for the purposes of skills development, so that staff can use the best methods."
"This is also something to which the Lisbon Process is relevant."
"The Lisbon Process is, of course, about best practice, and that means that we are supposed to look to those countries that have made most progress."
"Finally, I would like to mention something else that I have spoken to Mrs Jöns about."
"Breast cancer is a disease that strikes women, but it is important that we men get involved in working towards better procedures."
"It must not be women alone who are committed to better methods of fighting diseases that affect women. It is, rather, something to which all of us - both men and women - must be committed."
"(Applause)"
"author. - (DE) Madam President, I am grateful to you, Mrs Jöns, for allowing me to co-author this question with you."
"I was delighted to do so, because I was struck during the debate by just how little I had heard on this topic up until now."
"As I followed the debate, I thought about how faint-hearted we really are in Europe, how stupidly we have acted in the past, and how many questions we have left open for this continent."
"I will try to add my political weight to the balance in this matter, because in terms of content I have nothing to add to what Mrs Jöns and others have said."
"I call on both Commissioners to summon up all their courage to deal with this topic, and to combat the faint-heartedness of the Council."
"The Council has often - and I have experienced this all too often - weakly said: that is subsidiarity, a national matter."
"Information and communication are the main tasks for the future, including with regard to this terrible disease, and I would therefore ask both Commissioners to exert all their political influence to convince the Council and to establish guidelines."
"Just think about it for a minute: we even have guidelines for drawing up guidelines, but we do not have any guidelines on how we should combat breast cancer, the most important disease on this continent, in the future."
"I think the idea of developing a job description for highly qualified nurses is an excellent and interesting one, and I pledge you my full support."
"(Applause)"
"author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again gathered in plenary to debate an issue which affects both public health and the lives of women and families in our constituencies: breast cancer."
"Already in 2003, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality had asked a question on this subject to the European Commission."
"Commissioner, at the time it was your predecessor, Mrs Diamantopoulou, who took the first steps to respond to Parliament's requests."
"Today, we ask you to recognise the progress that has been made."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is concerned with reducing mortality rates among women affected by breast cancer, improving their quality of life, and providing women and their associations, but also their close families, with information on the risks and treatment of breast cancer."
"In this debate, we should also take account of the role of men."
"Husbands, fathers and their children are also affected by these specifically women's diseases."
"I also remember the many parents whose daughters are affected by the disease and who provide them with support."
"Within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, we are working on the various aspects of the disease in order that one day we might see a Europe free from breast cancer."
"I am encouraged by the great interest that the committee has shown in this issue. I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent collaboration, which really deserves to be acknowledged."
"Breast cancer is a public health issue that is important for all women in the European Union."
"Every two minutes, someone is diagnosed with breast cancer."
"Every six minutes, a woman dies from it."
"This disease makes no distinction on grounds of race, religion or culture."
"We must have the honesty to recognise all the causes of breast cancer, without exception."
"It would be useful to compare the levels of increase across the Member States, in order to come to a conclusive strategy."
"All women ought to have easy access to the means of diagnosis and to quality treatment in the early stages, independently of their origin, social status or level of education."
"In this way, thousands of lives could be saved."
"This would be an example of truly positive discrimination."
"It is now crucial to make every woman aware of the risk of the disease, and to increase the resources allocated to breast cancer prevention and screening in the Member States."
"Commissioners, like me, you know from experience that the medical equipment is too expensive for regional hospitals in the new Member States."
"The medical industry is not prepared to make an effort in terms of finances; it is too concerned with making profits."
"All the same, I ask you to examine seriously the possibility of funding breast cancer prevention through the Structural Funds."
"The efforts of politicians, doctors and scientists in developing the network of cooperation in all the Member States could enable us to ensure equal access to the means of screening and health care."
"Only through this close collaboration can the fight against breast cancer transcend ideological divides and personal rivalries."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Parliament for having organised this debate on breast cancer."
"The very detail of the questions shows the wide range of issues involved."
"I will not try to address every question separately; that would be an impossible task, given my limited speaking time."
"However, I would be very happy to provide detailed information at a later stage."
"I shall therefore focus on three key areas, but first I should like to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem, already mentioned by many speakers."
"Every year, 270 000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the European Union."
"That affects their lives and the lives of their families and it has a very significant medical, social and economic cost."
"The first issue I should like to touch upon - and it has already been addressed - is how far we have come since the European Parliament's resolution of 5 June 2003."
"It is true that the resolution set out some ambitious targets for the Member States to reach by 2008, notably a 25% reduction in mortality and a reduction in differences between breast cancer survival rates in the Member States to 5%."
"I have to admit that it is too early to know exactly how much progress has been made."
"Member States have committed themselves to report to the Commission on the situation by the end of this year, three years after the adoption of the Council recommendations."
"The Commission will therefore produce an implementation report in 2007."
"I can assure you that the lack of information from some Member States will not delay production of the report."
"Instead, the report will indicate the Member States that have not provided the information."
"There are already signs that the resolution and other actions have had positive effects and started to make a difference."
"We expect progress on aspects such as the exchange of best practice models to facilitate application in different parts of the EU and the guidelines for screening diagnosis, delivering some very significant reductions in breast cancer mortality."
"In addition to providing the results on mortality, we hope to have the data to be able to set out a clear picture of the timeframes involved and developments as regards inequalities."
"The second general area I should like to touch upon is research."
"Breast cancer will feature strongly under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"This will cover both the detection of the disease and, crucially, the causes - in other words, how it can be prevented."
"As regards detection, research is focusing notably on improving breast cancer screening and alternatives to conventional mammography, in order to improve early detection."
"Examples already supported under the Sixth Framework Programme include mammography with molecular imaging or the application of positron emission tomography - PET - specifically designed for breast cancer examination."
"Early detection is, of course, crucial in ensuring successful treatment, but that is still treating the disease rather than the causes."
"I am therefore very pleased that work on the causes of cancer is a priority in the Research Framework Programme."
"That work will cover the three key areas of genetics, environment and lifestyle."
"Thirdly, the issue of campaigns: these can play a very important role in public health issues, in raising awareness of key issues by private individuals, public authorities and decision-makers, as well as, of course, health professionals."
"Not only does it enable individuals to help and protect themselves, it also puts pressure on the decision-makers to give priority to this problem, which they sometimes fail to do."
"The European Parliament's 2003 resolution has been an effective part of an ongoing campaign to increase awareness."
"Awareness-raising among women on the importance of screening has been a key part of European action against cancer."
"Such campaigns can be supported under our public health programme."
"In conclusion, we all agree that breast cancer has to be tackled and best practice examples show that significant results can be achieved."
"However, we have to understand that it is a continuous process."
"We must never become complacent, even if we are encouraged by the initial success of some of those efforts and initiatives."
"A coherent and collaborative approach is needed, covering in particular the three aspects I highlighted earlier."
"Of course, we have to admit that most of these actions are principally for the Member States, but the European Union can and will provide support - as in the case of research - where possible."
"As an indication, I can refer to future support for breast cancer screening guidelines, which will continue under the current and future health programmes, the European Council network and the European Union network for information on cancer in Europe."
"A new project that has now been shortlisted answers some of the questions relating to the extension of the guidelines."
"The European Union guidelines will be updated to cover not only the setting of standards for breast cancer nurses but also the specification for specialist breast units."
"They will set the standards, principles and benchmarks to which Member States will have to adjust their breast cancer screening, training and treatment."
"These initiatives will cover the need for information and consultation in the new Member States as well and will help to integrate the relevant experts within existing networks."
"We must never forget that each year more than a quarter of a million women depend on such action."
"They and their families depend on the priority we and the Member States will give to such an important and serious problem."
"We must not let them down."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all of those present in this Chamber are aware that breast cancer is a terrible ordeal for the sufferers."
"We are all aware of what an ordeal it is for their families and for those closest to them."
"This is a disease that can turn a person's life upside-down."
"The treatment is arduous and lengthy, and often stops sufferers from working or leading a normal life."
"My fellow Commissioner Mr Kyprianou spoke just now on issues of health and prevention in relation to breast cancer."
"In my short speech, I should like to focus on reintegrating breast cancer patients into working life."
"Breast cancer severely disrupts people's lives."
"Life changes direction and women are often ill-prepared for such a change, although in reality they often cope with the situation better than their relatives, friends, colleagues and employers."
"The latter often do not know how to behave towards women with breast cancer."
"There is no universal solution."
"Each individual situation needs to be treated on its own merits."
"There is little information or guidance available on how to deal with breast cancer sufferers from a legal, work, health or psychological point of view."
"The Community should improve the mechanisms for helping breast cancer patients."
"Experience has shown that it is better for women with breast cancer to carry on going to work, assuming, of course, that their physical and mental condition allows them to."
"In order to make life better for patients while they are unwell, special working hours and adapted holiday arrangements, for example in tandem with working from home, need to be introduced."
"This would also help them to reintegrate more easily and more quickly into the working environment."
"Support for employers and colleagues could play a crucial role during treatment."
"Psychological help should also be permanently available, and to this end, an educational awareness-raising campaign should be launched, aimed at employers and the workplace in general."
"As I said before, it is important to create the conditions whereby women with breast cancer can quickly and successfully be reintegrated into the labour market."
"The specially adapted working conditions that may be needed during treatment should perhaps be extended until some time after treatment, in order to help the patient to reintegrate."
"Breast cancer patients must not be allowed to suffer discrimination in the work place."
"The European Directive of November 2000 provides a general framework for equal treatment in employment and prohibits discrimination on the grounds of disability."
"The question remains whether long-term illness falls under the heading of disability."
"In the United Kingdom, for example, following lengthy discussions on this issue, the law prohibiting discrimination against the disabled has been updated and now provides for protection against discrimination against cancer sufferers."
"The European Court of Justice will need to decide whether this interpretation applies to the directive on prohibiting discrimination."
"EU legislation, specifically Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety of workers, also states that employers must adapt the nature of work to the worker's state of health, which implicitly includes those with chronic and long-term illnesses."
"I welcome the proposal to draw up a charter to protect those with chronic and long-term illnesses in the workplace."
"I feel, however, that the social partners should develop such a charter in conjunction with the relevant bodies at national level."
"Apart from legislative instruments, the Commission supports cooperation between the Member States via the open method of coordination in the area of social protection."
"Investment in health is one of the goals of the new structural funds for 2007-2013, in particular in the convergence regions."
"The objective is to increase the number of healthy working years and to enable as many people as possible to play an active role in society."
"This objective relates both to health infrastructure and to the training of health workers, an issue that has been mentioned in this Chamber."
"The measures in this area may include health support, disease prevention, knowledge sharing and the training of highly qualified workers."
"Honourable Members, the European social model is based on solidarity with the most vulnerable members of society, towards whom we have a moral responsibility."
"Breast cancer sufferers are physically and psychologically vulnerable and fragile, as well as actually having to fight against this disease."
"They need support, they need decent healthcare, they need protection against discrimination, they need to be reintegrated into working life under the best possible conditions."
"Honourable Members, I think that you can rely on us in this matter."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, we have heard a list of all the things we need, and what the House is saying is that we need action to achieve those things."
"This resolution offers one of those rare occasions where we have total unity round this Chamber: unity across committees, unity across political groups."
"It is unity on what is a rare disease."
"It is one of the rare diseases that is not the result of poverty; it is the result of increasing prosperity."
"That is why it is very much a European disease growing in prevalence."
"The most common cancer among women is breast cancer."
"We know the figures: 275 000 a year; 88 000 dying a year."
"That is why we demand access to better services, better research."
"But medical science is making hope possible: early diagnosis, new drugs, specialist nurses, new therapies and knowledge leading to prevention."
"All those things mean that we do not have to accept this terrible toll among women."
"But it is also an issue for men."
"One thousand men in the European Union die each year from breast cancer."
"Fill this Chamber with men - every seat filled, and the galleries and the interpreters' booths, and the platform - and wipe it out."
"That is the number of men we are losing each year to breast cancer."
"Men need specialist services too."
"They also have problems because although it is easier to spot in men, it is left too late and so the tumours are too large."
"So they need screening."
"Too many men cannot cope."
"They cannot cope, not just with the disease, but with going home to their families and telling them they have got breast cancer."
"They cannot cope with going down to the pub to tell their mates they have got breast cancer."
"Some - and 'some' is too many - kill themselves rather than face the consequences of their diagnosis."
"That is our fault."
"We do not enable them to cope; we must."
"For men and women, our message is that we have a united resolution and we demand united action from the Commission."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, my thanks go to Mrs Jöns for bringing this issue back before the House."
"This disease is not only a women's issue, as Mr Bowis and Mrs Záborská have said."
"Hundreds of thousands of men, hundreds of thousands of families, are affected by the disease each year."
"My mother-in-law died of breast cancer and my wife's eldest sister was diagnosed with breast cancer ten years ago, but thanks to early and successful treatment she is alive and well today."
"I am sure you can imagine the shadow this disease casts over me and my family."
"But, as we have heard, it is a particular ordeal for the 275 000 women who contract the disease each year and, tragically, the 88 000 women who die of the disease each year in the European Union, and their families."
"These are figures which can and must be radically reduced."
"We need further research into prevention."
"But it is particularly shocking to me that mortality rates vary by as much as 50% across the Member States and that mastectomy rates vary by up to 60%."
"That too is unacceptable."
"There is clearly a pressing need for best practice to be spread evenly across the Union into every region and that best practice needs to be built around the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis."
"Another pressing issue is the fact that an increasing number of younger women are developing breast cancer - 47% under 55 years of age."
"Add to that the fact that up to 20%, a fifth of former breast cancer patients, do not return to work and it becomes clear that something needs to be done if we are to meet the Lisbon target for women's participation in the labour market."
"I therefore fully commend the resolution's call - and I am pleased to hear Commissioner Špidla respond positively to it today - to draw up a charter for the protection of the rights of breast cancer patients and currently sick people in the workplace to facilitate their reintegration into the world of work."
"Their working hours need to be tailored to their treatment pattern and their reabsorption into the workplace needs to be built around their rehabilitation."
"Five women per day are diagnosed with breast cancer in my own region."
"I hope that, with proper research into prevention, that figure will be reduced."
"I also hope that our work can come to mean that those diagnoses will not represent a death sentence; rather a diagnosis needs to become a trigger for early, sensitive, humane intervention, successful treatment and re-entry into the world of work and a full and fulfilling life."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I should like to add my thanks to Mrs Jöns for this splendid initiative."
"She has done a tremendous amount of work on it."
"The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in European women, as we have heard, is one in ten, and it is the biggest killer of women between the ages of 35 to 59, and the second biggest overall."
"Mr Bowis was absolutely right: we must not forget that although it mainly affects women, one thousand men die of breast cancer each year."
"Still not enough is being done by Member States."
"With advanced screening techniques, it is possible for breast cancer to be identified at an early stage."
"The European Commission published a new set of guidelines on breast cancer screening and diagnosis in April."
"They estimated that 32 000 breast cancer deaths across Europe could be prevented."
"But many Member States do not have technical screening facilities or trained nurses in place."
"I urge every Member State to sign up to the European guidelines but, more importantly, to implement those guidelines."
"We need to do even more in terms of education."
"Lifestyle, as well as genetics, can apparently affect the likelihood of getting breast cancer."
"We also need to make sure that those diagnosed with breast cancer are not discriminated against in the workplace, as we have already heard."
"They should be allowed to continue to work during treatment, if that is what they wish to do; but, if not, to be able to resume their careers afterwards."
"That should be covered by the 2000 Employment Directive on anti-discrimination in the workplace - we have done that in the United Kingdom."
"But many Member States do not class breast cancer as a disability, which is why we need a definition of disability."
"With so many people developing breast cancer, we must get that right."
"We must also have an exchange of best practice, particularly as mortality rates vary by 50% between Member States."
"It is up to us all to keep this high on the political agenda."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we have before us an excellent motion for resolution, which talks a great deal about better prevention and treatment for breast cancer."
"As several of you have already pointed out, it submits proposals for, for example, better screening."
"Quite right too, and we should build on that."
"However, I would like to stress once again that it is also a matter of prevention."
"It is an old wives' tale that genetic factors and lifestyle are the only causes of this illness."
"New studies have confirmed that harmful environmental factors in the form of toxic chemicals or increased radiation are responsible for half of all cases of breast cancer."
"That is something to which we must pay attention."
"Alongside comprehensive research into the causes, health protection must be at the forefront of European chemicals legislation."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we initiated a move towards greater health and environmental protection in Europe."
"However, today's vote on breast cancer also provides clear support for a strong REACH, because it is clear that the changes in women's hormonal systems make them particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of chemicals."
"Studies from the USA show that female farmers who use certain pesticides on their fields are more prone to breast cancer."
"Women who live within a mile of a special waste site for herbicides and pesticides are also at greater risk, and we know that many of the softening agents previously used in cosmetics contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells."
"Prevention should have an even higher priority in our fight against breast cancer."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, I have listened to all the previous speakers and I too wish to take my turn in thanking the authors of the resolution and those who have worked so intensively to combat breast cancer."
"I shall comment, Commissioner, on the inequalities and on treatment."
"As you know, the mortality rate is higher in the ten new Member States and screening programmes are very 'kindergarten', to coin a phrase."
"I include my own country in this which, as you may know, has a pilot rather than a national programme."
"It is a pity, Commissioner, to leave the country where someone will fall ill with breast cancer and the country and hospital in which they will be treated to luck."
"This is due to the fact that the guidelines on the development, firstly, of quality mammograms and, secondly, of countries with specialist treatment centres - breast clinics - with specialist nurses, are not easy to consolidate."
"I shall not, of course, omit to refer here to what John Bowis also said earlier: that men also get breast cancer and that we should not always refer solely and exclusively to women."
"As we are debating breast cancer today through this fine initiative, I should like to point out that other forms of cancer, Commissioner, are not poor relations."
"There are other forms of cancer where, with precisely the same guidelines, we can reduce the repercussions and the mortality rate."
"What we need is a strategy for cancer as a whole, which coordinates all 25 Member States, and to stop sucking on the sweetie of subsidiarity, with the result that no money is granted from the Structural Funds in order to develop these programmes."
"I beg you to please examine these issues."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I wholeheartedly support this question to the Commission from each of the three committees on what I regard as a most important topic."
"I also want to welcome the positive response from the Commissioners."
"I co-signed this resolution on breast cancer as I believe the European Union can do much to assist Member States in this area through extensive research, benchmarking and sharing of best-practice principles, as well as offering Member States substantial professional, material and technical assistance through European programmes."
"The main concern that legislators and health teams face today with regard to breast cancer is that every woman, irrespective of her place of residence, social status, occupation and education, should have access to high-quality screening for treatment and aftercare in the event of cancer."
"We need to improve the service of information to women, both younger and older, about the risks of and availability of treatment for breast cancer in order to ultimately reduce the mortality rate of women and to improve their quality of life and assist them in returning to work if they so desire."
"There is a need for more extensive research on the causes of breast cancer, in particular on the effects of hazardous chemicals and the environmental pollution, nutrition, lifestyle and genetic factors."
"I call on the Commission, through the Seventh Framework Programme, to provide financial support for the further development of blood-based tests, to provide funding for comprehensive investigation into the causes of breast cancer, to urge Member States to set up information and counselling centres, whilst simultaneously reporting back to the European Parliament on the results of more recent research conducted in this very important area."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, the alarming statistics on women suffering and dying from breast cancer certainly call for a resolution calling on the Commission and the Member Sates to combat this epidemic and conduct breast screening."
"Importantly, they also point to the need to take preventive action, which should involve the elimination of risk factors."
"It would therefore be appropriate to draw logical conclusions from existing research."
"These results indicate that breast cancer is not simply due to toxic damage, but that its main cause is the use of hormonal contraceptives from an early age, along with hormone replacement therapy."
"In addition, breast cancer can be triggered by complications following abortion."
"Furthermore, breast cancer often occurs amongst childless women, or amongst women who become pregnant relatively late in life and who go through the menopause relatively late."
"The more children a woman bears, the smaller the chance she has of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer or cancer of the uterus."
"It follows that the increased incidence of cancer can also be linked to the feminist concept of womanhood, which aims to deprive women of motherhood, exploit them as a potential part of the workforce and practically force them to control their so-called reproductive life, which virtually amounts to perceiving them as animals."
"According to psycho-oncologists, the increased incidence of tumours is not unrelated to the spread of mental disorders, notably depression."
"These result in reduced immunity to disease and allow the development of tumours."
"Preventive measures should therefore involve spreading a culture of life as an alternative to the widespread notion that everything around us is about to collapse."
"(SK) I would like to inform you of the outcome of discussions held on 20 October 2006 at one of the largest and oldest women's organisations in Slovakia, the Union of Slovak Women."
"At the meeting the women were discussing the intolerable breast cancer situation in Slovakia and other European countries."
"Nowadays, cancer is curable if diagnosed early enough."
"Thus, given that the disease is preventable, women are dying partly because of our ignorance."
"Therefore, I am here to inform you of the 'Don't Let Us Die' initiative conceived on 20 October."
"I call on politicians, physicians, patients and the general public to prevent their mothers, wives, partners and daughters from dying of a disease that need not be fatal."
"The European Parliament enacts regulations on nature protection, European motorways are being built, but investment in health is overlooked."
"The European Union is also striving to reduce life-style differences between Member States."
"Indeed, we are doing well in many areas."
"However, statistics on cancer curability indicate that there are major differences between Member States, and these include breast cancer survival rates."
"Slovak women have a 30% lower chance of surviving this kind of cancer than many women from Western Europe."
"It is deplorable that we cannot effectively guarantee the screening needed to boost the survival rate."
"It is necessary to give women the opportunity to see their doctors for screening in the evening or at weekends, and at the same time to reward doctors and medical professionals properly for this additional work."
"I believe that the majority of women are aware of this problem and behave responsibly."
"They only need the appropriate access to a doctor."
"Prevention, however, is not free; it requires considerable funding."
"Therefore, everyone should be exerting more pressure to ensure that spending on prevention is not crowded out by other priorities."
"We should approve a budget that provides for investing in prevention, which means not only fitting out hospitals and purchasing mammographs or sonographs, but above all investing in human resources so that a sufficient number of health professionals are available to operate this equipment."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to something that has already been said."
"Firstly, I believe that the European Commission's policy is a good one, trying to harmonise aspects in a field in which it does not have any real competences, but where it can exercise leadership, and in this regard we insist that it extend its policies and carry on emphasising self-examination and pointing out the differences amongst the various countries. I am not saying that it should condemn them, but I do say that it should highlight any shortcomings."
"Above all, I also believe that its website should be expanded and self-examination should be introduced, for example, and a series of other possible actions taken, as is already happening in some commercial organisations."
"Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the family tragedy that normally accompanies cases of breast cancer."
"I believe that families are very frequently broken up and that many women do not dare to report their case precisely because the cancer interrupts their work rhythm, disrupts their normal lives and would prevent them from looking after their families in the event of their having to undergo surgery."
"I therefore believe that the European Union must broaden its action and deal also with this area of family assistance and of awareness-raising."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, breast cancer is a major health problem, and increasingly so."
"It is second only to lung cancer as the most prevalent type of cancer, but the causes of lung cancer are partly known."
"Smoking and asbestos are significant among them and air pollution is a risk factor."
"Something can be done in order to prevent lung cancer; as people can, for example, stop smoking."
"Little is known, in fact, about breast cancer, though, other than the statistics."
"The incidence of breast cancer in the Netherlands is higher than anywhere else."
"There are also statistical connections, and I would thank the Commissioner for the extensive and detailed response to my written question."
"The Commissioner claims that there is a connection between obesity and breast cancer; there is also one with having children late in life."
"There is a socio-economic factor: low-income groups do not get screened as often and are therefore more likely to die of the disease."
"Finally, according to the Commission, perhaps the most important factor determining the risk of breast cancer is hormones, particularly oestrogens."
"These can be oestrogens from various sources, including chemical pollution, or exposure to environmental factors, but also the use of medicines or contraceptives."
"Commissioner, this is important information."
"In all contacts I have with women's groups, there are two factors that keep cropping up."
"Many breast cancer patients suspect that their illness is related to the environment, medicines or the use of the pill."
"Could you therefore give the necessary incentives so that research in this area is given the necessary priority?"
"More clarity is needed about the effects of hormone-regulating substances in the environment and the use of hormones such as medicines and contraceptives."
"I am particularly indebted to Mrs Jöns for her unstinting concern for, and commitment to, women with breast cancer."
"Her work is a true inspiration to many women."
"I should also like to express my appreciation for Europa Donna, which I should like to thank for the excellent work they are doing in making it possible for European countries to learn from each other, which is exactly what we should be doing."
"(FI) Madam President, the number of cancer cases will grow dramatically in the years to come as the European population ages."
"Many are worried about the adequacy of resources for treatment and growing costs."
"This has to do with economic growth, and also the increase in patients' own costs."
"Guaranteeing our citizens equal opportunities to receive treatment in healthcare and nursing is an important policy issue both within the Member States and at EU level."
"We must ensure that age does not mean that people are less entitled to services and good care."
"Next I would like to say a few words about the integration of patients into the world of work."
"I understand that it is important for growth to get people back to work."
"This is often important for patients as well."
"We patients are quite normal people on the whole."
"Nevertheless, we also have to remember to be humane when integrating people back into work."
"From the point of view of humanity, it is important that everyone has sufficient time to recover from their illness."
"We have to remember that recovery time differs from one person to another."
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for some excellent work."
"I want to protest against Commissioner Špidla's statement that breast cancer stops people from living a normal life."
"It does not actually need to be that way."
"I myself am an example of someone with breast cancer which, if discovered in time, operated on and treated properly, does not in any way prevent someone from leading a normal life and working."
"Finland is one of the European countries in which breast cancer is becoming common fastest, but thanks to screening and treatment, the mortality rate has not gone up for decades."
"Improved screening and treatment alone are not enough, however: we also need to examine the causes of cancer."
"My colleagues, Mr Breyer and Mrs Corbey, mentioned that new research suggests that as many as half of new cases of breast cancer may be explained by environmental factors, one of which is industrial chemicals, which we are exposed to all the time."
"A cocktail of chemicals that damage hormones is particularly dangerous, especially for the foetus and during puberty."
"We need to do something about this."
"(PT) Madam President, as we know, breast cancer is not only the most common cancer in women, it is also the biggest killer of women between the ages of 35 and 59."
"Accordingly, the policy of information on breast screening must be improved and stepped up, programmes to detect cancer at an early stage must be put in place and support for research into preventing breast cancer must be strengthened."
"Hence the importance of the issues that we put to the Commission. We are also hopeful of a positive response from the Member States so as to ensure that all women, regardless of their social and economic status, have access to the prevention, screening, early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, and can be reintegrated into the labour market without suffering discrimination."
"(FR) Madam President, in France, in practical terms, breast cancer means first of all, at the screening stage, a mammogram, followed by anatomical pathology confirming the presence of cancer."
"This assessment should be extended to include the liver, the brain and the bones, which are the three areas targeted by metastases."
"At best, in France, a bone scintigram will be taken; MRI and above all PET scans, used for early metabolic diagnosis, are not performed."
"During treatment, if patients receive radiotherapy, it will be carried out by a low-ranking technician."
"As a result, accidental irradiation sometimes occurs around the heart and the thyroid."
"Finally, after treatment, if, when a patient suffering back pain is examined, a scintigram is taken showing a suspicious shadow on the bone, screening by PET scan will still not be performed."
"Why?"
"Because in France, for 35 million women, there are only two PET scanners."
"Why?"
"Because the budgetary austerity pact forbids spending on hospital equipment."
"As a result, women are dying in Europe due to breast cancer, but also due to the ideological cancer of the European Commission known as budgetary Malthusianism and rampant free-marketism."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, breast cancer kills too many women in the European Union, many of them far too young."
"These deaths are unacceptable given that we know that early detection can cure this cancer."
"We are all aware of the mental and physical trauma suffered by women diagnosed with this illness: they have to reorganise their family and working life and, quite simply, deal with it."
"However, there is absolutely no harmonisation at European level with regard to the way in which we combat the scourge of breast cancer."
"Only ten Member States run screening programmes, with varying degrees of success."
"European women are therefore faced with a blatantly unfair situation, simply because of which country, or even which town, they live in."
"Commissioner, our aim is to eradicate this disease, in the knowledge that, quite apart from the traumatic experience for the patient, it has a cost for our society."
"The solution to this blight is early, compulsory screening, organised by the governments of the Member States."
"In order to be effective, this screening must be free, and above all must be well run, which requires the availability of up-to-date equipment throughout the European Union."
"Digital mammography, which in the past sometimes missed microcalcifications - the most common signs of breast cancer - has made considerable progress, so, Commissioner, when are we going to have digital mammograms throughout the European Union?"
"Effective screening also requires all the equipment to be subject to calibration and therefore to quality controls, because there is nothing worse than giving women a false sense of security through a radiological examination that could be of poor quality."
"For this screening to be effective, equipment on its own is not enough: the doctors who perform these diagnostic tests must undertake continuing training, as well as regular refresher courses and compulsory testing to evaluate their skills."
"Finally, women need information regarding the prevention of breast cancer: they need advice on healthy living and food safety, and must not be afraid of screening."
"Research must enable us to make progress in finding the causes of breast cancer."
"I am convinced that, if we combine our efforts, we will once again be able to show what the European Union can do to improve the health of European women."
"That is certainly a subject that should have unanimous support in the European Union: zero deaths from breast cancer in Europe!"
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioners, I should like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their hard work and for the clarity of their comments."
"The problem we are discussing today is a serious one: one only needs to look at the alarming statistics on the occurrence of breast cancer in Europe and to see the number of deaths caused by this disease to be convinced of that."
"This problem is made all the more serious by the fact that there are major inequalities between countries with regard to both the prevention and the treatment of cancer, and these inequalities have become even more pronounced since the last enlargement."
"Although the Treaties state that, in conjunction with the Member States, the European Union shall work to protect and promote the health of European citizens, we nevertheless need to give greater emphasis to the phrase 'in conjunction', because the EU's guidelines and recommendations have not been taken sufficiently into account."
"We now need to respond to this state of affairs, and not continue to tolerate it."
"The European Union must ensure that its citizens have equal access to the detection and management of the disease, and to the best available treatments."
"We can do this by legislative and budgetary means, as well as through the Structural Funds and research programmes."
"We must channel all the resources necessary to research all the causes of this disease, be they environmental, social or genetic, and to undertake research into innovative treatments."
"The Commission needs to present us with some proposals in this regard, and I really do think that the European Union should make the fight against breast cancer, and against cancer in general, a political priority, because together we will always be stronger."
"This is the added value of the European Union that the people of Europe expect."
"Studies, diagnostics, evaluations and resolutions are all necessary, but action is absolutely vital."
"The Commission and the Council should therefore heed our warning cry and lose no more time."
"Madam President, today we are debating an excellent resolution which has implications for all women and indeed for all families in the EU."
"As already stated, every six minutes a woman in the EU dies from cancer."
"That is a truly shocking statistic and one which should spur us on to immediate action."
"Breast screening, which according to the WHO can reduce deaths from breast cancer by up to 35%, is offered on a nationwide basis in only 11 Member States."
"Shame on all of us!"
"And shame on my own country, Ireland, where we have not yet rolled out breast-check nationwide."
"Deaths from breast cancer in the Republic of Ireland are significantly higher than in the north of Ireland, where they have already established breast screening."
"But we, like many other European countries, do not yet have nationwide cover."
"Finally, two crucial points: every country should have nationwide breast cancer care supported by interdisciplinary breast units at appropriate locations; and women over 69 or, in Ireland's case, 65, must not be excluded from breast screening."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the competent parliamentary committees for their initiative in instigating this joint debate on breast cancer, given that it is a given and constantly increasing risk to women's and men's health, at younger and younger ages."
"The repercussions which it has on the organisation of personal, family, social and productive life have already been pointed out."
"A call is therefore being made today for the Community strategy to respond to both present circumstances and emerging trends and challenges for the health of our citizens and to use all possible means to achieve the objectives of a perceptible reduction which it has set."
"Breast cancer is an illness in which proper screening plays a fundamental role, as we know from the statistics at our disposal and as we have heard today during the debate."
"However, this means that we need a modern infrastructure in terms of materials and equipment and specialised staff."
"The 'Europe against Cancer' programme, in conjunction with all the other facilities offered by the Structural Funds, research programmes and so forth, must respond to these challenges."
"Proper medical and psychological monitoring of patients is also very important, as we have already heard."
"The Member States, therefore, together with the regional and local authorities, are obliged to safeguard these conditions of prevention, monitoring and therapy for all citizens in every corner of their region."
"This is particularly important for the new Member States, especially as we are about to welcome another two new members to 'our family'."
"I should like to emphasise here the role which civil society plays in informing and supporting patients."
"Many interesting initiatives have been developed in various countries and have even been networked at European level."
"We need to support their work, especially in the new Member States, and to provide the opportunity for exchanges of best practices and added value for the benefit of the health of our citizens."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations and thanks to Mrs Jöns, who is not only the main initiator of today's motion for resolution and of the question, but also works tirelessly to raise awareness of the issue of breast cancer."
"That of course means that there will be huge support for this motion for resolution tomorrow."
"Breast cancer is the number one cause of death amongst women aged between 35 and 59, amongst both mothers and women without children."
"Every year, 88 000 women and 1 000 men in the European Union die of breast cancer."
"Breast screening can considerably reduce mortality from breast cancer amongst women aged between 50 and 69."
"There have been EU guidelines on this subject since 1992, but so far they have been implemented in only 11 Member States, and there are huge differences in women's mortality rates."
"That is why we are eagerly awaiting the progress report that Commissioner Kyprianou announced for 2007."
"However, today the European Parliament is not just discussing the early detection of breast cancer and the best way to treat it, but also prevention."
"The causes of breast cancer need to be investigated in more detail, in particular the role of toxic chemicals, environmental pollution, diet, lifestyle and genetic factors, and also the question of how these factors interact."
"In a few weeks, when Parliament votes on the new European chemicals policy, we will have an opportunity to send a clear signal that we take the prevention of cancer seriously."
". - (DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today we have been hearing the overwhelming figures that bear witness to the effect that breast cancer has on the lives of both men and women."
"It is a matter of pure chance whether treatment is started quickly and efficiently and therefore how high the woman's chances of survival are."
"As the coordinator of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I have been working on this topic for many years, and we have gained a great deal of experience."
"We cannot leave it at that, though."
"We have had the EU guidelines for quality mammography for over ten years now."
"In Belgium, where I have my second home, I am invited for routine screening, while in my homeland of Germany nothing is happening."
"The lives of mothers, daughters and wives could be saved, and the trauma reduced."
"However, we are still only progressing at a snail's pace."
"The Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality presented an excellent report in 2003, but very little has happened since."
"I think there is a lack of political will in this matter: I can tell that the will is there at European level, but in the Member States much still remains to be done."
"The Seventh Research Framework Programme now once again gives us the opportunity to exert pressure so that more money goes into research."
"In the case of other women's diseases, such as migraines, too, there has been little political pressure applied to move forward and take interdisciplinary action."
"As over 20 years of experience in the United States have shown, interdisciplinary breast centres can provide very efficient assistance."
"We now also have such centres in Europe, but here, too, I do not see any sign of the political will to really implement that."
"Let us therefore work together, here in the European Parliament, to fight against the trauma of breast cancer, and do so for everyone, not just those who can afford it."
"(PT) In spite of the progress that has been made in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer is still the main cause of death among women of between 35 and 55."
"It is estimated that in Europe alone breast cancer kills more than 130 000 women per year."
"Every two and a half minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer."
"All women must have access to information, prevention and appropriate treatment."
"Screening programmes, using mammography, should be mandatory in all Member States."
"More information campaigns on how to lead a healthy lifestyle are needed."
"The prevention and treatment of breast cancer should also be among the priorities of the Seventh Research Framework Programme, especially at a time when studies show that, as well as genetic factors, environmental and lifestyle factors can also play a part in the development of breast cancer."
"(DA) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, breast cancer is the most frequent cause of death of women aged between 35 and 50, and the number of women who survive the disease varies greatly from country to country."
"We must call on the Member States to set up centres to provide information and advice on hereditary breast cancer, and we must call on the Commission to present a progress report on the matter every other year."
"It is important for priority to be given to breast cancer research."
"The EU's Seventh Framework Research Programme should, therefore, also appropriate resources for research into breast cancer: not only into its physiological and technical aspects and into alternatives to conventional forms of treatment, but also into its social consequences and, especially, into its causes."
"We need to be able to learn from each other, and this is of course precisely the kind of cooperation for which the EU also offers a constructive framework."
"The EU should head European campaigns to prevent the disease and to inform women as to how they can examine their breasts. Moreover, the individual governments should introduce national breast-screening programmes in all the Member States, because early detection of breast cancer can significantly reduce mortality rates."
"(PL) Madam President, the statistics on cancer in the European Union are alarming."
"Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer after lung cancer."
"In the European Union, a new case is diagnosed ever two minutes and a woman dies of breast cancer every six minutes."
"The best way of combating breast cancer is through regular screening and promoting effective diagnosis of the tumour."
"The widespread use of mammography could reduce the number of deaths by as much as 35%, providing, of course, that the tests are carried out regularly and are readily accessible to all."
"European Union provisions laying down standards in this area have been binding for 15 years."
"Nonetheless, about half of the countries in the Union are not implementing regular screening programmes."
"This must change."
"As the European Parliament, we expect a clear response concerning the actions the European Commission intends to undertake to help Member States reach their targets."
"One of these is a 25% reduction in the average mortality rate by 2008."
"A coordinated strategy at Union level is essential in order to combat breast cancer."
"Now is the time for specific action."
"Over 100 000 women a year are dying of breast cancer."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has brought forward the themes of prevention, the quality of health intervention, the urgency of research, and the right to dignity and to work."
"These themes form an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Parliament's political objective is therefore to indicate the urgency of coordinated action, something that the Commission must carry out by assuming a stronger and more visible leading role in relation to the Member States."
"It is not enough to set targets for 2008: we need to monitor them, take corrective action and understand what progress is being made."
"There are no prizes for model countries in this field, nor are there penalties for those which do not make progress."
"I therefore propose to the Commissioners that they introduce a kind of blacklist for nations that do not make any progress, as we have already done for airlines that do not guarantee safety."
"Let us use the strength of public opinion, united with the scientific community, to support Community policies."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that was a very important debate, and a very good one, for we have shown once more that this House really does stand alongside women suffering from breast cancer, and their families too."
"We are, by the way, as far as I am aware, the only legislature in the European Union to mark the international month of breast cancer by debating structural improvements in the treatment and early diagnosis of breast cancer."
"Today, while I would like to extend thanks to the Commission for having given us an undertaking that it will devise a certification procedure for interdisciplinary breast centres and for specialist nurses in the field, I have to tell the Commissioners that we really would be pleased if they were to put these guidelines on the web, which would not be an over-hasty thing to do in this era of modern communication, and that we have not given up the hope of their putting the existing guidelines on sale in something other than book form alone."
"This debate, though, has, for the first time, put the spotlight on a completely new angle, that being the question of how to deal with women with breast cancer in the work environment and their reintegration into the labour market, and calls have been made for a campaign to make employers aware of these issues."
"Commissioner Špidla has today - if I understand him rightly - promised us one, and many thanks to him for that."
"This highlights how important it is that there should be a charter of rights for people with chronic illnesses at work, and I think that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be concerning itself with that issue."
"Let me close by observing that the answer, to those who have no idea how to deal with breast cancer patients, is that they should be treated in exactly the same way as those suffering from other cancers; they should not be stigmatised - which is, unfortunately, something that still happens - but should, quite simply, be treated entirely normally, which will probably do them the most good."
"Thank you, Mrs Jöns."
"Although I am meant only to be chairing this debate, I shall do what I am not supposed to do and endorse your call for the guidelines to be put on the Web."
"The Commission does not need to use the book as a means of recovering its costs."
"Member of the Commission."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Members for a very interesting and helpful debate."
"I knew from the beginning that we were on the same side, but it is good to reassure each other whenever possible."
"I should like to respond to a few specific points very briefly and then make one general comment, which will cover the issue raised."
"We are aware of the issue of breast cancer in men, raised by Mr Bowis."
"We have to deal with it as a rare disease, because it is much less common than for women."
"We are focusing on it and will raise it with experts very soon to see how we can include it in future guidelines, but as a rare disease, in the same way as we deal with other rare diseases."
"On research, I should like to repeat that environmental causes are part of the plan."
"The new Seventh Framework Programme will provide an opportunity to open up that area of research."
"Gene-environment interaction and cancer development will also cover lifestyle and other major risk factors."
"We will then be able to learn more about the causes of the disease."
"That is a priority, because prevention is much more important than having to treat the disease afterwards."
"The question of other cancers was raised by Mr Adamou."
"We are working on those and not just concentrating on one."
"Each one is a specific case and needs specific guidelines and a specific approach."
"We expect to have guidelines for cervical cancer by next year, for prostate cancer by 2008 and for colorectal cancer by 2009."
"We have to evaluate, we have to have research, we have to put everything together and then come up with guidelines."
"We are also working on other areas such as the hepatitis B and C viruses, because we know they cause liver cancer, as well as aspects such as tobacco, obesity and other causes of cancer."
"We have issued guidelines and recommendations on how Member States deal with this and the inequalities."
"These do not have legal force, so we cannot enforce them on Member States."
"They represent best practice."
"With your help, we encourage and put pressure on Member States to comply with the guidelines."
"I look forward to debating this once we have produced the report."
"We shall then be able to discuss the outcome and the commitment of the Member States."
"This is a worrying issue."
"The numbers are terrifying."
"If we have to put pressure on Member States to do their job on this, you can imagine what happens with rare diseases which do not affect so many people."
"Putting it cynically and bluntly, there is not so much political pressure."
"If we stop to think about it we could panic, but we must not."
"Our job is to make sure that Member States fulfil their commitments and follow the recommendations they adopt and the guidelines they agree to."
"We shall be working on that, in relation not just to breast cancer but to all the inequalities that unfortunately still exist in the European Union, within Member States as well as between Member States."
"This is not the European Union of solidarity that we all aspire to and have all joined."
"That applies to the use of structural funds."
"The money is there, but unless spending on health is adopted as a priority by Member States, there is nothing we can do."
"Again, it is a challenge for us to make Member States adopt the policies."
"Unless Member States acknowledge that spending on health is not a cost but an investment - and we have to convince them of that - the situation will not improve."
"That is where we have to work together and cooperate."
"Member of the Commission. (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I should like to thank you for the debate, which has been extremely fruitful, and has clarified the issue of breast cancer from a range of perspectives."
"I welcome the fact that other issues have come to the fore in the debate, including social issues, showing that the circumstances of this disease extend beyond exclusively medical factors, and touch also on the fight against discrimination in the work place and in society as a whole."
"It is also clear that the direct opportunities open to the EU are limited, although we are not making the most of the opportunities that we do have, and in my opinion this is one of the biggest challenges that we face."
"I should like to thank Parliament in general, because I firmly believe that if we manage to maintain the same level of determination and political will to resolve this issue, we really can resolve it, directly or indirectly."
"Given that social and medical policy is always measured in units, and that those units are individual human beings, any progress, however great or small, can ultimately be converted into human lives, and I am convinced that we can achieve such progress and that the outcome of this will be clear."
"A motion for a resolution to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Culture and Education on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector (MEDIA 2007) (06233/2/2006 - C6-0271/2006 - 2004/0151 (COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Hieronymi)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, today finds us debating MEDIA 2007, the third generation support programme for the European film industry."
"I want to extend the warmest thanks to the members of the Committee on Culture and Education and to the advisory committees for their excellent cooperation, and particularly too to Commissioner Reding and her staff, who, together with this House, have tried to do everything they could to help the European audio-visual industry develop further and be a success."
"It was exactly a year ago today, on 25 October 2005, that we in this House adopted this draft programme by a broad majority."
"We had wanted to adopt the programme in good time - and by that I mean early - so that it could be available to Europe's film-makers with effect from 1 January 2007, but the European Council was not, alas, far-sighted enough to stick to this timetable, and required us, in the first instance, to go through some difficult financial negotiations."
"The MEDIA 2007 programme is structured in the same way as its successful predecessors, MEDIA and MEDIA PLUS, covering training, development and sales in the audiovisual sector, but not production, which is a matter for the Member States to deal with."
"What makes the MEDIA programme so extraordinarily important is the fact that the audio-visual sector is, as we are all aware, one of the fastest growing economic sectors not only in Europe, but throughout the world."
"If Europe wants to keep up, it has to get on the right track."
"The MEDIA programme represents a response to two core problems with the European audio-visual market, the first of which is its fragmentation, which is attributable primarily to our cultural, linguistic and national diversity; while that is a treasure, and one of the most important treasures Europe possesses, it also presents great challenges in terms of market development."
"Secondly, the audio-visual market in Europe suffers from chronic under-capitalisation."
"The MEDIA programme does a good job of responding to those challenges."
"The MEDIA programme helped fund 90% of all films produced for export within Europe, and every euro invested through it brings another twenty in follow-up investment, and so it was very definitely right that the Commission, and Commissioner Reding in particular, should push as they did for adequate funding for this on the part of the European Union, and proposed that this should amount to the sum of one billion euros."
"It is unfortunate that the Council could not, in the course of negotiations, be prevailed upon to accept this sum, which was reduced to EUR 671 million, so we have managed to maintain the status quo without achieving any further development."
"The new programme does, nevertheless, incorporate three priorities."
"The first is digitisation, the second enhanced cooperation at every level, and the third improved access to financial institutions specialising in the funding of films."
"All I can say to all that is that we are speaking out strongly in favour of a quick start for the programme, of its successful implementation and of what we hope will be adequate funding next time round."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that, like me, everyone in Parliament values the MEDIA programme, a programme that has proven itself and that has supported the European audiovisual sector since it launched."
"We are now in the fourth generation of this programme, and the fact that we have stuck with the basic structure, whilst innovating with regard to the precise elements linked to technological progress, shows that the programme has demonstrated its worth, that it is important, that it is unanimously recognised by those in the sector and that it is vital to the future of our audiovisual creativity and heritage."
"Mr President, I am delighted at the European Parliament's unwavering support, and in particular at the constructive and unfailing support of its rapporteur Mrs Hieronymi."
"The recommendation for second reading marks a new step towards a speedy entry into force of the programme in 2007."
"Parliament has done its part, and the final decisions now need to be taken by the Council."
"I hope that this will enable those working in the audiovisual sector to benefit from next year, smoothly and seamlessly, from this aid that is so vital to them for many reasons: firstly, for European cultural diversity, secondly, for the creation of European productions, and, finally, for the robustness of the content industry."
"For my part, I am going to promote, as in the past, the adoption of this decision, which will be a crucial step for the future of the European audiovisual sector."
"Mr President, today's proposal for the adoption by the European Parliament of the common position on the decision to implement a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector is due, I would say, to the personal persistence and systematic work of a great many people, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Ruth Hieronymi, whom I too, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, honestly congratulate, together with the leading person working on the MEDIA series of programmes, Commissioner Reding."
"In cooperation with the European Commission and the Council, we have come to the final version of the text of the MEDIA 2007-2013 programme, which gives especial added value to the development of the European audiovisual sector which, apart from its economic benefit and importance and the anticipated contribution to the development of employment in the European Union and of the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry, also has a particular social and cultural value."
"The audiovisual sector today has huge potential for combating gender stereotypes and cultivating the attitudes and conduct of European communities on the basis of traditions, unchanged values and respect for the dignity and uniqueness of human beings."
"Thanks to the contribution of the European Parliament to the strengthening of the pre-productive and post-productive stage of the majority of European audiovisual producers, the new MEDIA 2007 will continue to highlight their importance for the promotion of cultural dialogue and linguistic and cultural heritage."
"We also hope that, within the framework of the globalisation of competitiveness and of the strategic objectives of Lisbon, a European industry will be promoted which is respected, strong and of differentiated content, in order to develop European values and make them accessible, by giving greater attention to the promotion of the lesser spoken languages ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like once again to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi, the rapporteur, who has skilfully made MEDIA 2007 into an excellent document with which to support the European film industry."
"I am glad but also concerned; glad that support for digitalisation has become a central part of the MEDIA 2007 programme, but concerned that, at the present level of funding, the European film industry will not be competitive."
"Digitalisation is a challenge that the European audio-visual sector needs in order to develop its ability for innovation."
"Digitalisation could become an effective means of overcoming the division of the European market."
"I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and all of my colleagues who supported my positions as shadow rapporteur."
"As regards the present situation, the proportion of US production on European television stations has once again reached a record level."
"Hollywood also rules our cinemas."
"There was a time when the cinema belonged to Fassbinder and the French new wave."
"More recently it belonged to Kaurismäki and the Dogma group."
"Now the intelligent European audience wants to see Asian film production."
"I know that the rise of brilliant filmmakers depends largely on chance."
"The present underfunding means that the next European film genius may go to work in America or go into another field of work altogether."
"The media is not just an industry."
"The media is a means for the creation of identity, and it is because the European Union cannot function without European identity that I would like to emphasise once again how essential it is that we support our film industry."
"I would like to thank you all for the work you have done, but I must conclude by saying that what has been achieved in the area of financing is below the level it was at when we began work."
"For that reason, I feel sorry for Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is already a year since, at first reading, we welcomed the excellent work by the rapporteur, whom I would like to congratulate once again on her more recent work."
"Furthermore, last September, Mrs Hieronymi, myself and other MEPs discussed these topics with members of the Italian Government and operators in the sector, during a long and interesting debate on the occasion of the 57th year of the prestigious Venice film festival."
"We appreciate that there has been a delay."
"The European Parliament has, with a great sense of responsibility, acted extremely swiftly and today brings to the attention of the Chamber the final text of the report on the MEDIA programme, which has of course been much improved, making resources more accessible to potential beneficiaries, strengthening cooperation with other Community programmes in the areas of education, training and research, as well as creating easier access to credit for the audiovisual industry in order to remedy the chronic underinvestment in the sector."
"Moreover, the use of new technologies represents an inevitable shift towards rationalising costs and consequent competitiveness."
"I therefore propose that the Commission should take it upon themselves to evaluate the pilot projects carried out and to share experiences where they have been successful."
"In conclusion, I would like to relaunch the proposal that I made to this House last year, in relation to the report on preserving our film heritage, to create a thematic European film archive to safeguard a careful selection of films on historical events and on events relating to the development of the Community project."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start with warm thanks to Mrs Hieronymi for her work and to Commissioner Reding for her good cooperation."
"What our media policy is in fact about is the further development of the specific aesthetic language of European films."
"At the heart of our cultural self-image is the desire to fight against Hollywood's dominance, to show our own films, characterised as they are by European diversity, and to facilitate their production and distribution."
"Although we know that the audio-visual industry is also of enormous importance in terms of the Lisbon Strategy and of Europe's economic development, this is not just about the economy; it is also, in a profound sense, about cultural policy and about cultural identity and cultural diversity."
"I agree with the previous speakers who have highlighted under-capitalisation and the need for a rapid start to be made, and for our media programme to be better funded."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I also would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, on her work and Commissioner Reding on her work in support of this programme."
"I support the continuation of the MEDIA programme for the period 2007-2013."
"We must remember, as Europe integrates more closely, that it is very important that we seek to protect and promote our different cultural and linguistic diversities within the EU itself."
"We must always remember that the diversity of Europe is its greatest strength."
"In essence, the MEDIA programme will help to develop the audiovisual sector in Europe during the coming six years."
"Amendments by the European Parliament have ensured that the importance of European cinema is being recognised under the MEDIA programme for the purpose of intercultural dialogue, linguistic and cultural diversity and non-discrimination."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this proposal has been another plank in the attempts to impose EU ideals and censorship on an unsuspecting public."
"It is less about support to industries in the EU, and more about protecting them from outside competition in the real world."
"I have to ask: why is this proposal necessary?"
"Well, maybe because in implementing such a programme the EU can exploit yet another area where its message can be delivered to folk who will not believe or contemplate that they are being manipulated."
"I quote: 'It is to be recalled that (...) the programme MEDIA has now clearer references to the importance of European cinema for intercultural dialogue'."
"But it wholly ignores the bigger intercultural dialogue between the different European cultures and those of the wider world, for instance that of the Indian subcontinent."
"Not only that, but each and every aspect of this report duly sets out another attempt to interfere with commercial activity."
"We are told that the programme will cost EUR 671 million."
"We also know that he who pays the piper calls the tune."
"But where is the added value?"
"Who benefits?"
"It ignores what folk might want to see, given freedom of choice."
"However, the EU will benefit by distorting the marketplace in the minds of citizens."
"Ah yes, EU citizens, those poor folk who had citizenship forced upon them, from which there is as yet no escape!"
"(PL) I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"As we are all aware, the audiovisual sector is a very important element of our economy."
"Over a million people are employed in it."
"This sector also plays a crucial social and cultural role, because almost every European household boasts a television set."
"Unfortunately, and it pains me to say so, films produced in Europe represent only 26% of the European film market, as opposed to the 71% accounted for by American productions."
"I cannot agree with the previous speaker that some kind of force is involved here."
"It is indeed incumbent upon us to provide European audiences with a choice."
"This must, however, be a choice involving good quality European productions, because the percentages I mentioned just now certainly do not reflect the quality of the films we are able to watch."
"It is therefore to be hoped that the MEDIA 2007 programme will help to redress the balance."
"Strengthening European cultural diversity and European cinema production is a noble aim, but it can only be achieved by simultaneously strengthening the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector."
"Obviously, digitalisation is one way to combat fragmentation and under-investment in the European film market, but what is really required is a better distribution system on the European market and also on the international markets."
"Nowadays, technological progress in terms of digital services facilitates better dissemination of European audiovisual products."
"However, the lack of private sector involvement, especially in the context of financing ventures in the audiovisual sphere, will not allow the MEDIA 2007 programme to be fully implemented."
"The current offer concerning credit for audiovisual production is very inadequate, particularly regarding films created by small and medium-sized producers."
"The same is true of the grants available to young filmmakers."
"I trust the MEDIA 2007 programme will not go to waste."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, today is a particularly important day for the Committee on Culture and Education, with the reports by my honourable friends Mrs Hieronymi, Mr Graça Moura, Mrs Gröner, Mrs Pack and Mr Takkula on the multiannual programmes for the audiovisual sector, culture, youth, education and European nationality tabled for final approval by plenary."
"The members of our committee merit congratulations."
"Despite the delay in approving the programmes, which was due to difficulties in reaching agreement on the financial perspective, we believe that the resources which will be made available, even though inadequate, will allow these programmes to continue to offer their benefits."
"In particular, the MEDIA programme may play an important role in improving the competitiveness of the European cinema industry, by giving financial support to the development of audiovisual works, the training of professionals in the sector and the strengthening of the distribution and circulation of European works."
"We also need to highlight here the efforts made by Mrs Reding."
"The development and promotion of European films is of decisive importance to the maintenance of cultural diversity and economic development and employment."
"Unfortunately, the great wealth of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe is also the cause of an even greater structural problem on the audiovisual market."
"I refer to the extensive fragmentation of the national markets, which does not allow the European cinema industry to acquire a larger share of the European and global market."
"MEDIA 2007 needs to help combat the lack of cross-border circulation of European works."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs Hieronymi for her excellent work and Commissioner Reding for the positions she has adopted."
"I think it is very important to support the audiovisual sector and European cinema in order to ensure diversity and plurality in Europe and to work towards the main aims of the European Union."
"I think that it is also very important for endangered cultures, for the languages of stateless nations, for minority languages and so on. The reference in the report to the regional and local levels is very important, because it focuses on the need for real diversity in the European Union."
"That is a great support."
"Also, we have to support independent producers in order to enrich audiovisual output and make it more in tune with reality and with European culture."
"(EL) Mr President, if you watch television in any country of the European Union and do not see the news, you think that you are in the United States."
"The American culture reigns; that repulsive culture with violence, crime, rape and so on which enters our homes so easily."
"We need to protect the European family from this culture, which does not suit us."
"Clearly, therefore, we need to strengthen European cinema; we need to strengthen the culture and civilisation of this continent, but I greatly fear that the means introduced in the report are powerless."
"Television is 'nitro-glycerine' in the hands of the person controlling it."
"It provides the food that person wants."
"I would refer to Euro News, which we fund, which a short while ago called all the Italians mafia for something to do with football."
"Euro News comes along and makes its own policy, saying 'Macedonia', unlike the European Union, which calls this country FYROM."
"The point, therefore, is that we need to give financial support and, at the same time, control where our money is going and how some of it is being spent."
"This is an important matter, if we want to be successful on a vital issue, because it is opinion-forming."
"Of course, the history of the Member States can also be strengthened, if you want."
"I do not know the history of Poland, just as Poland does not know the history of Greece."
"We are now one family. We should know where everyone comes from."
"Who we are and where we want to go."
"So this needs to be funded and I hope that such provision is made, but of course it needs daring and not the method with which we are approaching things today."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, I would once again like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Culture and Education and its chairman and rapporteur, for their valuable assistance in the interests of European creativity and cinematographic diversity."
"I share the opinions and the concerns of those Members who say that, unfortunately, the funding is not adequate for our ambitions."
"We have not received the funding we asked for: it is regrettable but true."
"We must therefore act to ensure that the new programme, with less funding, is an opportunity to wipe the slate clean and to concentrate on those actions that have real European added value, while calling on the national governments to take responsibility for the other actions."
"As the rapporteur has already explained very well, we will then stick with the actions that have proven themselves over the years."
"Having said that, we will also add, for example, support for video on demand, which is becoming a priority."
"We will also support digitisation, which is a particular opportunity for the circulation of European productions, and we will increase support for distribution in order to create the necessary synergies for the era of online film."
"We are also going to introduce a new action to support the presence of European films on the emerging markets in other continents."
"Those are the most important elements of this initiative, which enjoys the almost unanimous support of the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and those in the sector."
"Mr President, thank you for Parliament's assistance, which will be understood, from the outside, by both viewers and creators of audiovisual productions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Culture programme (2007-2013) (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Culture and Education on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013)(06235/3/2006 - C6-0269/2006 - (Rapporteur: Mr Graça Moura)."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process that will culminate in the vote on the Culture Framework Programme 2007-2013 at second reading has been complex and slow: slow essentially because of a series of setbacks regarding the financial perspective, as we all recall, and complex due to the nature of the issue and to the varied range of contributions to the debate from all members of the other committees that issued their opinions with the members of the committee directly concerned."
"What ensued from all of these contributions was rich dialogue on the Culture Framework Programme 2007-2013, which subsequently went from first reading to the current stage of proceedings. This process was marked by formal and informal interventions from both the Commission and the Council, leading to fruitful exchanges of views and consensus positions that can only be viewed as extremely positive."
"As a result of all of this, most of the amendments adopted by this Chamber at first reading have been enshrined in the common position."
"Of these amendments, I wish to highlight the explicit reference, in the recitals and in the body of Article 3, to the importance of a common cultural heritage shared by Europeans, an idea that encapsulates the objectives of the programme."
"We must accordingly monitor, at all times, the implementation of the specific objectives laid down by the programme relating to this enormously extensive heritage, which has for centuries been ingrained in all fields of human activity. Given that these fields relate to our civilisation and culture, they also reflect our identity."
"It has also been possible to agree on satisfactory arrangements for the duration of the actions, scheduled to take between one and five years; for the intervention of cultural operators, the number of which per country will vary according to the nature of the action; and for the funds from the budget granted to each of the sectors concerned, in particular the granting of additional resources for cooperation measures, that is to say, for smaller projects, as opposed to larger-scale or multiannual cooperation projects."
"This will make it possible to consider actions by small-scale operators, who tend to be closest to the citizens, without neglecting the larger-scale, more visible actions that involve more countries over a longer period of time."
"In addition to all of this, I would like to highlight the provision for special actions aimed at raising awareness among Europe's citizens of cultural diversity in the Member States."
"Some of these actions are already provided for, such as the European capitals of culture, and support for European bodies operating in the field of culture, which, very importantly, function as ambassadors for European culture, and many of which have received crucial backing from Parliament in the past."
"If the rules change on account of the financial regulations in force and these bodies thus find themselves having to apply for the aid they need under the Culture Programme 2007-2013, it is vital that they are not overlooked and that they remain able to pursue their actions."
"The Commission and the Council expect that the multidisciplinary nature of the programme will make it highly flexible and able to support many innovative proposals."
"In spite of some reservations that I expressed during the debate at first reading, I sincerely hope that they are right."
"Against this backdrop of the institutions working together and heading in the same direction, there is just one negative point, which is easy to spot."
"I refer to what can only be described as the very meagre resources granted to the Culture Programme 2007-2013."
"At first reading, a number of us who contributed to the debate - in other words, not only me, the rapporteur - drew attention to this point."
"This is a third generation programme aimed at going further and being more effective than previous ones. It is a programme that encompasses a broader range of actions and boasts a larger number of interested Member States."
"It also involves higher management and monitoring costs, and yet the budgetary appropriation falls well short of what it needs to achieve these objectives and well short of what all those responsible - the members of the Commission, the ministers of culture, the cultural agents and operators, and the politicians - feel is absolutely vital."
"Even so, I feel that we should express the wish that the Culture Programme 2007-2013 is a great success and that it makes an eloquent contribution to the development of the Europe to which we are all committed."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I am pleased to be here at the end of the second round of negotiations."
"I sense a very positive feeling about proceeding with the final vote and decision."
"We are now looking at the range of programmes for which I am responsible, including youth, education and the citizenship programme."
"We start with culture."
"This is highly symbolic and very important because we believe that, as in the past, culture can provide many important answers to the future of Europe."
"Let me remind you that in December 2004 President Barroso said that cultural values rank higher than economic ones, because the economy helps us to live, but it is culture that makes life worth living."
"I am pleased to say that an excellent climate of cooperation between our institutions characterised the whole legislative process and brought us to a very satisfactory compromise."
"I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, for his excellent work and, for similar reasons, the whole Committee on Culture and Education, under its chairman Mr Sifunakis."
"Its support for this programme is an important contribution to the forthcoming decision."
"I am also very pleased that the general line proposed by the Commission in the original proposal has been welcomed by both Parliament and the Council."
"The next Culture Programme will thus promote, firstly, the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector, secondly, the transnational circulation of works of art, as well as of artistic and cultural products, and, thirdly, intercultural dialogue."
"I am equally convinced that the programme will contribute to the flourishing of multilateral cooperation within Europe, as well as to the development of a European identity, thanks to the interactions which we encourage between citizens."
"We will have EUR 400 million at our disposal."
"I also wish to thank the European Parliament for its support."
"We might envisage more support, but we first have to be aware of the limits and, secondly, support is growing and there will be more opportunities to organise cooperation."
"However, as Mr Graça Moura has just said, we need to be efficient."
"I want to confirm that the Commission is able to accept the three amendments contained in the report; they correspond to the compromise between our three institutions."
"I very much hope that the next Culture Ministers' Council in November will reach a final decision."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I support the overall aim of this programme, namely strengthening the common European cultural area and reinforcing the sense of European citizenship."
"These are very laudable aims."
"I was, however, surprised to read, in part of the Council's common position of June of this year, that the Culture Programme (2007-2013) contributes to, I quote 'the strengthening of the transversal objectives of the Community, by contributing to the elimination of all discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation'."
"Transversal Community objectives - what kind of newspeak is that, ladies and gentlemen?"
"Are we witnessing a renaissance of Socialist Realism?"
"Does this all mean that the key criterion used in the assessment of future projects will be their supposed impact on discrimination?"
"Perhaps it would be best to entrust the assessment of the projects to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna or to the recently established European Institute for Gender Equality."
"I would like to point out that I did not find a reference of that nature in the earlier version of the programme, Culture 2000."
"Europe was divided for over 50 years."
"Our programme should therefore provide an opportunity for increased awareness and understanding of the cultural diversity of the nations of Europe and the cultures suppressed by Communist totalitarianism in Central and Eastern Europe in particular."
"This should be the thinking underpinning the projects in the new version of the Culture Programme (2007-2013)."
"Culture should be perceived as a means of facilitating the cultural integration of 27 Member States, rather than as an integrated world view."
"Culture must enjoy complete freedom."
"It promotes the cause of freedom most effectively when it is involved in spreading it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, on the work he has done on the fundamental topic of the Culture 2007 programme and, in particular, on the agreement he has reached on behalf of the European Parliament."
"I would like briefly to go over the three points that I championed for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament within the Committee on Culture and Education."
"Firstly, with regard to the transversal aspect of the programme, it must be noted that the agreement reached goes in the right direction: nobody can object to increasing the coherence of the programme, which will make it possible to put a stop to the fragmentation that for a long time has characterised the European Union's cultural activities."
"However, intentions are one thing, and the resources proposed are quite another."
"I now come to my second point, the issue of the budget, which was also mentioned just now by the rapporteur and by the Commissioner, too."
"I would say this, and I will keep saying it for as long as necessary: there is no point in the European Union setting ambitious objectives such as promoting cultural diversity and cooperation if the available budget is not up to it, being no more than 15 cents per citizen per year."
"We have called for a substantial increase in the budget allocated to the programme, so that it can play a part in the rise of a European culture and identity, which will enable us to move beyond national self-interest, and hence to escape from the crisis from which the Union has been suffering for a year and a half now."
"It has to be said that the 2007-2013 financial perspective, stabilising Community expenditure at 1% of the European Union's GDP, will not allow us to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves in this programme or to give culture the role we intend for it in the building of a stronger Europe with greater solidarity."
"Therefore, we cannot allow ourselves to punish this programme for a second time by delaying its implementation."
"As Aristide Briand said, if we cannot have the means for our policy, we must have the policy for our means."
"We therefore need to act quickly to implement this programme soon, so that we do not disadvantage the cultural organisations on the ground, which rely on this funding and which have been waiting for months for a decision to be taken."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I would like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura on the quality of his work and to thank him for the favourable attention he always paid to our proposals."
"His report is excellent, which is hardly surprising coming from this Portuguese writer who is such an ardent defender of the Portuguese language."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would urge Parliament to give him its full support."
"This programme covers the following objectives: promoting the transnational mobility of people working in the culture sector, encouraging the transnational circulation of works of art and cultural and artistic products, and promoting intercultural dialogue."
"That said, one wonders how, with such a limited budget, we will be able to safeguard and promote linguistic diversity and encourage language learning and the teaching of music and performing arts."
"One also wonders how this programme will be able to promote and develop the European Union's external visibility thanks to the promotion of its cultural diversity and of the aspects common to all its cultures."
"I am therefore very disappointed that the Commission has not understood the vital role that culture plays in our European identity, and I find it particularly serious that it felt able, on the basis of the interinstitutional agreement containing the financial perspective for 2007-2013, to approve such a tight budget, amounting to only EUR 354 million, compared to the 600 million called for by the rapporteur and the 408 million proposed by the Commission."
"The budget for the 'culture programme 2007' for the period 2007-2013 now represents just 0.04% of the European Union's budget granted in the financial perspective."
"All artists in Europe will be amazed that the European institutions still consider culture to be the icing on the cake, as a luxury that takes second place to necessities."
"If promoting culture involves raising awareness levels and curbing obfuscation, this shrunken budget is not the way for Europe to set an example."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura for his work on this important aspect of our European policy."
"People like to quote, whenever we discuss the significance of cultural policy for Europe, the saying to the effect that 'You do not fall in love with the internal market', for Europe adds up to more than just the internal market, even though it is something we cannot do without."
"Europe has a great deal to do with the cultural identity and our cultural riches, which we want to preserve and develop."
"Culture can divide people from one another, particularly when it emphasises differences, but our cultural policy is aimed at bringing the people of Europe together through culture, establishing contacts between them, making it possible for them to establish contact with, and feel a sense of belonging in, the world, indeed, with different, and in diverse, worlds."
"The smoothing away of differences is not something that we should be in fear of; it is something to be encouraged, something that is at the heart of our European cultural policy."
"That is why the three objectives - the encouragement of cultural exchange, the mobility of artists and cultural dialogue - are the right ones, but the amount of money voted earlier will not enable them to be achieved."
"If we want to do more for Europe on the cultural front, we will have to muster the courage to set a bigger cultural budget over the coming years."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, a nation's standard of living is a function of material assets, but its identity is determined by its culture, in the broadest sense of the term."
"Culture is a nation's true wealth, and the driving force behind its existence and development."
"Culture also constitutes a platform where nations can reach understanding and integrate."
"Culture develops through a historical process."
"It does not take kindly to brutal interventions or to being forced to develop along specific lines."
"Culture needs freedom."
"The Culture Programme (2007-2013) we are debating today is intended to organise the aims and restrict their number."
"It also aims to support the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector, the transnational circulation of works of art, as well as of artistic and cultural products, and also intercultural dialogue."
"From the simplistic point of view of European integration, the proposed aims are understandable."
"From the point of view of cultural development, and the meaning and multifunctionality of culture, the approach is too narrow to be accepted without further ado."
"It is essential to include action for the protection and support of the sources of culture, especially where they are under threat."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"European cultural heritage is a major part of our Union's wealth and I am therefore grateful to the three institutions for the efforts made so far to safeguard and promote it."
"The great value of the Culture programme, which I hope will also be retained in the next programming period, lies not only in promoting the mobility of persons and works in the sector within the Community, but above all in the great opportunity that this represents for small operators and small communities in the EU to keep their own histories and identities alive."
"Promoting individual cultures at local level is in fact extremely valuable, as much for the European Union in general, which bases its unity and strength on the diversity within its borders, as for the economy of the social fabric and regional realities at all levels."
"I therefore fully support the Council's proposal to find a balance between small- and large-scale projects, to make it easier for small operators to access the programme, and to allocate half of the available funds to these kinds of measures."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I welcome the very positive responses; there may be still some pressure for doing more."
"We all want to do more for culture, because it is important for the European mentality and European identity; for living together in one broader and broader house."
"I think that the best narrative of Europe is diversity and unity."
"Diversity growing means an invitation to promote and deepen unity, and unity based on values is mostly promoted via our cultural programme."
"I am sure that some points that were mostly to do with the budget are invitations to do more in future."
"If you recall the previous programme, we had seven cents per culture, per year, per citizen - Mr Bono mentioned that now we will have 15 cents."
"There were invitations to do ten times more - 70 cents per culture."
"I just want to remind people that the budgetary authority in the Union is Parliament."
"Your support, but also further support, will help to create more space."
"The citizenship programme is also based on the cultural Article 151 of the Treaty."
"First of all, this is the competence and basic responsibility of Member States."
"We are supporting Member States in their cooperation, not replacing them."
"We will have the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in 2008 and the achievement in negotiating a new convention on cultural diversity protection and promotion under UNESCO shows the success of this Union."
"I want to assure Parliament that the implementation of the programme as soon as possible after the final decision will allow us quantitatively and qualitatively to do more for culture via Culture for Europe."
"I am sure that we will have many occasions to work together on the implementation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"Annex - Commission statement"
"The Commission would like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act establishing the culture programme (2007-2013) to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than on its final publication in the Official Journal."
"This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with."
"For the programme in question, the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 400 million."

"(FR) Mr President, my reference to the Rules of Procedure is based on Rule 6(7) and Rule 7 of the Rules relating to immunity."
"As no debate has taken place, there will be no oral explanations of vote."
"With regard to the case in which action is being taken against our fellow Member, Mr Borghezio simply because, following a judgment, he wrote the word 'Shame' on the pavement, a word that, moreover, it was possible to remove from the pavement, I shall simply say, following that hypocritical decision: shame on the rapporteur, shame on the Commission and shame on this Parliament of hypocrites and dissemblers who apply a variable-geometry case-law in the defence of immunity."
"in writing."
"I support Mr Chichester's report."
"I believe that the Galileo satellite system serves two vital purposes."
"Firstly, it will enable the EU, independent of the United States, in association with its partners, to develop and deploy a global satellite system that will give an autonomous capability in this area."
"Secondly, it shows symbolically the EU's commitment to playing an increasingly global role in world affairs."
"Regardless of the technological and material advantages that will accrue, this political dimension is vital in itself."
"in writing. (SV) I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the position put forward by the June List on 27 September of this year."
"I have voted against this report because it rejects the Council of Ministers' draft amending budget No 3."
"Unlike the majority of the Committee on Budgets, the June List believes that the Council of Ministers is perfectly entitled to redistribute expenditure between the different institutions of the EU in the course of the budget procedure, if it thinks this is the right thing to do."
"in writing. (SV) The amending budget is made up of three distinct elements covering completely different fields."
"I have chosen to vote against the whole package as put forward."
"When it comes to the total of EUR 259 million to be provided by way of financial support to encourage economic development within the Turkish Cypriot community, the following question arises: is there yet an overall solution designed to promote peaceful and stable development on Cyprus at a time when the EU is getting involved in this situation and contributing significant financial resources to Cyprus?"
"In respect of the appropriation for the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the June List is already on record as being sceptical towards the entire project."
"With regard to budgetary adjustments following modernisation of the accounting system, this is more of a technical issue, even if I am sceptical about the overall activities of the European Development Fund."
"in writing."
"I welcome this report."
"It endorses the EU proposal for a Strategic Partnership with South Africa which is comprehensive and which moves towards real political cooperation with the most significant political power in Sub-Saharan Africa and the strongest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 50% of the region's GDP."
"Whilst praising the considerable progress made in post-apartheid South Africa in consolidating a functioning parliamentary democracy as well as the economic strides made as a middle-income developing country and as a leader of the Southern African Development Community, the report focuses on the need to address the considerable social challenges still facing the country."
"These challenges include particularly the high incidence of HIV/AIDS (with 18.8% of the population currently infected) and rates of unemployment of more than 40%."
"I fully support the report's call for HIV/AIDS to be tackled as a priority for economic development, as well as its emphasis on the Strategic Partnership providing a single framework under which the existing EU cooperation instruments can improve performance in the interests of the South African population and economy."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Union is South Africa's largest trading partner and the biggest provider of development aid to that country."
"The South African economy accounts for 50% of the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa."
"South Africa is an engine of development for Africa and a political power working for peace in those regions of Africa that are in conflict."
"That is why I consider it essential, 12 years after the end of apartheid, for the European Parliament to support today the establishment of a Strategic Partnership with South Africa."
"The report emphasises the fight against AIDS."
"It also cites measures designed to promote economic revival and to combat social inequalities, and refers to integration and support for exchanges, as well as to incentives for foreign investment."
"It asks South Africa to use its influence to foster a peaceful solution to the political crisis in Zimbabwe."
"A new economic, social, health or political crisis would have a considerable impact on the whole of southern Africa, as well as on Réunion, which maintains many economic and cultural links with South Africa."
"If this agreement is important for Europe, it is vital to Réunion, as we have everything to gain from the stability of our South African neighbour and partner."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with reference to Mrs Isler Béguin's report on the Financial Instrument for the Environment, I would like to express my extreme concern for the environment regarding pensioners in Italy."
"I voted in favour of the report, but I would have voted for it much more willingly if this directive, as well as protecting the environment, had also protected Italian pensioners."
"I take this opportunity to protest against President Prodi's centre-left government, which has tabled an amendment to Article 85(6) of the budget law, deducting from the pensions of the 500 000 Italians who have worked in Switzerland a good three-quarters of the amount to which they are entitled in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Cassation."
"An environment in which pensioners are deprived of their right to a fair pension is not healthy."
"in writing. LIFE has proved to be an invaluable EU environmental policy since 1992."
"Now we have an opportunity for LIFE + to become even more valuable, in particular to the smaller and newer Member States, which could receive a more equal spread of budget over the period 2007-2013 of €2 billion."
"I fully support the Council proposal to delegate the implementation of 80-85% of the budget to national agencies and so I have voted against this Report."
"For example, the overall amount indicated for Ireland from the programme is €25m."
"This funding could then be doubled through co-financing instruments up to €50m."
"Environmental Projects in Ireland which could benefit under the seven- year programme include waste prevention, waste reduction and recycling initiatives, development of innovative technologies with positive environmental benefits, local and regional environmental awareness campaigns and the development of special conservation areas."
"in writing. (PT) The Council common position, to which this report relates, is substantially different from the Commission's original proposal in 2004."
"I wish to highlight the inclusion of the 'Nature and Biodiversity' component, the objectives of which include supporting the further development and implementation of the Natura 2000 network, including in relation to coastal and marine habitats and species, and, most importantly, stemming the loss of biodiversity in the Community by 2010."
"The inclusion of this component in the Life+ Programme tallies with the position adopted by Parliament at first reading in July 2005, and this is something we welcome."
"Despite the fact that we voted in favour of the programme and its objectives, we are compelled to express our disappointment that the budgetary resources earmarked for the Life+ Programme, covering the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013, are woefully inadequate, as a result of the disappointing agreement on the Budgetary Framework for 2007-2013."
"They fall short of the assessment made by the Commission itself, which, let us not forget, put the needs of the Natura 2000 network at EUR 6.1 billion per year, that is, EUR 3 billion under cofinancing. They also fall short of the amount proposed by the Commission in 2004."
"The guarantee of cofinancing the Natura 2000 network via the structural funds will not enable it to meet all of its needs."
"The LIFE+ Programme and its predecessors are the main funding instrument for the EU's environmental projects."
"The Council has acted wrongly and insensitively in substantially reducing the budgeted amount."
"Parliament has reintroduced the amount originally agreed upon, in line with the financial perspective, for funding the Natura 2000 network, which is aimed at preserving nature and biodiversity."
"An amendment has been incorporated aimed at ensuring that the European funds earmarked for the environment are not used for other purposes relating to the LIFE+ Programme, such as spending on human resources, because the Member States are to have a project management team, rather than the usual management by seconded staff."
"There is also a compromise amendment laying down that if no agreement is reached at second reading steps will be taken to ensure that funding of ongoing projects will continue."
"For Portugal, this report is very important because a large proportion of the mainland and the outlying areas forms part of the Natura 2000 network, funding for which is set out in this report."
"The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs therefore support the Isler Béguin report."
"in writing. Though I believe LIFE funding has done good work, the problem has been the excess of demand over supply and the difficulty of supervising what is going on because it involves fairly small payments to a large number of projects and this report does not address these issues."
"In 2003 the Court of Auditors looked at the LIFE scheme and found that financial beneficiaries failed to keep sufficiently transparent and detailed accounts."
"LIFE money was also found to be involved in substantial land purchases where there were insufficient guarantees that this land would continue to be used for nature conservation purposes once the implementation period for the actions was over."
"The Court asked whether the Commission had set up an adequate system of management."
"The answer is that, as the fund is currently organised, the Commission cannot do so."
"It is therefore perfectly acceptable and sensible for the management role to be devolved to the Member States."
"This does not mean that environmental schemes will suffer from the withdrawal of LIFE money, but that money may be better spent and more transparently supervised."
"in writing. I voted for the amendments to the common position on LIFE+."
"I am particularly concerned with the requirement for a 55% allocation of funds for nature and biodiversity."
"Important as these areas are, such a requirement would limit Member States' ability to allocate funds for projects addressing their own environmental priorities such as climate change."
"in writing. (SV) I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the June List's rejection at first reading in September 2005."
"The question we should ask ourselves is as follows: should the EU be dealing with political issues of this nature or do they fall within the area of competence of the Member States?"
"The June List's answer is clear: this is a matter for the Member States."
"If the Member States wish to pour extra resources into promoting their national film industries, they are obviously entirely in their rights so to do."
"The EU, on the other hand, should not be running special programmes to promote the European film industry."
"If a large number of EU countries believe it necessary to cooperate within this policy area, they can do so without the interference of the EU."
"Intergovernmental agreements or cooperation between film companies can take place outside the framework of the EU."
"The EU does not need further sweeping and expensive projects."
"The EU should instead strive for targeted cooperation on significant and truly cross-border issues."
"(DE) Mr President, I have voted against the Graça Moura report on the grounds that, firstly, the approach underlying the 2007-2013 cultural programme, namely that cultural networks need subsidy only at their outset and become self-financing thereafter, goes against their non-commercial character and runs counter to the sustainability of support grants intended by the EU."
"This cultural programme also formulates intercultural dialogue in abstract terms, so that this objective might well refer to anything or nothing, and transparency is therefore out of the question; that is another reason why I have voted against this report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Romagnoli for his technical support, which has enabled me to explain my vote on the report by Mr Graça Moura establishing the Culture Programme."
"I voted in favour as I am hopeful about the future of this European Union, but I should like to stress that there is no such thing as culture when, in Italy, Mr Prodi's Socialist-Communist government has decided, in accordance with Article 85(6) of the budget law, to deduct part of the pensions of the 500 000 Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland, thus ignoring the judgment of the Court of Cassation, which ruled that these very pensioners were entitled to draw four times their current pension."
"This is not fair, and I hope that 'culture' will also signify respect for pensioners' rights."
"in writing. (SV) Cultural issues are, of course, very important."
"The June List is of the opinion that cultural policy should, in principle, be handled by the Member States."
"As far as European cultural heritage is concerned, however, it may be justified for certain matters to be dealt with at Community level."
"Nevertheless, we believe that the appropriations given to this Culture Programme have been much too liberal, given that this is an activity that should essentially be the responsibility of the Member States."
"I have therefore voted against the amendments in this report."
"in writing. (PT) I should like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura on the position he put forward at second reading on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013)."
"I wish to express my support in particular for the amendment to the common position as regards financial support for the actions mentioned in Article 8(2)(d) of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Culture Programme (2007-2013)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Papadimoulis's report is slightly different to the previous ones, because it talks about the establishment of the Community civil protection mechanism."
"I voted in favour, even though I would have preferred this report to have provided not only for civil protection, but also for the protection of pensioners."
"I am referring to Italian pensioners, who should be protected by the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Prodi, and by his Socialist-Communist majority. They have decided, in accordance with Article 85(6) of the budget law, to deduct a good three-quarters from the pensions of the 500 000 Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland."
"This decision is in breach of the Court of Cassation rulings, which oblige the Italian Government to pay these pensioners the pensions that they deserve."
"in writing. (PT) The civil protection mechanism was set up five years ago to facilitate the mobilisation and coordination of civil protection resources in the event of emergencies inside or outside the EU."
"In 2005, more than ten countries activated this emergency response mechanism."
"The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the mechanism on the basis of the experience acquired since 2001, to lay down a legal basis for future Community action in the area of civil protection and to strengthen the rapid response and preparedness instrument for emergencies."
"This report includes the 'public health' dimension in civil protection."
"It also stresses the importance of solidarity among the Member States and of a more effective European monitoring system."
"Furthermore, it addresses the issue of effective land management and use in disaster prevention and the use of military assets to prevent and combat emergencies."
"This mechanism is vitally important for Europe as a whole, but in particular for Portugal, a country that is devastated every year by droughts and fires, which fall under the proposed mechanism."
"The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs therefore support the Papadimoulis report."
"in writing. (PT) The report adopted today, which is aimed at making the emergency response by the EU and the Member States more consistent and effective, is one that we broadly welcome, despite a few reservations."
"We know that the primary objective of civil protection is to prevent collective risks and the serious accidents or disasters arising from them. Hence the need to minimise these collective risks and to offset the impact should an emergency arise, to rescue and provide assistance to people and other living things, to protect cultural and environmental assets of major public interest, and to help the people affected to return to a normal life."
"Accordingly, we welcome the possibility of investing in studies, training, prevention and monitoring, and in fostering an exchange of experiences in order to learn from past experience - positive and negative - and to rectify any shortcomings."
"We also support the creation of a targeted, appropriate emergency communications network, the launch of extensive information campaigns, and the adoption of educational and awareness-raising initiatives aimed at the public and in particular the youngest members of society."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report."
"Prevention is a basic factor in reducing risks, but not every disaster can be prevented."
"Faced with emergencies, the European Union must no longer, therefore, rely on improvisation."
"'Man's habitual shortcoming is not to anticipate the storm during fine weather', said Machiavelli."
"The European Union must show that he was mistaken."
"Before implementing any action plan, it is important to draw up a list of existing resources, both material and human."
"It is on the basis of such information that vital coordination between the Member States will take shape with a view not only to tackling the disaster but also to ensuring that European action is more visible on the ground."
"It is just as crucial, moreover, to lose no time in arranging for new facilities to be installed in areas that we well know are at risk, particularly from fire and flood."
"The protection of the individual and solidarity between Member States are fundamental principles of the European Union."
"I do not, therefore, understand the Council's resistance to developing these civil protection actions, not to mention creating a special Community force."
"Yes, the initial responsibility for civil protection falls to the Member States, but that does not mean carrying on regardless."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. (SV) We welcome the Commission's proposal to improve the civil protection mechanism introduced in 2001."
"Europe, like the rest of the world, is hit by all kinds of disasters and crises, and it is clearly desirable to institute intensive coordination in order to respond to such events."
"Unfortunately, we have been forced to note that both the Commission's proposal and Mr Papadimoulis' report make explicit reference to military resources having to be available for civil protection activities."
"We are strongly opposed to all forms of initiative relating to military cooperation within the European Union."
"We therefore chose to abstain in the final vote on Mr Papadimoulis' report today and to vote against the Commission's proposal."
"The development of strong and adequate mechanisms to prevent and deal with natural disasters is fundamental for the protection, assistance and relief of the victims of natural disasters and for dealing with environmental disasters."
"In Greece, the inadequacy of such mechanisms was revealed again during the recent floods in several areas."
"In particular in the strategy for preventing and restoring disasters (anti-flood protection, reinforcement against earthquakes) and relieving victims, the policy of the Greek Government presents criminal shortcomings."
"One transnational civil protection mechanism may help in dealing with natural disasters."
"However, it cannot and must not replace the extension and reinforcement of independent mechanisms in the Member States."
"Similarly, civil protection mechanisms cannot operate to cover up responsibilities for deliberately causing environmental disasters."
"The creation of mechanisms which undertake to deal with disasters due to deliberate action or negligence (as proposed) gives an even larger margin for unaccountable action by companies, with disastrous consequences for the environment and public health."
"Primarily, however, the establishment of mechanisms to respond to 'terrorist action' cannot be accepted."
"Practice over recent years confirms that the fight against 'terrorism' is designed to stifle and direct the grassroots movement, the class, trade-union movement."
"The 'prevention of terrorism' through the monitoring mechanisms which it is proposed to strengthen is leading to more restrictions on fundamental democratic rights."
"in writing. I voted in favour of this report because I believe given the cost of 'disasters' on Member States in terms of human lives, economic losses and injuries, it makes sense to pool resources and thus pursue economies of scale in areas such as logistics and transport."
"It is well known that, in Europe, civil protection in relation to natural disasters falls within the competence of the Member States."
"Unfortunately, in some of these countries, there are worrying delays and a sense of indifference, due to a lack of coordination."
"It is precisely for this reason that, for years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a European Civil Protection Agency that would have the task of bringing the various national laws in line with each other and that would be responsible not only for preventing and anticipating risks, but also for managing emergencies."
"Strangely enough, in fact, neither the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies nor the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community civil protection mechanism take into full and due consideration all of the activities aimed at studying and determining the causes of disasters, at identifying the risks and at singling out the more vulnerable regions subject to such risks - in other words, the 'anticipation' of risks - even though they are crucial when it comes to tackling natural disasters effectively."
"This Agency, created on the model of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, should not only repair the damage caused by natural disasters, but also, and above all, fund preventative actions aimed at eliminating or reducing the causes of such disasters."
"in writing. (SV) I am opposed to the Commission's proposal that the Member States should make use of each other's military capabilities."
"A coordination centre able to assist in directing fire-fighting helicopters to where they are most needed at the time is, however, a sensible and cost-effective idea."
"Moreover, when major disasters strike, there is a great lack of highly advanced fire-damage prevention, and it would therefore be a very good thing if we were able to get help to each other quickly in such situations."
"This is precisely the kind of cooperation that the EU should be undertaking."
"I am voting in favour of the report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how can there be any transparency in Europe when, in one of the 25 Member States - namely Italy - 500 000 pensioners who have worked in Switzerland and returned to Italy are paid pensions equal to 25% of the amount paid to Italian workers who work in Italy?"
"It is true that Switzerland is not yet part of the European Union, but it is part of the European Economic Area."
"It would be good if a Member State of the European Union behaved properly towards those of its own citizens who have worked abroad and who are entitled to the same pension as citizens residing in Italy."
"(DE) Mr President, speaking also on behalf of the Austrian People's Party delegation, let me say that there are several reasons why I voted against this report."
"One is the demand contained in it for persons who have entered the European Union illegally to be accorded equal rights with - or, indeed, more rights than - legal immigrants as regards such things as the right to accommodation, family benefits, health care and access to educational institutions."
"The report also presses for new grounds for the grant of asylum, for example to a person who has been forced into marriage or has agreed to what is termed an arranged marriage."
"Giving in to these demands will do nothing to solve problems, but will instead create new ones, for measures like these do in fact exert a suction effect, attracting even more illegal immigrants."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted against the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, and I shall now proceed to explain why."
"If one is talking solely in terms of women who have migrated legally, then one must certainly help them to become familiar with our system of standards and values, to become integrated and also to help their families to do so."
"It is particularly when one comes to the second or third generation of immigrants that conflicts can arise, which - as we have had to learn from the French experience - can result in acts of violence that may even be unavoidable."
"We must, however, come what may, prevent culturally and religiously motivated problems such as forced marriages, honour killings and genital mutilation from occurring in the first place."
"Family reunifications involving second, third or fourth wives - which go against the prohibition, customary in Europe, of bigamy - must be brought to an end without delay."
"It is because the report makes no such requirement that I have voted against it."
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted against the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, since I take the view that it blurs the dividing line between legal and illegal immigration, fails to draw an adequate distinction between our positions on the two and thereby, ultimately, constitutes a positive incitement to illegal immigration."
"I see that as politically misguided and as sending the wrong message."
"Legal immigration needs to be better organised and regulated, while every form of the illegal variety needs to be combated."
"At the end of the day, I take the view that we should solve the problems that exist on the ground in developing countries and should get much more directly involved in this than we have been to date if we are to get human, economic, social and religious problems out of the way."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy your lunch, since I believe that this is today's last explanation of vote."
"I voted in favour of the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report on the role and place of women immigrants in the European Union."
"In this instance, too, I would have preferred the report to have included something in relation to the position of the 260 000 or so Italian women who have emigrated to Switzerland in order to work and support their families and who, once back in Italy, have drawn a pension equal to 25% of the amount that they would have received if they had worked under the same conditions in Italy, and this despite the mutual agreement between Italy and Switzerland."
"I do not think it right to behave in this manner towards women in general, and especially not towards those women who are old-age pensioners."
"Long live pensioners!"
"in writing. Although we all agree that the plight of irregular immigrants is something that we have to work hard on, and that these unfortunate people should be treated with all the dignity a human being deserves, we must not forget that the influx of irregular foreigners into our countries is causing a big headache to the authorities, especially in Mediterranean countries."
"I therefore think it would be wiser to amend the Dublin II regulations prior to committing ourselves to something that may prove to be too big for us."
"We are obliged to do so, not only when considering the state our detention centres are in and the pressure that they are causing in our countries, but also out of respect for the immigrants themselves."
"We should not give them false hopes."
"I think we should get our house in order prior to offering something which at present I am sure we cannot guarantee."
"I urge all concerned for the umpteenth time to grab the bull by the horns and make a genuine effort to have Dublin II amended"
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of the report on women's immigration."
"The fundamental rights of immigrants must be respected and should not be dependent on gender or on belonging to a specific group within society."
"We support joint management of migration policy, which is a natural extension of cooperation under the Schengen Agreement."
"We are, on the other hand, opposed to a common integration policy because this area is best dealt with by the Member States themselves."
"We are also against the introduction of registers of female genital mutilation as this would represent an intrusion into privacy that we cannot support."
"(PT) Female immigration is known to be rising steadily in the EU, currently accounting for some 54% of the total number of immigrants. The reasons for it fall into a number of categories, including economic migration, family reunification, and seeking refuge and asylum."
"Women often face a large number of difficulties and forms of discrimination. Public support mechanisms, particularly social structures and services, must therefore be strengthened."
"It is particularly important that international conventions are implemented, especially the one on family reunification. The human rights of immigrant women - including access to education for their children, the right to family benefits and the right to healthcare - must also be guaranteed, whether or not their situation is legal."
"In any event, we believe that immigrant women entering an EU Member State for the purposes of family reunification must be given the opportunity to obtain their own legal status independently of their spouse as quickly as possible."
"We also feel that immigrant women and young people should be allowed to reside in a Member State and should be accorded all the support they need, especially those who have suffered physical and mental violence, including the practice of forced or arranged marriages."
"in writing. - (FR) The report devoted to immigrant women is alarming."
"Indeed, the situations it depicts (absence of personal status, exploitation, mutilation, crimes of honour etc...) point to the terrible failure of policies on immigration and integration."
"The report seems to demonstrate that immigrant populations intend to carry on with their practices and customs in the European Union, regardless of the fact that some of these are in flagrant violation of our laws and values."
"It neglects to mention that immigrant women themselves, or those of immigrant descent, sometimes attach more value to respect for their traditions than to respect for the law and that they are, then, very far from being, as the rapporteur naïvely imagines, instrumental in promoting their children's integration."
"It also overlooks the fact that marriage of a national of non-European origin with someone from their country of origin has - in France and certainly in other EU countries - become the mean reason for immigration, ahead of family reunification."
"When they are marriages of convenience, such marriages are a source of illegal immigration."
"When they are not, the fact is that, despite his or her nationality on paper, one of the spouses is not integrated and is not about to be, either."
"If we continue down this road, we shall only promote further ghettoisation in our societies and increase the risk of confrontation between communities."
"in writing. (SV) The June List has previously stated that the EU is a union of values."
"In the light of this, I have chosen to support those wordings which make clear that all groups in society should have equal rights."
"The June List supports constructive measures designed to attain greater integration of vulnerable groups in society."
"We are nonetheless of the opinion that it is the national parliaments and the regional authorities that should, essentially, be dealing with this pressing issue."
"I am critical of the general trend whereby the institutions of the EU seek to extend their influence and competence within more and more areas."
"It is important to draw a clear dividing line between what is to be decided by the EU and what is to be decided at national and local level."
"in writing. - (FR) This report has completely lost the plot, combining as it does all the fantasies of the Left and the Greens."
"Here are just a few examples."
"Paragraph 7 calls on Member States to grant immigrant women whose status is irregular and whose children are attending school the right to family benefits and allowances."
"Paragraph 10 calls for the procedures for granting a residence permit to be simplified."
"Finally, paragraph 17 calls for women immigrants to be encouraged to participate more actively in the social and political life of host countries."
"Obviously, everything is being done to transform, as if by magic, something that is a problem - namely illegal immigration - into something that is all very fine, moral and humanistic, namely legal immigration."
"There is not a single word about putting policies in place for returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin."
"Nor is there anything about the possibility of implementing a coherent and effective codevelopment aid policy in these countries in order to put a stop to the growing exodus from, in particular, African countries."
"There is nothing but the desire, expressed from the beginning to the end of this report, to welcome ever more immigrants and to give them ever more rights."
"Reports like this one do not help build Europe."
"Rather, they destroy Europe."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against this report in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality because I consider paragraphs 6 and 7 to be unacceptable and inadmissible."
"Indeed, I am of the view that access to family benefits and health care for anyone whose situation is irregular would be an incitement to mass immigration, something that is unacceptable, given the immigration problems with which we are already faced."
"Moreover, an increase in illegal immigration would further exacerbate the conditions confronting migrants."
"The European Union cannot adopt a report that further encourages the work of people smugglers and that leads a lot of women to risk their lives in order to emigrate illegally to Europe in the sole hope of being able to receive social benefits."
"I should like, however, to emphasise that I am very committed to protecting women's rights."
"I consider that the efforts made to guarantee immigrant women's fundamental rights by means of this report are commendable, but everything must be avoided that might have harmful effects that would, in fact, make the situation of these women even more difficult."
"in writing. - (FR) Studies, statistics, reports, assessments ..."
"With Parliament's support, the European Commission has, for some months now, been busily analysing the social, professional, political, economic and family situations of immigrant women in host countries."
"That is all well and good, as there is at present little reliable information that can be used in this area, even though we all know that women, and in particular Muslim women, suffer all kinds of discrimination."
"What, however, concerns me about this report is the fact that it highlights the rights of immigrant women who have entered Europe illegally."
"The right to vote, the right to family allowances and housing benefits, the right to remain in the host country ..."
"The report calls for, and lists, a whole package of rights but, bizarrely, it has not a word to say about a policy of returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin or, again, about a co-development aid policy for all those countries, very often African ones, which are suppliers of immigration to Europe."
"Europe keeps on welcoming people left, right and centre."
"In reality, Europe is transforming something that it deems unacceptable, namely illegal immigration, into something that it deems to be humanitarian and moral, namely legal immigration for population purposes."
"in writing. This is an important report, much of which deserves to be implemented."
"Urgent action is required to improve recovery rates."
"However, my British Conservative colleagues and I are unable to support the report overall because we do not accept in principle that the long-term solution to many of the problems in this field is the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor, an idea which is reiterated in this report (paragraphs 43-45)."
"Such a Public Prosecutor would be an unacceptable interference in the constitutional responsibility of Member States for their judicial systems."
"Furthermore, as there is rightly widespread opposition to its introduction, emphasising its necessity is a dangerous diversion from tackling the real problems at hand."
"For this reason we are obliged to abstain on the final vote."
"in writing. (PT) The recovery of inappropriately used Community funds must be investigated on a case-by-case basis and requires greater attention, not least from the Member States."
"In this regard, I wish to highlight the example of the relocation of companies that have enjoyed the use of Community funding for years, and situations in which public health is put at risk in one or more Member States."
"Cooperation between the different Member States and bodies should facilitate and improve the swift recovery of the amounts concerned and prevent the companies or organisations involved from continuing to enjoy Community funding."
"This is a valid cause, but we object to it being used to launch a further drive towards federalism; the report proposes the creation of an EU-level public prosecutor's office and public prosecutor, which would be a further step in the scaling back of the Member States' sovereignty."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Membership of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Welcome"
"I am told that we have a distinguished visitor in the official gallery."
"It is Mr Akbar Ganji, renowned writer and journalist, who was released in March following a six-year jail sentence for his activities in support of democracy and press freedom in Iran."
"Mr Ganji, we welcome you most warmly to the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"The European Parliament actively supported Mr Ganji during his long spell in prison and his hunger strike and called for his release on several occasions, particularly in its Resolution on Iran of 13 October 2005 and also by means of several letters and interventions by the President of Parliament and by the chairpeople of the Delegation for relations with Iran and of the Human Rights Sub-Committee"
"In fact, Mr Ganji has taken part in a joint meeting of those bodies this afternoon, and I have no doubt that they will have gained much from his knowledge and experiences."
"Draft general budget for 2007 (Section III) - Draft general budget for 2007 (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII)"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for introducing us to this first budgetary debate for 2007."
"At the outset I should like to thank all those who brought us to this stage, particularly those in the secretariat of Parliament's Committee on Budgets and those associated with it."
"Without them it would have been impossible to get ourselves to this state of preparedness."
"In setting out the guidelines for the 2007 budget - one that is different from others in the sense that it has been the first budget in the new financial perspective - much of the first part of the year was spent in negotiating the result of the financial perspectives."
"Indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place, because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as, let us hope, the Financial Regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation."
"In terms of general considerations, there are three that I should like to set out, which have shaped our strategic thinking in the Budgets Committee in presenting this budget to Parliament."
"Firstly, as we noted in the annual policy strategy (APS) discussions in May, which form the basis for our preparation for this budget, the speed of globalisation outside Europe is shaping our policies."
"I believe we have rightly criticised the Commission for taking a laid-back and complacent view on this."
"We need to be able to take account in our budgetary policies of the effects of what is happening elsewhere in the world."
"Secondly, we are acutely aware that the results of the financial perspective discussions have left us with fewer resources than we might otherwise have hoped, and therefore lead to the need for prioritisation in the way in which we shape our policies."
"Thirdly, we must communicate better with our citizens and give them the confidence that we are capable of running the budget effectively."
"That being said, what has the process now led to in what we voted for?"
"First is the general outlook."
"In terms of commitments I believe we have been very prudent in allowing significant margins in the various parts of the budget, well under the ceilings provided for in the IIA; and for the first time since 2000 we are not requesting the flexibility instrument."
"On the question of payments, we have taken a horizontal approach that reflects the approach taken by Reimer Böge, as our rapporteur on the financial perspectives - whose report Parliament adopted - in outlining a number of priority areas; and this is what we have reflected in taking payments on first reading to 1.04%, yet again well beneath the ceiling allowed for 2007 of 1.06%."
"This is also keeping a ratio between commitments and payments below 80% in most cases."
"In terms of the pilot projects and preparatory actions, we have a range of different possibilities; in terms of internal policies, where we are wanting to underpin innovation, and where we are looking in terms of security at a major initiative on migration management, thanks to our friend and colleague Mr Deprez from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; and, last but not least, on external policy, to see what we can do to build up linkages with China and India, because, as reflected from the outset, in the present globalising world we do not have the right kind of networks which link our business and scientists with those of China and India."
"We are putting these in as preparatory actions to be approved under the 2007 budget."
"Lastly in terms of payments, I have mentioned the common foreign and security policy, the CFSP."
"There are some in the Council who think that we are not being particularly generous in leaving it at a cut of 50%."
"There were those who wanted 100%, but we reached 50% as a good compromise because there are a range of people, particularly in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also elsewhere in this Parliament, who would like to see the commitment entered into by the Council fulfilled for the way in which we handle the common foreign and security policy between Parliament and Council."
"Equally, in terms of the special representatives, where we are recommending that the whole sum be transferred to the EU delegations, the point we are making on first reading is that we want to have, if not special treatment, at least clarity in the way in which these people are appointed."
"As the amendment says, we would like to adopt guidelines for the decision to establish, select and appoint EU special representatives and for the regular assessment of their work."
"Turning now to the second aspect, which is value for money, this is an innovative concept where what we want to do is to stop throwing good money after bad."
"I do not think there is anybody in this House who has opposed this particular kind of concept, which is involved in identifying those lines where we know from the different reports available to us that the policies are being implemented poorly, either quantitatively or qualitatively."
"Thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgets - though it would have been nice if the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control could have contributed more to this process - by looking at our own cost benefit analyses, at the Court of Auditors' reports, at the budget forecast alert and at the synthesis reports provided by the Commission, we have been able to identity a number of lines which we unanimously have voted into reserve at 30% on first reading in the Committee on Budgets."
"The intent is to be able to release these sums by the end of the year on second reading, so long as we can have a satisfactory explanation from the Commission on 15 November, when we will have a joint Committee on Budgets-Committee on Budgetary Control meeting to examine these lines and to see whether they are now operating positively."
"The whole idea behind this is that we can purge the budget of those lines which are operating ineffectively, and move towards what we are looking for, which is a positive statement of assurance."
"Where the Council has suggested that this might be against the Financial Regulation, I think Article 43(1)(b) makes it quite clear that where there are sufficient grounds for us to put monies in the reserve, then we are entitled to do so."
"It would be nice if, by the end of our process - maybe on the margins of our conciliation meeting with the Council on 21 November, or in our vote in December - we could come to a common statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on how we handle this concept of value for money on a regular basis, so that we can make it a part of our process, rather than something treated in an arbitrary manner."
"There are a few last comments on other aspects - budget control and value for money."
"The first of these is shared management: the problems about which we heard from the President of the Court of Auditors in the Budgetary Control Committee yesterday evening, when, much to my surprise and that of other colleagues, he said he was not particularly interested in shared management because the Council pays and it is the Commission that takes responsibility for signing off the budget."
"I do not think it is possible to have a statement of assurance unless the Member States sign up to their responsibilities under the budget for the funds that they pay, which amount to 75 or 80% of the budget."
"Therefore, shared management is something we think is important to have implementation of the IIA provision."
"Secondly, as regards work on the agency - which Mrs Haug has so ably coordinated for us - we are putting sums of money of the increases in reserves so that we can hear views from the agencies as to what they will be doing with their money and their work programmes in order to get value for money once again."
"Last but not least is the question on the administration, where the Council actions on first reading to effectively diminish the number of Commission posts by some 2000 in the next few years are something we have not been able to sign up to."
"We believe that we need a screening exercise of the Commission by 30 April 2007 so that we can understand what the mid-term demands of the Commission are before taking radical action to cut back."
"In addition to that, we would not only like a state of play from the Commission as to which of the outstanding regulations we could have withdrawn, but above all what we would like is to be sure that we have clarity between what we have here in the budget process and the legislative process of the work programme which is decided on by the Commission today; so that when we have a final decision on this budget, hopefully in December, and the resolution from Parliament on the legislative work programme, then both of these can be bound together and we can have the Commission President come to Parliament in February 2007 and tell us what the final work programme of the Union is."
"Otherwise it is unclear to citizens."
"Therefore, I would conclude by saying that this is a budget which in terms of priorities is what I would call a budget which is consistent and forward-looking; in value-for-money terms, it is a budget which can be said to be coherent and prudent; and lastly, that in taking these two building blocks together, we will be able to look forward to the review which will be coming by 2008/2009 and have a very clear position for the European Parliament in order to ensure that where we need increases in particular policies or different actions to be taken on policy matters, we will be well prepared for that debate."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (MT) The budgetary increase given to the other sections in 2007, when compared to that given in 2006, was only marginal and much less than that requested in the preliminary draft."
"The increase agreed upon reflects the rate of inflation and the amounts related to each institution's specific priorities."
"The Committee on Budgets decided to restore more than EUR 10 million out of the reductions of around EUR 29 million made by the Council to the other sections, excluding Parliament and the Council."
"The 2007 budget was based on the institutions' essential priorities, while ensuring their unhindered operational and functional efficiency."
"Globally, the increase for institutions amounts to EUR 31 million compared to the EUR 48 million requested."
"Over the years, Mr President, exaggerated margins have become common features of some institutions' estimates."
"This practice, or rather bad practice, brought with it an awkward system of last-minute transfers or the cancellation of certain appropriations."
"This situation will be difficult to manage when, in a few years' time, the property-acquisition process will start to decline."
"In this regard, we believe that an increasingly activity-based approach would be more effective."
"Moreover, the presentation of budget estimates should be more standardised, motivations should provide clearer justifications and estimates should be more accurate."
"With regard to Parliament, the Committee on Budgets agreed that the final amount of the 2007 budget should be of EUR 0.1397 billion, that is to say a margin of EUR 25 million below the maximum of 20%."
"This level corresponds to 19.65% of the administrative expenditure under Chapter V. In this regard, however, Parliament is not renouncing its traditional 20% share."
"In fact, the committee extends its support to the appropriation of unused funds for unexpected, but justified, expenses by means of 'amending budgets'."
"The creation of an efficient structure, together with the implementation of a redeployment exercise should be the main objectives in the strategic planning for the 2007 Establishment Plan."
"Moreover, the filling of vacancies resulting from retirement will not be considered an automatic process."
"With regard to support and services for Members, we agree with the Secretary-General that the main objectives relating to the 'raising the game' exercise were, broadly, achieved."
"However, there is a recurrent complaint that there is insufficient information about the support services available for MEPs."
"The administration should address this shortcoming and corrrect it by no later than the end of this year."
"Mr President, due to lack of time I am unable to to talk in detail about all the priorities addressed in the budget and in my report for 2007."
"These priorities relate to the EUR 48 million allocated for expenses connected with enlargment involving Bulgaria and Romania; the measures taken for the simplification and upgrading of legislation; the scrutiny of the cost-efficiency of translation services, especially with regard to the length of texts; the authorisation of EUR 9.5 million in supplemetary funds for the improvement of the visitors' programme; the decision to keep EUR 6.7 million in the reserve for Web TV, a final decision about which will be taken after a presentation of the prototype in CoBu; and the need for greater control of the administration of multinlingualism, for which we put EUR 3 million in reserve."
"The misuse of this service by some, including political parties, should attract sanctions."
"EUR 50 million have been reserved for buildings, and we must ensure that buildings policy is periodically reviewed."
"I must conclude by saying that budget implementation requires better management if objectives are to be achieved."
"There is also a need for annual reports based on more detailed information about the work carried out by the institutions."
"These reports should be used to justify requests for additional funds so that Parliament might arrive at a more rational decision about fund allocation."
"This way, budgets financed by European taxpayers will provide real added-value to their everday lives."
"Finally, I would like to thank all those who contributed towards the drawing up of this report."
"I would especially like to thank the Secretary General, who has handed in his resignation."
"We will miss him; whether he will miss us is another matter."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here at Parliament's debate on the 2007 budget."
"I can assure you that we will note with interest the issues raised during the discussion and pass them on to all our colleagues."
"The budget's drafting process is a long one."
"I appreciate the frank atmosphere of debate that has reigned all year long between Members of the Council and Parliament."
"We last discussed the issue at the budget trilogue on 18 October."
"I had an opportunity then to give a few tentative reactions to the draft amendments by the Committee on Budgets, to be voted on in plenary on Thursday."
"Before I present certain important matters to the Council, I would like to deal with certain issues of quality, which are of importance for the work of the Union as a whole."
"It is my intention now to speak frankly and call a spade a spade."
"I believe that the Committee on Budgets, under the leadership of Mr Elles and Mr Grech, has worked without bias, by also focusing on what can be accomplished using our citizens' and taxpayers' money."
"Hopefully, the Commission too will become involved in this work."
"The value for money from Union taxes must be made a regular process."
"The value for money concept must become something that pervades the entire budgetary procedure."
"In my opinion, the first reading of the budget should concentrate on facts and figures."
"I do not think that the budgetary authorities should make political statements at first reading."
"I said at the Council presentation of the draft budget on 5 September 2006 that the EU's budgetary procedure is in need of innovation."
"Without innovative budgetary solutions we cannot promote the Union's competitiveness or make the institutions' administration more efficient. The budgetary authorities must take concrete action to achieve their objectives in this 2007 budget."
"From the Council's viewpoint, Parliament's intention to increase payment appropriations significantly, when there is no proven need to do so, is not the right way to build a bridge between the EU and the general public."
"An increase on this scale would only result in an enormous surplus in the first year."
"The 2007 budget should be based on realistic and justified appropriation needs."
"Halving the common foreign and security policy budget is simply not acceptable."
"In the interinstitutional agreement concluded five months ago, Parliament approved an average sum of EUR 250 million per annum."
"That being the case, I believe that the EUR 159 million advocated by the Commission and the Council is a reasonable figure."
"I would therefore ask how Parliament's suggestion of EUR 73 million can be justified."
"I would hope that the plenary session will act responsibly with regard to these two whole areas."
"The budgetary authorities need to develop a procedure for the use of reserves in the very near future."
"Appropriations should not be set aside merely for tactical reasons."
"Here too, the provisions of the Financial Regulation must be complied with to the letter."
"As we all know well, the 2007 budget is the first to be covered by the new interinstitutional agreement."
"It is very important that all of its old familiar aspects, such as ceilings and adequate margins, are respected right from the start."
"The new agreement also has new provisions on, for example, pilot projects and preparatory operations."
"I would highlight the importance of these provisions, which clearly state that pilot projects and preparatory operations are not the exclusive right of one budgetary authority."
"Both Parliament and the Council must also respect this aspect of the content of the new interinstitutional agreement."
"The 2007 budget is a package."
"It is important that the budgetary authorities establish the jointly agreed package within the framework of the budgetary procedure."
"The crucial elements of the overall package are interlinked."
"Finally, I would like to return to the revision of the Financial Regulation."
"This is a subject that Parliament and the Commission have been anxious about, and they have been urging the Council to make haste."
"President Borrel last raised the matter in his discussions with Prime Minister Vanhanen on 17 October."
"It is with pleasure that I can now state that the Council adopted a common position on the revision of the Financial Regulation on 19 October."
"We can therefore hold negotiations with Parliament on the Financial Regulation on 21 November."
"I am sorry that we have not been able to keep to the timetable proposed by the Commissioner responsible for the budget in her letter in June."
"The Commission had hoped that the meeting would be held last week."
"I believe, however, that the timetable that I have referred to will give everyone sufficient time to formulate a comprehensive overall solution."
"I hope that these brief comments of mine have done something to clarify the Council's opinions."
"I earnestly believe that Parliament and the Council can reach a good common solution on the budget for 2007 in the discussions in the weeks ahead."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to express the Commission's appreciation for the work that was done by the Committee on Budgets and its rapporteur, tackling more than 1200 proposals from other committees in the process of the preparations for first reading."
"We know what that means and how it was done."
"In general, the Commission has had a positive reaction to the proposal that has been placed on the table by Parliament for tomorrow's vote."
"However, I should like to mention three sensitive points, which we would like to solve, together with Parliament, before second reading."
"The first point is about the horizontal reserves on 30% of budget lines on value-added programmes."
"We are a bit concerned about the first application of the programme - not as a political idea, which we supported from the very beginning, but the first application of it on the amount in general and some conditionalities that are coming together."
"However, the Commission and its secretariat are ready to come in the middle of November for the hearings, to which Parliament has invited us, to explain as much as we can, to allow Parliament to lift as much as it will be able to before the second reading."
"The second element is on agencies, especially three new ones."
"They are supposed to come into being in 2007."
"The Committee on Budgets was removing preparations for them."
"We understand that it concerns point 47 in our new interinstitutional agreement."
"The relationship between two budgetary authorities needs to be clarified and the new procedures defined -that is why we will in the near future be asking for technical meetings between the three institutions to clarify the situation in order to allow those three agencies to come into being as of January 2007."
"The third element is a reserve of EUR 50 million on Commission staff salaries in heading 5."
"We would like to thank Parliament for restoring the cuts which have been performed by the Council, but reserves are still of concern to us because conditionalities are wide and there are a lot of them."
"But as I said in the beginning, we will strive to make as much information as possible available before 15 November and before the final conciliation with both arms of the budgetary authority, so as to be able to lift as much as we can."
"If a reserve is not lifted at least partially from 1 January, we are not able to start recruitment at all for anybody, including from new Member States and the replacement of retired staff."
"In general we are positive."
"We are ready to work closely with Parliament on lifting and fulfilling all conditions provided at first reading as a proposal for us."
"We hope that by 21 November we will be able to come to an agreement that will be good for all three institutions and acceptable."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (HU) The foreign affairs chapter was perhaps the greatest loser in the seven-year budget, which immediately calls into question whether the European Union will be capable of fulfilling its role as a global player."
"It is especially unfortunate that in the annual budget process, the Council has made even further significant cuts to its foreign affairs budget."
"It was for this reason that the Committee on Foreign Affairs decided to restore the preliminary draft budget on numerous points, and thus to allocate the original amounts."
"We set up the European Parliament's foreign affairs priorities as that we deemed it necessary to devote more resources to the candidate countries and potential candidate countries, to spend more on those countries on the eastern side of our European Neighbourhood Policy, and to provide more humanitarian aid to Palestine."
"The Committee on Budgets did not agree with all of our proposals, and therefore we are submitting these proposals once again on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"In the interest of a responsible and consistent foreign policy, we call on you to accept the proposal of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DE) Mr President, perhaps I might be permitted to start by congratulating my colleague Mr Elles on his strategic thinking, particularly with regard to China and India."
"This is a new thing and something we should take very seriously."
"We in the Committee on Development have managed to get the funds from the preliminary draft budget reinstated, to keep the budget transparent, and to produce a report that is already in line with our colleague Mr Mitchell's on development cooperation instruments, but I have nevertheless tabled two amendments in the plenary, which were not, however, adopted by the Committee on Budgets."
"One of these was Amendment 250, which was intended to set up a pilot project for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, which were, I would remind the House, the subject of a report we adopted earlier this year."
"If we want to build up the self-employed and small business sector in developing countries, we need to give SMEs an enhanced role."
"It really would be vexatious if we were to fail to put in place a pilot project that underlined our own call for stronger SMEs in developing countries."
"The other amendment to which I referred was Amendment 253, which has to do with exchanges with other parliaments."
"It refers to our own House's Budget and to the possibility of maintaining links with other legislatures, such as the Pan-African Parliament or the Parliament of Afghanistan, which would enable this House to have a real and positive influence on the democratisation process around the world, and so I urge you, on Thursday, to vote to adopt this amendment too."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (LT) The budget is essential in implementing projects that are important and beneficial to the Community and its citizens."
"One such project is the Globalisation Adjustment Fund of EUR 500 million."
"I suggested assigning the funds to the reserve of the following year's budget of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We will vote on this in December."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to draw your attention, and especially the attention of the Commission, to the rules established for the use of the funds."
"The question is whether the money will actually reach a particular unemployed person?"
"The money cannot be misappropriated as it had often been the case with donor aid to undertakings in the process of restructuring."
"I foresee a considerable risk of misusing the Commission's funds."
"It is against this that we, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, have voted."
"We cannot accept the rules unless they are substantially amended."
"I therefore call upon you to take a firm stand and demand that the Commission guarantee the transparent and effective use of funds."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the start of the first financial year of the Financial Perspective that we negotiated in April and adopted in May is almost upon us; the financial framework is a tight one, and presents us with a number of problems as regards the achievement of our policy objectives."
"The Commission took a very cautious approach to drawing up the preliminary draft budget for 2007, and the Council - as always unperturbed by what the experts might say - cut it even further down to size."
"The Committee on the Environment tried to save what could be saved by reinstating the figures from the preliminary draft budget and making responsible increases in a few lines."
"The Committee on Budgets took on board all the Committee on the Environment's amendments, and for that I am very grateful to my fellow-Members who sit on it."
"We cannot, however, regard the overall situation as satisfactory, since the financial year 2007 will present us with as yet unresolved problems with LIFE+ and the action programme on health."
"Agencies are the only area in which we can look forward to the future with optimism on the grounds that they are being properly developed and funded, and by that I mean not only those agencies for which the Committee on the Environment is the competent specialised committee, but all of them, cooperation with which has undergone a marked improvement over the last two years; indeed, the personnel and personnel development plans for them will be in our hands by the end of the year, and I take a positive view of all of them."
"It has to be said, though, that there are persistent difficulties with the new ones - the Gender Institute, the Human Rights Agency, and the Chemicals Agency - and, contrary to what the Commissioner has just said, these are not of a merely technical nature, for there is as yet no legal basis for any of them."
"We in this House are still waiting for the start of negotiations with the Council pursuant to Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement - negotiations, that is, on where the money for the three new agencies is to come from."
"Perhaps the Presidency of the Council might be so good as to move this process along a bit."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I should like to make three points."
"Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteur for increasing payment appropriations for priority programmes linked to the Lisbon Agenda, like the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"These are key initiatives that not only provide work for Europe's valuable and highly skilled scientists but also prepare the EU to face future challenges as a global leader."
"We should not overlook the significant and positive impact that they have on our regions and their populations."
"Secondly, I commend this report for the concern it expresses for the Galileo Programme, which has been under-funded in the 2007 draft general budget."
"This showcase EU programme is a major technological, economic and political challenge and we really need to be sure about it."
"I do not understand why we are prepared to cut funding in this area."
"It would be an embarrassment for the EU if this project were to stall or fail due to lack of financial backing."
"Thirdly, since many areas, such as the ones I have just mentioned, require increased funding, I do not understand why, when the ITRE Committee's request is for a smaller budget, this does not come from the Security and Space Research programme, where we should reduce payments and not increase them."
"Turning to more general non-ITRE issues, on the structural funds I support the call in this report for an increase in payments."
"This is the one area where ordinary citizens see the difference EU policies make to their everyday lives."
"My own region, the West Midlands, is a case in point."
"EU funds have acted as a catalyst in re-energising the potential and development of local communities."
"On external affairs, Asia is one of the largest and most populous regions in the world."
"It contains 60% of the world's population."
"So I am amazed that the Commission has cut funding."
"Last year money for the tsunami disaster was taken from other Asian programmes without any increase and this year, because the tsunami funding has decreased, the Commission has cut the funding again."
"Has the Commission forgotten that the money is desperately needed by the Asian programmes which were sacrificed, where the EU is committed to meeting Millennium Development Goals?"
"I ask the Commission to justify this."
"I welcome this report's call for transparency in the allocation of funding for information and communication."
"We need full transparency across the board, so EU taxpayers' money spent on EU policies should be totally traceable and published on the Internet."
"Then we can see exactly how much money goes to whom."
"This applies equally to the Members of this House and especially to agriculture."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate both the rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, on producing excellent reports."
"I thank them for their hard work."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President: one minute, two points."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has quite simply voted for the maintenance of the Commission's proposed spending on consumer protection, not the deep cuts proposed by the Council."
"So we are voting for the status quo as proposed by the Commission."
"Secondly, I should like to mention Parliament's budget for communicating with our citizens."
"Each year American congressmen are allowed to send four four-sided newspapers to every single one of their voters to tell them of their glorious achievements."
"I propose an amendment that would allow each of us here to send one free four-sided newspaper to each of our voters every year to tell them what we are doing."
"I hope colleagues will support the amendment, which would help make up the communication deficit."
"We have a few voters here in the visitors' gallery, but there are millions out there who do not know what we are doing and we need to communicate with them."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the financial perspective, the amount for the trans-European networks - the 30 top-priority transport projects - has been cut back to a third of the amount that the Commission originally found necessary."
"We still do not have the legal basis for the funding in order. Nor do we know how the reduced amount is to be distributed over the next few years."
"We have therefore chosen to put the whole of the amount for 2007 - almost EUR 800 million - into reserves until everything has been clarified."
"We cannot, of course, make use of the first year's budget without having a clear idea of what is to happen over the next few years."
"You do not build half a bridge. It is a question of 'either/or'."
"In the case of the three agencies for maritime, aviation and railway safety, we want to see the Commission's figures reinstated in the budget."
"These are new agencies in the course of being set up, and they need space in which to work."
"Last but not least, I would draw attention to the pilot project for safe lay-bys along European motorways."
"With more stringent rules governing drivers' rest and driving periods, it is important for European drivers to have proper and safe conditions in which to rest."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Mr President, I should like to say 'well done' to the rapporteur: he has certainly shown a steady hand."
"On an overall level, payments in the 2007 budget must reach 1.04% of EU GNI if we are to deliver effective programmes to our citizens."
"It is also crucial that we adopt a qualitative, value-for-money approach with the resources that we have."
"Somebody made the comment that the Council pays."
"In fact, it does not."
"The citizens pay."
"We are dealing with taxpayers' money; they have entrusted their money to us and they rightly expect to see positive results within the context of overall value for money."
"As rapporteur on the REGI Committee, I strongly urge that the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget be restored and that cohesion be considered one of the policy priorities of the EU."
"Finally, I call on the Commission to clarify the legal base of the peace programme and enable resources to be allocated to the International Fund for Ireland."
"As an Irish MEP, I am pleased to have the opportunity to thank the EU for its continuing support for peace and IFI funding."
"Well in excess of EUR 1 billion has been given to promote peace-building, understanding and tolerance."
"You have supported communities and shown faith with ordinary people in the border regions of Ireland."
"You have played your role and you can take credit for that."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Elles, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, all the amendments by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been accepted by the Committee on Budgets."
"First of all, I am delighted that the amendments concerning the restoration of the Preliminary Draft Budget have been adopted, and I am even more delighted that the amendments concerning the increase in aid to the poorest people have been adopted: food aid, refunds for milk, free distribution of fruit and vegetables, promotion activities, the distribution of milk to schoolchildren and aid for bee-keeping."
"We should have liked more account to have been taken of, in particular, suckler-cow premiums - vital in disadvantaged areas - aid for energy crops and pilot projects on energy efficiency."
"We shall take the liberty of re-tabling amendments along those lines in plenary."
"Overall, we consider that the Committee on Budgets has been attentive beyond our expectations to the amendments that we were proposing, and we would thank you, Mr President, Mr Elles, ladies and gentlemen, for the constructive spirit in which your decisions were taken."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (ES) Mr President, our committee has drawn up certain observations with regard to the cuts introduced by the Council in relation to the European Commission's proposals."
"The most significant of these cuts is the EUR 10 million cut in the reserve in international agreements, which is being taken away - is disappearing - both for commitments and for payments."
"The Committee on Fisheries believes that this could even create problems with regard to the Union's legal obligations in this field, and we are therefore calling for the initial sums to be restored."
"The Council's other reductions relate to the payments of the European Fisheries Fund: EUR 23 million for the convergence regions and EUR 7 million for those that are not included in this category."
"The Committee on Fisheries believes that these cuts would make it impossible to pay the advance of 7%, as stipulated in the Fund's own Regulation."
"Ladies and gentleman, the general contribution allocated to fisheries is already modest enough, and we therefore find these cuts unacceptable."
"As well as being arbitrary and unjustified, they send a very negative message at a critical time for the sector, and we in the Committee on Fisheries are therefore asking for the figures proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget to be restored."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, believe in principle that we should go after value for money, for the effective and economic use of funds is what matters."
"On the other hand, though - and this is where we have different ends in mind - Europe needs money if we are to be able to enthuse people and move the European project forward, which is what we want to do, and that will not be possible unless proper funding is made available."
"Let me remind the House of this morning's debates on the culture programme and on Europe's culture policy, and of the debates we are going to have this evening on lifelong learning, on youth policy over the coming years and on 'Europe for the Citizens'."
"This morning, it was lamented - as it will be this evening too - that we do not spend enough money in this field, in an area that really does have an impact on people, on Europe's citizens, and builds a link between them and Europe."
"We share together the great problem of how we get people not only to accept Europe, but also to be enthusiastic about it, and that is why, far from cutting back on these programmes, we should be investing more in Europe's future."
"That is also why the Committee on Culture and Education has been highly consistent in rejecting the cuts the Council wanted to make to these programmes."
"Mr President, Mrs Wideroos, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I want first of all to say a well-deserved thank you to the general rapporteur, our fellow Member and friend Mr Elles, as well as to the Committee on Budgets as a whole, for the way in which it has taken account of the priorities of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Among these priorities, there are two that obviously deserved a very special effort when it came to the budget."
"The first priority was better control of the EU's external borders, which are now subject to permanent and considerable migratory pressures, with the whole of the southern border under particular pressure."
"Anyone who needs convincing of this need only watch television and read the newspapers every day."
"In this connection, it was essential to strengthen the operational resources of the FRONTEX Agency, which we established for the purposes of external border control."
"Happily, the Agency's resources were, indeed, strengthened, with the support, in particular, of our general rapporteur and Spanish fellow Members who helped us correct - I do not know, Mrs Wideroos, whether to use the word 'stupidity' or 'incoherence'; I shall opt for 'stupidity' - the stupidity of the Council, which had, for its part, reduced the resources of the FRONTEX Agency in spite of current circumstances."
"We had a second priority, this too recognised by the whole of Parliament and enthusiastically supported by Europeans, if all the available polls are to be believed, which was to increase the resources earmarked for the fight against terrorism and organised crime which, as you well know, make a mockery of the EU's internal borders."
"On this subject too, our message has been heard by the Committee on Budgets which has, in particular, increased the resources set aside for Eurojust."
"These too had been reduced in the Council's draft budget."
"Mrs Wideroos, I shall leave it to you to choose a suitable adverb to characterise this reduction."
"I make no bones about the fact that, where the 'freedom, security and justice' sector is concerned, the Council is equal neither to what is at stake nor to Europeans' expectations, and our Parliament will be able to take pride in using its vote to correct the inconsistencies in the position of the Council, whose members delight in making all the right noises but balk at acting together to confront serious problems they have in common."
"It is a terrible shame."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, it is often said that knowledge does not take up any space, but in this case I believe that the debate and the reflection on the future of Europe should have a space in the budget."
"When we met with the general rapporteur in July, I told him, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that this may appear to be the least important thing in this debate, but that in reality that was not the case."
"We are debating the way we want Europe to be in the future and, in order to realise our dreams, we need funds and resources, above all so that we can inform the citizens, strengthen the institutions responsible for relations between civil society and the European institutions and promote the debate."
"Are we going to achieve that with the budget we have?"
"The amendments presented by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have been taken up to a certain extent by the Committee on Budgets."
"In that way we will be able to promote proper reflection on these matters and also ensure that the citizens understand some - if just a little - of this debate that we are holding here and know what the Union's budget is."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, I should like thank my colleagues, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who have done considerable work on the EU budget for 2007."
"In general, although I support the approach of our rapporteurs, in the final analysis we must guarantee sufficient funding for common foreign and security policy and we must find a solution to the funding of the agencies."
"However, the ongoing negotiations can only be based on a mutual understanding that all sides abide by their earlier commitments."
"I address this to the Council in particular, which has repeatedly proposed extensive budget cuts in areas of great importance to the European Parliament."
"On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to raise a few points that unfortunately have to be raised every year."
"The principle of gender mainstreaming is enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, which requires a gender equality perspective not only to be applied to measures designed specifically to promote equal opportunities, but also to be incorporated into all policies at all levels of the budgetary process by means of gender budgeting."
"Since 2003, when this House adopted a resolution on gender budgeting - that is, building public budgets from a gender perspective - the fact that public budgets, including the EU budget, are not gender-neutral and have a different impact on women and men has been taken into account."
"A gender budgeting approach should be used to assess and restructure all pertinent budget programmes, measures and policies, as well as to determine to what extent resources are allocated in gender-equal or -unequal ways and ultimately achieve gender neutrality, where equal consideration is given regardless of gender."
"When the Finnish Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Tuula Haatainen, addressed our committee in early October, she highlighted the mainstreaming of equality policies in budgetary planning and evoked the Finnish example of seeking to ensure that all items, not only in the national, but also in the EU budget, take gender equality policies into account."
"I certainly hope that the Finnish Presidency will succeed in this respect."
"draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - (HU) I wish to speak on behalf of the Committee on Petitions about the budget for the European Ombudsman."
"We often speak of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, of helping the citizens to gain a better understanding of what the European Union really is."
"The office of the European Ombudsman is a small institution, one that does a considerable amount of work in this area."
"It is therefore very important for the Ombudsman to have sufficient budgetary resources available to be able to perform his duties successfully and effectively."
"In April of this year, we spoke very positively about the European Ombudsman during the discharge process."
"I would like to remind everyone that we spoke of this office as a model (for other institutions, with clearly defined competencies) and a well-administered budget."
"The European Ombudsman is sparing with translation charges and does not wish to add new items, and it is precisely for this reason that, on behalf of my committee, I request that, because we have to take account of the forthcoming enlargement, we support a moderate increase in the budget requested by the European Ombudsman, while emphasising the need for budgetary discipline and for citizens to be provided high levels of services."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Grech, the rapporteur for Parliament's budget."
"It was a pleasure to work with him and to reach joint compromises in my role as shadow rapporteur."
"I congratulate him on the excellent end result that we achieved."
"Above all, we have to remember the principles upon which the budget is drawn up."
"Firstly, we have to be precise about how we intend to spend taxpayers' money."
"Another principle is that we spend money on what is necessary."
"We should not be doing all sorts of nice and interesting things, but what is really necessary."
"The 20% increase principle is hopelessly outdated."
"It sometimes leads to madness, such as the proposal for Internet television."
"The idea behind Internet television is for Parliament to have its own TV channel."
"The money for that cannot really be justified to taxpayers."
"As an example, I might mention the speech given in Brussels by Finland's second Minister of Finance at the beginning of the Finnish presidential term."
"The speech was broadcast via Internet TV to everyone in Europe, but in the whole of Europe there were just 14 interested viewers, half of whom were the Minister's own advisers."
"If we are to make an investment of tens of millions for just a handful of people, the money is certainly going to be in the wrong place."
"It would be more cost-effective to spend the money, for example, on bringing journalists from small local and regional newspapers here, after which they would write articles on Parliament and what happens here."
"People read these sorts of newspapers carefully, but they will not really follow these Internet TV broadcasts."
"We need all budget headings to be closely evaluated and monitored, and this applies especially to building policy."
"I am happy that we have found a common view, because the building in Strasbourg became a scandal, and we no longer need publicity like that."
"We therefore need to be a lot more careful about how we spend money."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs Wideroos, Mrs Grybauskaitė, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank our two rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who, through the work they have done and the tenacity they have shown, have been able to give direction to our work on this first reading of the budget."
"This budget, the first of the 2007-2013 programme, is a very modest one, representing only 1.04% of GDP."
"Not only is it very modest, but it is probably not up to the challenges facing the European Union: the energy crisis, the crisis of confidence, world conflicts and the increase in poverty and job insecurity, all coming at a time when Europeans are expressing ever more expectations of the European Union."
"The restricted framework forces very modest ambitions on us."
"Quality, and not just quantity, characterises the approach to this 2007 budget, therefore."
"The budget has also compelled us to adopt a hybrid strategy."
"Indeed, not only are our legal bases for the new policies not ready, but we are not ready, either, to champion and implement all the policies wished for by Europeans."
"We want to be ambitious, as people expect us to be, but we must also be realistic, as we do not know whether we shall be able to implement these policies."
"For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the minimum consisted in reinstating the preliminary draft budget for all the policies to which we are attached and, in particular, for the Lisbon objectives and the Gothenburg policies, not forgetting employment, solidarity, the environment and rural development."
"2007 should be the year in which our communication policy is overhauled, given that Europeans have been very much forgotten up until now."
"Where external policy is concerned, I would also appeal for us to adopt a balanced approach to administration, particularly where the EU's borders are concerned, as we cannot be satisfied with a unilateral approach that concentrates on law and order."
"I should like, if I may, to emphasise two important points: first of all, the role to be played under the heading of the EU budget by cofinancing involving the European Investment Bank, and this with a view to relaunching the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; and, secondly, the role of pilot projects and preparatory actions, which have always favoured the birth of new ideas and which should be implemented."
"In reality, I am mostly concerned about the implementation of this budget."
"Our rapporteur has opted for spending with a qualitative focus. This amounts to championing the way in which our priorities have traditionally been financed, but it also constitutes an appeal to the Commission to respect fully the political choices made by Parliament."
"If, moreover, Parliament can make criticisms of the way in which policies are administered by the other institutions, it is because such criticism is authorised by the Treaty, the institutional agreements and actual practice."
"Parliament is one of the branches of the budgetary authority, and we do not wish to be dispossessed of our power as a result of abandoning all authority regarding the way in which our votes are brought into play."
"Is it fair, however, for us, in the name of that power, to make it more difficult for these same institutions to exercise their prerogatives?"
"No."
"It would be dangerous, and even counter-productive, to try to intervene too much in administrative practice."
"I would also say to the Council that the Commission could not do better if, at the same time, we were to agree to freeze recruitment by that institution."
"However, we have little room for manoeuvre if - as we have cause to fear, given the latest line proposed - all our priorities are adjusted in accordance with the European Commission's shortcomings in implementing policy."
"Finally, and in conclusion, I wanted to tell you, Mr President, that the Council must remember that it cannot impose its point of view, because we need together to comply with the priorities of the European political project and because, if we reduce the budget by too much, we shall no longer be able to develop any of these policies of which Europeans expect so much."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the budget we are presenting today is a responsible and sensible budget."
"We have not accepted the Council's indiscriminate cuts to administrative expenditure but we have, on the other hand, put EUR 50 million from the Commission's administrative budget into the reserves and demanded a clearer explanation of trends in certain areas of expenditure."
"We must not close our eyes to the facts when we establish the budget, but go into details and ensure that precisely those resources that are necessary are available."
"In that connection, I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Elles, for the approach he has chosen to adopt in this year's work on the budget."
"I am thinking of the idea of 'value for money', following on from criticism by the Court of Auditors and in cost-benefit studies and other reports."
"In particular, I would draw attention to the cost-benefit studies as a constructive innovation, offering us a far better survey of, for example, trends in the Commission's information and communication policy and the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"Specifically on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would emphasise the need for adequate resources for the legal and asylum policy and for the foreign policy."
"There is a sharp contrast between the fine words uttered by EU Heads of Government in formal speeches and the resources that their finance ministers are prepared to make available."
"At the same time as Heads of Government emphasise that the EU should present a united front in refugee policy and strengthen the common border management agency, FRONTEX, finance ministers make a point of cutting back on appropriations to the agency."
"Clearly, this is inconsistent."
"I am pleased, moreover, that we have had to reach agreement to sort these matters out."
"In connection with the financial perspective, it is quite clear that the EU's foreign policy was badly handled."
"That the budget we are presenting today is clearly a responsible one is shown, however, by the fact that Parliament has not tried to challenge the interinstitutional agreement."
"We have established a budget within the framework of the agreement."
"Foreign policy is an area that will demand close attention over the next few years, however."
"I think that, especially in regard to our close neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe, we in the EU have an obligation to promote stronger economic development and to encourage a view of democratic development as something hopeful and positive."
"The money needs to be used well, and we therefore ask that the Commission ensure that the new programmes take account of the Court of Auditors' criticism of the aid to Russia."
"With regard to Parliament's and other institutions' budget, my group has adopted the approach of our rapporteur, Mr Grech, whom I should also like to thank for a constructive and substantial piece of work."
"It means that the budget is somewhat below the level originally announced by the institutions but, after thorough analysis of each individual institution, a position has been adopted on what is in reality needed and a suitable margin thus created."
"We have had a number of debates about whether Parliament needs 20% of the total administrative expenditure, and we have ended up with a figure that is rather on the small side."
"My group supports the policy of recent years to the effect that Parliament should purchase the buildings it uses, but we must ensure that we have a clearer overall view of what resources are needed for buildings over the next few years."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House's budget debates may well not be renowned for being sexy, but they are very important, for we, in the 2007 budget as in all the others, are setting out the priorities for our work over the coming year."
"You will be aware that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not vote to approve the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective on the grounds that we see this financial plan as resolving too few problems."
"We take the same view of the 2007 budget, and ask ourselves whether it will enable us to do those things that have to be done."
"For example, we do not agree with our agricultural policy or with the excessive subsidies paid out for agricultural exports."
"Our deep-frozen chickens sell in African markets for half the price of those that the Africans produce themselves, and then we end up complaining about how we get too many refugees from Africa, when it is we ourselves, with our own agricultural policy, who are helping to create the problem."
"There is also fisheries policy, where our fishing quotas are still too high, and we are endangering our fish stocks."
"This is another policy that the European Union should change."
"Not to mention our policy on tobacco, for we are still subsidising tobacco growers while at the same time banning tobacco advertisements."
"That, too, strikes me as inconsistent and not a smart policy for Europe to adopt."
"Now that many European countries have the globalisation blues - remember the referendum in France? - our globalisation policy ought to be a more just one, with us speaking out more emphatically in favour of fair trade and getting more serious about our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, in which respect we are lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to funding the war on poverty."
"Europe, though, must also do more towards a forward-looking energy policy; we need to invest more in research into renewable energies that would make us less dependent on Mr Putin and enable us to be more forthright in our criticisms of his autocratic regime."
"What do we have to do instead?"
"We have to invest more in education, research, culture, the media and in the cultural industry, which is an important pillar of the Lisbon Strategy, and that would enable us to make that strategy more precise and more forward-looking."
"What we in Europe need is to be more of one mind where policy is concerned; that is the only way in which we will develop a responsible common foreign policy that is pro-active, that spreads civilisation, that reinforces civil society through the neighbourhood policy, but also intervenes when absolutely necessary."
"If that is what we want, we are not spending enough money."
"Much as I would love to see us take 'value for money' as our yardstick, we also have to work on the basis of 'good money for Europe'."
"If each of our Member States is spending only one per cent of its gross national income on Europe, then not enough money is being made available for European policies that are both important and the right ones to pursue."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I was going to say Madam Minister, but I will not."
"The reading contains a kind of virtual version of the EU budget."
"After the Council's reading, the level of payment appropriations was 1% of the Member States' combined GNP."
"Parliament in its first reading is raising this to 1.04%."
"This is being done by increasing appropriations for the draft budget, which could be called virtual because Parliament has not been in the habit of holding on to its increases right to the last."
"The Council has regularly been the winner in negotiations."
"Parliament's credibility will suffer if that happens again."
"Our group demands that Parliament keep to its priorities."
"The rapporteur, James Elles, has been innovative in looking for appropriations where the Commission has not implemented the budgetary requirements of previous years."
"We support his approach, where some funds are set aside in reserves and only released after the proper statements have been produced."
"Our group supports the right of the new Member States to seek staff positions in the Commission for their own citizens."
"Consequently, we cannot support the cuts in Commission personnel as proposed by the Council."
"Public authorities, including the European Union, may act as catalysts in various economic processes."
"On the other hand, the same money may also be spent on administrative projects led by Eurocrats, which in fact erode people's confidence in the Union."
"An example has been the PRINCE programme."
"Another will be the 3DGENOME project, plan D. There is a danger that Parliament's own Internet television channel will be another."
"Our group does not support the use of Commission and Parliament appropriations to produce Euro-propaganda, and we do not want the militarisation of the EU using money for the common foreign and security policy."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to begin by congratulating both rapporteurs and thanking them for all their work."
"This year, we are faced with a rather curious situation."
"The meagre Commission budget was cut only slightly by the Council, whereas Parliament's Committee on Budgets is proposing an increase in spending and financial commitments above the limits proposed by the Commission."
"This stance is obviously worth supporting, as the Union cannot rise to the challenges it faces without a larger budget."
"I refer to the forthcoming enlargement and increasing competition at world level."
"We can but hope that a suitable compromise will be reached in November and that the European budget will be closer to Parliament's proposal than to the Council's."
"Given that the Council wishes to cut expenditure, as it is wont to do, it was entirely appropriate for Mr Elles to suggest a value for money approach."
"This method involves working more efficiently to attain our aims."
"Bearing in mind that the 2007 budget is the first budget within the new financial framework, it is to be hoped that it will augur well for subsequent years."
"I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate my appeal to all those who care about human rights to support the amendments tabled by the UEN, in which we call for an end to Union financial support for programmes promoting compulsory abortion in third countries."
"Allow me to stress that the issue at stake here is compulsory abortion, not abortion as such."
"Rejection of these amendments will amount to supporting practices that infringe fundamental human rights."
"It will reveal the hypocrisy of all those who constantly advocate human rights whilst simultaneously trampling all over them."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, I must begin by thanking the rapporteurs."
"Nonetheless, the 2007 budget is a bad one."
"Most Members are aware of this, but only a small minority venture to say so openly."
"It is a bad budget because it fails to deal with, or even to tackle, any of the European Union's major problems."
"These include the sluggish economy and the increasing differences between the levels of development in the countries of the old and the new Union."
"The 2007 budget is also bad because it does not respond to the new challenges facing society and the economies of the Member States."
"There is the destabilisation of the market for raw materials, and in particular the steep increase in the price of sources of energy."
"There is also the important issue of economic migration from the new Member States to the countries of the old Union and the consequent rapidly rising social and economic costs in the poor countries."
"If the amendments tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group had been adopted, the 2007 budget could have served to introduce a new approach to funding for the agricultural sector."
"In view of the strong resistance to these amendments expressed at meetings of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, we expect them to be rejected by Parliament."
"This is a testament to the power of agribusiness and the large landowners."
"It also reveals where Parliament's true allegiance lies, as the House is quite prepared to defend the interests of a rich minority against the large majority of farmers who are poor."
"It should be pointed out that the resources saved could be devoted to supporting entrepreneurship, research and development and investment in infrastructure."
"The 2007 budget increases expenditure on administration, and provides for the creation of new offices and agencies."
"We are strongly opposed to all that."
"In conclusion, the IND/DEM Group will vote against the 2007 budget and we trust that other Members of the House will do likewise."
"- (SK) On the liabilities side, the draft budget of the European Union submitted by the European Council is fully consistent with the ratio parameters of the approved long-term financial perspective for 2007 - 2013."
"Appropriations for competitiveness and cohesion have increased significantly in the area of growth and employment as well as in the area of freedom, security, justice, civil society and the status of the European Union as a global partner."
"In compliance with the financial perspective, the share of spending on direct payments in agriculture has decreased; by contrast, the share of spending on rural development has grown."
"Unfortunately, as a result of the Council's efforts to significantly reduce the overall volume of funding, the positive trend in respect of payments has to a large extent dwindled away."
"The Council's reservations concerning the beneficiaries' ability to draw down budgeted expenses have had some negative implications."
"As the Council holds the key to the successful use of funds, I see this as the Council's reservations towards itself."
"However, Parliament's conviction that the available funds will be used well and efficiently exceeds the Council's expectations."
"Therefore, I will vote in favour of those amendments that bring payment parameters more in line with the long-term financial perspective."
"(PL) Mr President, at this crucial stage of work on the 2007 budget, it seems to me that the European Parliament is taking more account than the Council of the priorities, figures and principles of interinstitutional cooperation agreed for the period of the 2007-2013 multiannual Financial Perspective."
"As people elected by the people, we have a good understanding of the concern felt in the Member States."
"There is concern that the new generation of multiannual programmes might not begin on time."
"That will be one of the main criteria against which the year 2007 will be assessed."
"We also share a common desire for a new financial regulation, hence our pressure on the Finnish Presidency to ensure that we can work on the basis of the new financial regulation in 2007."
"The oft-repeated refrain that we are striving to rationalise the budget will become more than mere words this year."
"Mr Elles, our rapporteur, has proposed, and obtained Parliament's support for, a very consistent position."
"This entails giving strong financial support to the priority lines, whilst applying a 30% reserve to budget lines that seem unlikely to be used in full."
"We should all sing from the same hymn sheet in this matter."
"There is certain to be a difference of opinion, however, on the issue of posts and salaries in administration."
"We believe that the European Union's new functions require motivation, a stable administrative staff and recruitment from the new Member States."
"There is bound to be disagreement amongst us on this issue during the conciliation procedure in November."
"Personally, I am not fully satisfied with the geographical focus, as our main commitment is to the continent of Europe."
"The larger the European Union, the greater its responsibility for Europe."
"This should be reflected in the geographical focus applied to the distribution of funds."
"Nonetheless, the margins are retained and the flexibility instrument remains unused."
"It should also be possible to reach a compromise this year, and our argument should be the strength of Thursday's vote in the European Parliament."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, and I welcome the Commissioner and all of my fellow Members."
"I should like to make two very brief remarks."
"The first relates to what was said by Mrs Guy-Quint."
"Those who wanted proof of the inadequacy of the 2007-2013 financial perspective now have it."
"The first budget of the new financial framework clearly demonstrates that the funds are overstretched."
"The rapporteur has made some leaps of faith, some of which have been rightly corrected by the political groups, but nothing has been able to address the tight constraints of the multiannual financial framework."
"After this first piece of evidence it should be obvious, even to those who argue that 1% of gross national income is enough to sustain the Community budget, that what is instead required is a change, a mid-term review."
"I therefore call on Parliament to start preparing for this challenge right now."
"My second remark will be brief."
"Mr Elles has done well to propose an operation for controlling spending, which has our support and backing."
"It is right to be as transparent as possible, but it is also right not to undermine the fundamental policies of the European Union."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to thank the general rapporteur on the budget, Mr Elles, for his excellent preparatory work."
"He has demonstrated intimate knowledge of the work of the EU and the administration of its funds."
"His approach has been well-argued and bold."
"At the same time I want to thank Mr Grech for the excellent and responsible job that he has done, and Mr Lewandowski for his skilful leadership of the Committee on Budgets."
"The 2007 budget is the first to be drafted within the framework of the new financial perspectives."
"It is, moreover, an initial source of financing for new programmes and a final one for old commitments."
"The draft budget is moderate."
"It remains within the framework of the financial perspectives, and it does not even propose the use of the flexibility instrument."
"Nevertheless, it has clear priorities."
"In my opinion, it is quite right that appropriations for training, research and development have been increased."
"We must build more than just a pile of paper round the Lisbon Strategy."
"For that reason, we still need to make it easier for enterprise to flourish, which will mean competitiveness under the CIP Programme and a clear boost for innovation."
"All these have been among our group's objectives."
"The Northern Dimension and cooperation in the Baltic Sea region have been on the agenda for a long time, and it has been considered important to develop them."
"My group has tabled two draft amendments, Amendments 492 and 493, in which there is an addition to the explanatory statement for the budget headings on pan-European road and gas networks, which states that funds could also be used for financing projects which implement the strategies referred to."
"I hope that there is support for these draft amendments."
"(FR) Mr President, I shall concentrate on the European Parliament's budget."
"The Grech report is the definitive word on the European Parliament's budget, and I should like sincerely to thank Mr Grech for the quality of his work and, especially, for the climate of dialogue that he has been able to create."
"For the period of a year - and a year is a long time - he will have to administer all the releases of funds, as well as the reserves. Make no mistake: we shall have someone open, coherent and fair to engage with."
"For the second time in its history, Parliament will not achieve the mythical 20% mark."
"It is useful to think in terms of an operational budget, but it is necessary to be very attentive and very much on the ball if, as proposed by the Grech report, we wish, as the need arises, to mobilise more money in order to acquire buildings, given that acquisition procedures are extremely protracted, what with the Bureau being required to give a decision, the Committee on Budgets needing to offer an opinion and the Council having to give us the go-ahead."
"If, for example, I were to purchase a building in London or Paris over the next few days, I am not sure that we could, in a few weeks, release the funds for which we had, however, made provision the previous year."
"It is therefore a very good idea to stay below the 20% mark whilst, however, remaining very much on the alert in case an opportunity should present itself."
"The second very important feature of the Grech report is that it has placed the individual at the heart of our objectives."
"Next year, and for the first time, we are going to embark on a new process through the setting up of the parliamentary web-TV channel project, the beginning of the work in our visitors' centre and the meeting of the first citizen 'agora', which will involve people in our legislative work."
"I think that we have made a lot of effort to put the citizen centre stage, and I should not like to conclude without emphasising - since we learned yesterday evening that he was to be leaving - that Mr Priestley, our Secretary-General, has, during the ten years that he has headed the administration, worked hard to modernise our budgetary procedure and to make it more rigorous and transparent."
"(EL) Mr President, the draft budget serves in an absolute manner the anti-grassroots, reactionary policy of the European Union."
"It is within the framework of the new financial framework for 2007-2013, cut and sewn to the measures to strengthen European capital."
"The 2007 budget promotes the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy and the united market, while at the same time cutting resources for many regions, such as Greece, strengthening inequalities and unequal measures with prospects of it not even being included in the poor Cohesion Fund."
"It drastically cuts spending in the agricultural sector, completing the application of the anti-farming reformed CAP, thereby wiping out more small and medium-sized farms and, at the same time, cutting hundreds of jobs."
"This is the modern spirit of the European Union: intensification of work, mass unemployment, poverty-level wages and pensions and, of course, drastic cutbacks and further privatisation both in public health and in social insurance systems."
"Nonetheless, resources are increased by 98% for competitiveness, industrial innovation policy and entrepreneurship, as is the funding for measures for employability, temporary work and class cooperation."
"They call it social dialogue."
"It is a class budget, which is unfair and should be condemned by the grassroots classes, because it brings inequality, injustice, poverty and greater exploitation for the workers and greater profits for capital."
"That is why it should be rejected."
"(PL) Mr President, not only is the 2007 budget the first budget in the new 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, but it is also the first budget relating to 27 Member States, including Bulgaria and Romania."
"For those two reasons alone, it ought to be as high as possible in terms of expenditure."
"The 2007-2013 financial framework indicates that payments may amount, at most, to 1.06% of the Union's GNP."
"Unfortunately, in its draft payments plan, the European Commission proposed payments totalling barely EUR 116 billion, which amounts to only 0.99% of the Union's GNP."
"For its part, the Council of the European Union proposed a further cut of EUR 1.75 billion."
"Against this background, we should welcome the stance of Parliament's Committee on Budgets."
"It proposed payments at a level of EUR 121.9 billion, which amounts to 1.04% of GNP and is around EUR 5.1 billion more than the Commission's proposal."
"Therefore, I very much hope that the House will endorse the proposals made by the Committee on Budgets and that they will be successfully defended throughout the course of our negotiations with the European Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, in his report Mr Elles says that it is essential for policymakers to focus on what the real challenges will be for the EU in the years ahead."
"When David Cameron was campaigning for the leadership of Mr Elles' party last year, he told the Daily Telegraph, 'we must challenge the culture of the EU, leaving it to focus on its real job, making the single market work properly and championing free trade'."
"However, Mr Elles' policy priorities include common foreign and security policy, the European Neighbourhood Policy, terrorist threats, border controls on immigration, environment and communication."
"This is the Tory hidden agenda and it is very different from the one Mr Cameron put forward when he needed the votes from the more Eurosceptic party members."
"But of course this is the same Mr Cameron who was pretending he would leave the PPE-DE."
"One year on, Mr Elles is free to carry on promoting the PPE-DE agenda."
"His real leader, Mr Poettering, is no doubt delighted."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency for at last being so bold as to do something, even if only in a small way, about the sacred cow of appointments in the EU."
"I think it extremely regrettable that the attempt at doing away with at least 200 posts before moving on to doing more of the same sort of thing should be repulsed in the way in which it has been in paragraph 29 of the Elles report."
"That really is the wrong way to go about it."
"To show just why it is so very wrong, let me quote Mrs Guy-Quint, the lady who tabled the amendment, and who said: 'I have never yet heard any rational justification for these cutbacks."
"They are about nothing more than settling personal scores, about offended vanity, intrigues and aggression.'"
"That is what she said in committee."
"Of course, the opposite is the case."
"The EU has done the sensible thing by getting rid of plenty of jobs already, and it would send the right message if we were, for once, to make a few cuts of our own."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, This budget for 2007 follows on seamlessly from that for 2005, and the rapporteur deserves thanks for accomplishing something so unprecedented."
"What we have to do in managing the budget is to do more to combat the waste of EU funds in the shape of displacement effects and lack of efficiency."
"The job cuts in the Commission remain highly controversial; we say 'no' to them, albeit with reservations, and the acid test we apply is what gains in efficiency is the Council prepared to concede that the Commission - in its field offices in Luxembourg, for example - has achieved?"
"How well equipped is the Commission itself to perform its future functions, which will have less to do with making laws and more with the monitoring of how Community law is implemented?"
"There are no more than two posts for monitoring Community environmental law, which accounts for 40% of the laws we adopt."
"Something else that we have to make provision for in the parliamentary budget is the means for dealing with a further loss of credibility on the part of Europe."
"In 2007, we will be appointing nine translators and interpreters of the Irish language, even though eight of the thirteen Irish MEPs do not speak Irish."
"Sixty Members are travelling around with the new EUROLAT parliamentary assembly, adhering, in so doing, to none of the customary practices of parliamentary assemblies, such as intergovernmental agreements, for example."
"This Parliament of ours is having building work carried out at all three of its sites in 2007, and this is something I find difficult to explain to groups of visitors or to the voters back home."
"These are all good issues that we can use to demonstrate that we are taking the Court of Auditors' criticisms seriously and also that we are serious about managing the EU's budget better."
"(PL) Mr President, 2007 will be the first year of a new seven-year Financial Perspective."
"It is therefore particularly important, at this point, for the institutions of the European Union to clearly define the real needs and priorities for the coming years."
"Working on the basis of budgetary discipline and increased efficiency, we should, at the same time, depart from the practice of accepting very high margins of expenditure."
"In the past, this often led to resources being wasted."
"It also seems appropriate to retain the present strategy of purchasing the buildings we use."
"This will result in savings in the long term and make funds available for other activities."
"It also seems essential to review the policy on staff management, particularly regarding outsourcing the implementation of activities, which has a detrimental effect on continuity and stability and could therefore have a negative impact on the functioning of the institutions."
"As far as employment policy is concerned, the posts resulting from enlargement must be our priority at present."
"This process must include information on accommodation for new staff."
"The cuts in the budgets of individual institutions proposed by the Council should not be an aim in themselves."
"Taking into account the enlargement in 2004 and the next one, which is almost upon us, the overriding aim must first and foremost be to ensure the effective operation of all the Union's institutions."
"In conclusion, I should like to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs on a very well prepared document and us on a sound compromise and an ambitious budget."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too should like to congratulate our rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, on their painstaking work, and to thank and congratulate all of my colleagues on the tremendous work put in on this occasion by the Committee on Budgets when examining the 1 200 amendments, with the aim of meeting the expectations of the 450 million people in Europe."
"Firstly, I, for my part, should like once again to point out that I regret the poor contribution made to the European budget by the Member States within the context of the financial perspective."
"This contribution is clearly not enough to implement the policies that it now falls to the European Union to translate into something that Europeans want."
"Our Parliament therefore has relatively little room for manoeuvre in this area."
"If our ambition must be realistic - indeed modest - then let us at least make it as clear as possible."
"That was the proposal made by the Committee on Budgets, and that is what we must examine today and in the weeks to come, by prioritising the most effective policies for attaining these objectives and thus for achieving the world's most powerful knowledge-based economy."
"That is why I welcome the efforts that specifically focused, via the proposals, on research, innovation and development policies; on aid for SMEs; on pilot projects; and on the appropriations earmarked for cultural policies which, according to the recommendations made by our colleague, Mrs de Sarnez, are regarded by Europeans as a fundamental part of our common project."
"Finally, and in keeping with the humanist and realistic image of our European integration process, I welcome the substantial increase in the appropriations dedicated to the policy in favour of the most impoverished people in Europe."
"To conclude, I am pleased that, where external policy is concerned, a balance has been struck that takes account of the peace process in Palestine, even though the reservations voiced will enable us, in my view, to send out a strong signal to the Council in the weeks to come, since we are at first reading."
"(PT) Although it improves upon the Commission's proposal of 0.99% of Community GNI, and that of the Council at 0.98%, in terms of volume of payments, it comes as no surprise that Parliament's proposal for the Community budget for 2007, at 1.04%, falls short in the very first year of what was agreed in the financial perspective, namely 1.06%, which in our view is itself inadequate if we are to promote genuine economic and social cohesion, particularly given the needs of an enlarged EU."
"Given that this is part of the negotiation process, we hope that, unlike what has happened in the past, Parliament will at least seek to ensure that the minimum amounts provided for in the financial perspective for 2007 are adhered to as far as possible, and that these funds are used for the purpose of pursuing an effective economic and social cohesion policy and a genuine policy of cooperation and development."
"Although we welcome the adoption in the Committee on Budgets of specific amendments that we tabled, we are very disappointed that other important proposals that we tabled were rejected, which were as follows: the creation of compensation packages to offset fuel price rises in the fishing industry; the creation of a Community programme to support small-scale traditional coastal fishing as a response to the specific problems experienced in the sector, in accordance with positions previously adopted by Parliament; and an increase in the funds earmarked for convergence in the European Regional Development Fund to compensate fully the 'regions affected by the statistical effect', such as the Algarve, since they have been cut by some 20% this year."
"Mr President, I should like to refer to one particular budgetary matter."
"The Commission is presently finalising its public health programme for 2007-2013."
"We all know that in the recent past the Commission has had very effective information campaigns, highlighting the dangers of tobacco and AIDS within the European Union."
"The Commission has a budget of EUR 56 million per year to highlight public health threats and to implement public information campaigns throughout Europe."
"I believe the time has now come for the Commission to implement an information-awareness campaign to highlight the problem and dangers of, and the cures for, depression within the Union."
"I have also written to many governments of Europe seeking their support for this political initiative."
"One in four people in Europe experience at least one significant episode of mental difficulties during their lives and up to 18 million people in the European Union, aged between 16 and 25, suffer from major depression."
"Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems experienced in Europe."
"Studies have estimated that by 2020 depression will become the highest-ranking disease in the developed world."
"In fact, there are even higher levels of depression in Eastern and Central Europe."
"We have identified the problem; we have the financial resources to highlight it; so let us go forward and meet this challenge now."
"(SV) Mr President, first of all, the June List believes that the European Union's common agricultural policy needs to be scrapped."
"As I have pointed out on so many occasions in this House, EU agricultural policy is reprehensible because the money is given to the wrong recipients, and often to recipients who are very rich."
"What is more, it denies the world's poor countries an honest opportunity to sell their agricultural produce on the EU market because we subsidise non-competitive agriculture."
"Secondly, the June List believes that structural policy should be returned to the national competence."
"The EU resources that come back to Sweden come with a very large number of conditions attached and are in most cases not adapted to Swedish needs."
"Next year, Sweden's contribution to the EU budget will rise to a good EUR 3 billion."
"We shall get back approximately EUR 1 billion."
"Thirdly, then, the June List believes that Sweden's membership fee should be halved in the light of how distorting and unjust the EU's agricultural and trade policy is."
"(FR) Mr President, the European budget is like the theatre of Bertolt Brecht."
"While 'Waiting for Godot' - while waiting for 2014 and own resources - we are managing the most modest of appropriations: EUR 116 billion in payment appropriations, which is not even 1% of gross national income."
"A game is being played here."
"For example, the nomenclature has been changed, with a shift from eight headings to six."
"An attempt has been made at humour: the Europe of 17 million unemployed is referred to under Heading 1 as 'growth and employment'."
"The CAP budget, which is destroying farming and fruit and vegetable growing and uprooting 400 000 hectares of land, is referred to under Heading 2 as 'confirmation of resources'."
"These changes in form apart, this is a classic budget in every respect."
"Firstly, it includes a financial framework for 2007-2013, which is contained within an interinstitutional agreement - the fourth of its kind - signed on 17 May."
"It includes Malthusian sums, for example for agriculture: indeed, market expenditure is going to be wilfully reduced by more than EUR 500 million."
"It also includes the great classics: EUR 7 billion with which to toy with external policy in the world;"
"EUR 5 billion for a research framework programme that will not research much; and EUR 850 million for the trans-European networks."
"All of that, while we await the 2008-2009 review during which every issue will be discussed - not only the UK rebate but also, and above all, agriculture and the agricultural budget."
"The great budget debate will therefore take place between 2010 and 2014."
"While we wait to discuss the fisheries sector, Erasmus and the citizens, and if we cannot take tea - since it is almost 5 p.m. - we prefer, during this afternoon's budget debate, to exchange the little budgetary titbits with which our rapporteur has embellished his magnificent report, which is, all the same, very pleasing."
"(EL) Mr President, the European Union is the most ambitious endeavour in history."
"Yet we are funding this endeavour with a minimum 1% of GDP."
"It is not only that we are giving so little; it is that the Commission and the Council do not even want the minimum amounts committed to be taken up."
"The Commission made provision in the preliminary draft for just 1%."
"The Council reduced it still further to 0.98% and we increased it to 1.04%."
"The Council is doing its best to reduce funding for the Union, the Commission is not doing its best to defend it and thus this role falls to the European Parliament alone."
"Many also proposed that we should put spending on agriculture in reserve."
"We rejected that proposal."
"The destruction of European farmers is not a development policy or a unification policy of Europe; it is - quite simply - a disastrous policy."
"Now to a sensitive political issue: we reinstated the amendment for the restoration of Christian churches in northern Cyprus."
"A vote in favour of this amendment will demonstrate Europe's respect for its cultural heritage and will strengthen the application of European principles for peaceful coexistence between different religious and ethnic groups."
"Lastly, so far we have been informed after the event about the Council's decisions on the CFSP."
"This cannot continue."
"We need to debate in advance with the Council all the basic options, before the decisions are taken which we are then called on to fund."
"In order to send our message to the Council, we reduced spending on the CFSP in 2007 by 50%."
"I should like at this point to say, while agreeing that Mr Elles was obviously right, that the Minister will be making a mistake if he truly believes that what we did was what she herself called 'tactical words'."
"I hope that the Council will now rethink its stand to date."
"(SK) Energy security is one of the political priorities of the new financial perspective and the 2007 budget of the European Union."
"It is part of the Competitiveness and Innovations Programme, and there is also a separate research programme within the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Our goals in this area are ambitious: we would like to transform the unsustainable, fossil fuel-based energy system into a sustainable one that draws on a variety of energy sources; we must improve energy efficiency, secure energy supplies, prevent climate change, and increase the competitiveness of European enterprises, first in the energy sector and then elsewhere."
"The strategy of the European Union and the European budget are important factors in helping to tackle the bleak outlook for European citizens as regards the provision of sustainable, stable and affordable energy."
"Undoubtedly, the budget for 2007, that is to say, the first year of a new programming period, is of strategic significance."
"However, it is necessary to emphasise that resources are limited and much will depend on how efficiently they are used."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, 2007 is going to be a very exciting financial year, for in it, that which the Heads of State or Government, in December last year, adopted as their political priority, and was agreed on by this House and the Council this May, is, for the first time, to become a living reality."
"There are a few aspects of this that I am already getting seriously worried about."
"This very week, we will be adopting a number of legal bases for multiannual programmes intended to run with effect from 1 January next year."
"The stage we are currently at is that the Member States are putting together their framework plans for the conduct of structural policy and submitting them to the Commission."
"My very real concern is that the 2007 budget will become an austerity budget as a consequence of many programmes not even being able to get started, even though they are urgently needed."
"What I will say, in quite specific terms, and speaking as someone from a country that has the honour of providing the EU with one-fifth of its funding, is that our concern is that, when so much money is called for - despite the lack of any increase over the past in terms of percentages of gross national income, although I will mention in passing that gross national income has increased as a consequence of enlargement - there must of course be some value given in return for this money."
"It is for that reason that I am very glad that our rapporteur, Mr Elles, has said that we want to fund more programmes and less administration, although what the Commission still has to do is to demonstrate that it can run the programmes in a proper manner and that all this will not be absorbed by administration costs."
"The agencies are another issue that we really have to sort out, since there are apparently going to be three more of them."
"What I also want to say with regard to this House's budget is that we have to reap the benefit of what we have achieved through the success of our building policy."
"It is intolerable that we should, just because the money is available, keep on inflating the parliamentary budget and funding things that may well not actually be needed, such as WebTV, for example."
"What we need, then, is value for money, and that is what matters most of all."
"The report from the Court of Auditors that was presented this morning gives me reason to believe that there is a great potential there for more to be achieved."
"(HU) I would like to join Mr Ferber, in stating that the 2007 budget does indeed have particular significance for all of Europe and specifically for the new Member States, including Hungary."
"This is the first year of the 2007-2013 financial perspective which we have been involved in drawing up, and which thus fully applies to us."
"Consequently, especially given the lengthy and not always smooth process of its development, it is very important that 2007 should constitute a good starting point for the subsequent years."
"This presents us all with both an exceptional opportunity and a responsibility."
"It is an opportunity in the sense that by making use of the resources approved in the financial perspective, we can begin not only our own process of catching up, but also the structural and cohesion policies that serve as the foundation for Europe's future and its competitiveness."
"At the same time, we must take responsibility for overcoming the national self-interest that has, regrettably, become commonplace in both the old and the new Member States when it comes to preparing the budget."
"Let us not neglect the common values of Europe as a whole and the international role of the EU."
"(MT) The budget that this Parliament will be approving next year will, for the first time, allocate money to a new fund known as the External Borders Fund, purposely created to help Member States strengthen their borders with a view to curtailing the uninterrupted flow of illegal immigration."
"Given the seriousness of the illegal immigration emergency, it is almost unbelievable that this is only the first time that the European Union is establishing a fund specifically for external borders, but we have succeeded."
"Thanks to this Parliament, the budget for this Fund will be greater than that requested by the Commission itself."
"I am talking about a budget amounting to EUR 170 million and designed to protect our frontiers more effectively and thus reduce the influx."
"My second point is about FRONTEX, the European Agency for External Borders."
"Up to now, this Agency, which has only been in operation for one year, has not been allocated enough resources to do its work."
"Suffice it to say that while, up to last week, FRONTEX was coordinating patrols in the Mediterranean, yesterday I saw an advert in the papers announcing that FRONTEX wanted to recruit a director responsible for its sea patrols."
"This shows that we must not leave this Agency to its own devices in the belief that it will solve everything."
"Therefore, even in this regard, it is gratifying that this Parliament will vote a bigger budget than the Commission requested, almost EUR 35 million, to strengthen this Agency and help it to carry out its duties more effectively."
"It is a pity, Mr President, that, rather than follow suit, some European governments have, in a most miserly manner, tried to cut the FRONTEX budget."
"We would like them to know that the European Parliament will be doing its utmost to ensure that FRONTEX is given all the means necessary to carry out its duties."
"(EL) Mr President, the priorities of this budget should have been clear and adequate in terms of funding, so as to promote the integration of the new Member States."
"Instead, in the Council an accounting attitude prevailed in order to reduce appropriations and in the Commission its fearful stand."
"How will the Lisbon Strategy be accomplished?"
"How will the Structural Fund programmes be completed?"
"With EUR 425 million less?"
"How will the rural development policy be implemented?"
"With the fictional transfer from the first pillar though the voluntary modulation mechanism or - as proposed - by putting rural development funds in reserve until the Commission decides and gives guarantees for voluntary modulation?"
"How will the role of the Union be strengthened in its foreign actions, in the Balkans, in Palestine, in immigration?"
"By reducing the CFSP by 50%?"
"How will Europe compete with America in the field of research and competitiveness?"
"We cannot set political priorities and not provide the necessary financial tools to implement them."
"We are losing credibility and this is undermining the future of the European Union."
"(HU) I would like to share four thoughts with you and comment on one problem."
"The Commission's proposals for next year's budget are well below of the resources provided for in the financial perspective."
"The EU's competitiveness is deteriorating rather than improving."
"Secondly, it is a nightmare that the Council has tried to cut back even this moderate proposal."
"Thirdly, in its current form this will not allow for any development, but simply represents an unsuccessful attempt at survival."
"Fourthly: it is good news for the new Member States that the great rush to cut back does not affect support for the cohesion funds, or has a minimal effect."
"The problem, undoubtedly a significant one, is that while one of the characteristics of the Union is expressed as 'unity in diversity', we are at present far from satisfying this requirement."
"The translations of the proposals are either not prepared in time or are done so only at the last minute, and sometimes only in rough form."
"We are obliged to participate in many meetings at which only some MEPs have native language interpreters available."
"The enlargement of the Union in January will further increase justified demands in this area."
"Linguistic diversity is a value that we can under no circumstances renounce."
"(DE) Mr President, as a number of speakers have already said, what we have here before us is the first budget of the new financial period, and one that is described as a budget for savings, even though the only savings have been in terms of the interests of the European public."
"What we are dealing with here is a misconceived budget policy on the part of the European Union's Member States."
"Over the next seven years, then, the Trans-European Networks will have to get along with only EUR 8 billion instead of the EUR 20 billion that they actually need."
"Once more, the Council of Ministers has recourse to the old coercive trick of telling us, in this House, that if we do not pass the budget promptly, the programmes due to start in 2007 will not be able to do so on time."
"The Council can, and will, make scapegoats of Parliament and other bodies, even though it sometimes drags out its own decision-making processes over many months, and this is something we have to be on our guard against."
"While I am on this subject, let me remind the Commission that it is this House, rather than the Council, that is constantly defending the Commission's line, and it would have a salutary effect if the Commission were sometimes to be aware of that rather than constantly bowing down and taking dictation from the Council."
"Also this week, we have to come to a decision on a quite unacceptable proposal that has been made for plugging a hole in the budget in the second pillar, in agriculture and rural affairs, which involves the Member States being allowed to shift up to 20% of the funds from the first pillar into the second, into rural areas, and that has been inadequately thought out."
"It runs counter to the prerogatives of this House, and it should be rejected."
"What do these two things - the trans-European networks and rural areas - have in common?"
"Firstly, they have both fallen victim to the Council's irresponsible austerity policy; secondly, in both cases, the Commission has distanced itself from its original position and quietly gone back to taking dictation from the Council, and thirdly, in both cases we have to try to put funds in reserve as a means towards bringing pressure to bear on both the Council and the Commission, in order to eventually save whatever can yet be saved."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who have shown prudence in their respective draft budgets."
"Prudence does not necessarily mean an agreement with the Council, because it does not necessarily mean agreeing with the indiscriminate reductions that the Council has established in those budget lines that were not of interest to it, in other words all those that do not relate to common foreign and security policy, a field in which Parliament has made a reduction."
"We very much agree with the principle of value for money which our rapporteur advocates for the general budget, particularly at a time like this, a time of extreme financial restriction."
"Given the European Union's prevailing ideology, which some of us do not share, of applying 1% to the budget, a careful analysis of the budget lines, of their level of execution and of European added value is essential."
"Perhaps we do not see the notion of 'value for money' in the same way as the Council, but, in any event, it is good that it should be accepted as a budgetary principle."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for being here for the majority of the budgetary debate; that does not normally happen and I therefore thank her."
"Issues such as the fight against terrorism, the funding of a genuine common immigration policy and implementation of the policies linked to the Lisbon Strategy are treated as a priority by the European Parliament at its first reading."
"We agree with the strategy on payments proposed by our rapporteur, as well as with the proposed focus on the funding of the common foreign and security policy."
"Finally, Mr President, we see the budgetary reserves as a very useful instrument, not just for negotiation and good financial management, but also so that, as budgetary authority, we can acquire the information that the Commission often finds it difficult to provide us with for practical reasons."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Membership of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Commission Question Time"
"Mr President, the Commission currently receives fewer complaints about overbooking than before the compensation levels were raised by Regulation (EC) No 261/2004."
"At the present time, only 8% of the complaints received by the Commission concerning air passengers' rights relate to instances of overbooking or denied boarding, while 60% refer to delays or cancellations."
"This trend is due, among other things, to the development of low-cost carriers and to the increasingly frequent use of charter companies, which do not tend to integrate overbooking into their working methods."
"Since this regulation entered into force, the airlines have demonstrated more flexibility in looking for volunteers who will agree to give up their seats in return for certain agreed benefits."
"This practice encourages the airlines to resolve the problem there and then."
"That being said, I should like to point out to Mr Evans that, in accordance with Article 17 of the regulation, the Commission is going to present a report on the functioning and application of this regulation to Parliament and the Council at the start of 2007."
"This communication will be based on a study carried out by an external consultant."
"An invitation to tender has been published for the purposes of recruiting this external consultant."
"Overbooking is one of the items that will be dealt with in this study, and the Commission will obviously wait to learn the results of the study before it decides whether or not there are grounds to adapt the legislation."
"The fact is, Mr Evans, while these new regulations have indeed had a noticeable effect on passengers' rights, it is the decline in overbooking that has become, in certain cases - it must be said - a trend that is very detrimental to passengers."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for that very thorough and clear answer."
"However, it is a fact that people still complain about over-booking."
"My other concern is that there are still airline companies which are ignoring this Regulation on Air Passengers' Rights and are telling their customers that it does not apply to them."
"Is the Commission going to get tough on some of these operators who seem to think they can operate outside the law and outside EU regulations?"
"Mr Titley, it is absolutely vital that we ensure that these passengers' rights are applied."
"I must also say that, at the moment, I am trying to call on all of the airports to display passengers' rights, so that it is quite clear that all passengers must be informed of the fact that they cannot be made the subject of an overbooking without being offered significant compensation in return, as the regulation stipulates."
"There are three key words in relation to this issue: information, investigation and audit, as I pointed out to you."
"Next, we shall see whether there are grounds to impose penalties or, at any rate, to bring before the Court of Justice those Member States that have not really monitored the application of these passengers' rights."
"There you have it, Mr Titley."
"I thank you for your question, which highlights the importance of applying European law."
"(DE) Mr President, the Vice-President of the Commission was right to point out that we, together, have managed to solve the problem of over-bookings or, at any rate, to improve the situation."
"In adopting this directive back in 2004, we had set the standard for delays very low after the airlines told us that the 9/11 disaster meant that stringent rules would make life virtually impossible for them."
"They make a practice of simply letting delays pile up, so that, with several landing and takeoff manoeuvres in the course of a day, these delays eventually add up to many hours, for which no financial compensation is paid."
"We have put stringent rules in place for the benefit of railway passengers, who can be entitled to full reimbursement of their fares, yet airline passengers ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I just briefly want to say to Mr Rack that we receive numerous complaints about excessive delays and that we specifically wanted to carry out this audit in order to determine how exactly we can ensure that the new passengers' rights are applied more effectively."
"You are right: as European citizens, we have a right to demand to be treated decently as air passengers and, in the future, as rail passengers."
"Therefore, rest assured, Mr Rack, that it is indeed the aim of the Commissioner for Transport to ensure that passengers' rights are applied more and more rigorously."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I am glad that the number of complaints appears to be relatively low, but I have myself had the experience - for we are relatively frequent flyers - of the last three flights I was on being overbooked."
"I would now be interested to know whether this is a more frequent occurrence on any airlines in particular."
"Can it be said that there are certain airlines that make overbooking a matter of professional practice?"
"Might it not, under certain circumstances, be possible to consider taking action - quite apart from proceedings for breach of contract - against these companies, not only in order to obtain compensation, but against those companies themselves."
"What is the likelihood of an improved public relations effort to make passengers aware of the possibility of compensation payments?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication that the European Commission adopted in July, at my suggestion, addresses the general theme of a European strategy on the protection of children's rights."
"It is clear that special attention is paid in this European strategy to the risk of children and young people falling victim to the actions of criminal paedophiles who use the Internet."
"We support very strong preventative action."
"In particular, we are in favour of the creation of an international database that can gather together all of the principal data relating to criminals and to those who operate via the Internet for paedophilic purposes, mainly so that we can stop the spread of images that, obviously for reasons to do with sexual exploitation, affect children and young people, and so that we can root out and clamp down on the culprits, namely those who use the Internet for these purposes."
"We have also decided to fund a programme called 'Safer Internet plus', which consists of a European network of telephone lines and, above all, of Internet communications aimed at allowing Internet users to cooperate with the police."
"Through this system of safer Internet use, which is called Safer Internet plus, Internet users will be able to inform the police authorities or Internet providers of any potentially dangerous 'hits', and thus the presence of those who use the Internet for pornographic purposes."
"Furthermore, we have recently adopted a communication on the trafficking of human beings that includes a chapter specifically dedicated to children and to violence against children."
"I am looking into the application of the framework decision on the fight against the sexual exploitation of minors and children and against the use of children in pornography."
"In conjunction with the application of this framework decision, I believe that we will be able to come up with measures to further enhance the legislative framework and to clamp down even more harshly on Internet-based sexual exploitation that harms children."
"I will report on this issue before the end of the year in a Commission communication."
"Finally, the general theme of computer crime will be addressed at the start of next year with a strategic document that will contain a chapter specifically dedicated to child protection."
"Mr Ebner will be aware that we have refinanced the Daphne programme."
"The Daphne II programme is dedicated to European initiatives combating violence not only against children but also against women and will have a budget of EUR 50 million for the new operating period."
"Through this system, we plan to promote best practice in preventing violence against children and to launch information campaigns aimed at promoting more responsible Internet use on the part of children and young people."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Frattini for his very thorough reply."
"I must acknowledge the fact that he has done some very extensive work in this area, and I believe that he will succeed in bringing about the security and the protection that we want for our children."
"I hope that this programme and its activities bear fruit and I, for my part, hope that Parliament will firmly support its work."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly grateful to Mr Ebner."
"We are currently at the implementation stage."
"The European strategic plan will, however, include other important advances."
"We are thinking about launching a European emergency helpline in the near future for children who are in difficulty."
"It will have the same three numbers for the whole of Europe - 116 - followed by a national number for each country, and will help children who have been kidnapped, who are lost or who are in difficulty."
"Together with the major international credit card companies, I am also looking into the possibility of blocking the credit cards of those who access paedophile websites for the purposes of buying pornographic material involving children."
"Everyone will recognise that a threat such as this is already in itself a signal designed to strongly discourage this type of criminal."
"I am asking my question as the father of Emily, who turns five on Friday, and Oliver, who will be two and a half."
"Oliver is not yet surfing the net, but Emily already is."
"I fully share the views put forward by the Commissioner and the previous speakers about protecting youth, but can the Commissioner guarantee that we are not starting to impose restrictions on our general use of the internet, because the last thing we want is a headline to the effect that the European Union is preventing us from using the internet freely?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously, no one is thinking about restricting people's use of the Internet, which is one of the most extraordinary means of communication, insofar as it puts children and young people throughout the world in touch with each other."
"However, it is quite clear that we must make sure that we root out and clamp down on criminals who use the Internet in order to establish closer contact with young people, who must obviously be protected."
"It is therefore not by restricting Internet use, but by doing more in terms of prevention and control, that we can help children to use the Internet in complete safety."
"Subject: Stoning of seven women in Iran"
"According to Amnesty International news release MDE 13/111/2006, seven Iranian women, Parisa Akbari, Iran Eskandari, Khayrieh Valania, Shamameh Ghorbani, Kobra Najjar, Soghra Mola'i and Fatemeh, face imminent stoning in Iran."
"Despite repeated assurances from the Iranian regime frequently transmitted by the Community authorities promising moratoria or the suspension of this barbaric practice, reports of the sentencing and execution of women have continued to mount since the European Union embarked on its 'human rights dialogue' with the regime."
"Can the Commission explain the reasons for the total failure of the human rights objectives that it outlined for its policy of dialogue with the Iranian regime?"
"Can it say what specific action it has taken to prevent the murder of these Iranian women?"
"Member of the Commission."
"The Commission remains deeply concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and views the practice of execution by lapidation as particularly abhorrent."
"It is fully aware of the reports by Amnesty International covering sentences of stoning, referred to by the honourable Members."
"Stoning is a cruel, inhuman and degrading form of punishment, which the Commission finds totally unacceptable."
"The EU has repeatedly called on Iran progressively to restrict the use of the death penalty and insisted that it be carried out according to UN minimum standards, including the requirement that capital punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes."
"In December 2002, the EU started a human rights dialogue with the Iranian authorities, with the participation of civil society representatives."
"One of the practical results at the time was confirmation by the Iranian side of a moratorium on stoning."
"Regrettably that dialogue has not taken place since the summer of 2004 because of the reluctance of the Iranian authorities."
"However, tentative dates for a new round of human rights discussions have been fixed for mid-December."
"- (PT) Mr President, so the Iranian authorities have promised a moratorium and have failed to keep to it; no surprise there."
"What I should like to ask you, Commissioner, is why the Commission insists on talking with a fanatical clique that is tyrannising Iran, rather than with the vast majority of Iranians, who think differently."
"I should like to recommend a book to you, written in your language, entitled We are Iran, a collection of writings by a large number of Iranians who think differently and with whom the Commission ought to speak."
"Member of the Commission."
"We talk to all elements of civil society in Iran."
"It is difficult for the honourable Member on the one hand to ask us to make representations; to make a case to the Iranian authorities; to make a stand for human rights and against this abhorrent practice; and, at the same time, to criticise us for engaging in a dialogue."
"If you do not have a dialogue, then it is harder, if not impossible, to communicate your view."
"In my view, the European approach is right."
"In close collaboration with EU embassies in Tehran, the Commission monitors the situation on the ground very closely, in particular as far as the death penalty is concerned."
"Whenever it learns of a death sentence passed on juveniles or on women at risk of stoning, the EU undertakes immediate démarches with the judiciary and other competent authorities."
"So the EU is not relying on dialogue alone."
"It makes its views very directly and clearly known whenever such a case arises, and will continue to do so."
"Commissioner, when you say that the European Commission takes the human rights situation in Iran seriously, when is this issue discussed in other dialogues with Iran?"
"We now have a dialogue about the nuclear programme in Iran."
"Is this issue addressed in those negotiations, or in the negotiations on trade issues?"
"This is a serious matter and I do not think it is enough to say that we are trying to get back to the negotiating table on human rights."
"This has to be put on the agenda in all dialogues with Iran."
"When do you intend to do that?"
"Member of the Commission."
"The Commission follows up human rights cases through several channels."
"It does not simply rely on the dialogue, the last session of which was held in June 2004, and another session of which is due to take place shortly."
"We make diplomatic representations through a variety of different channels, in addition to the set-piece dialogue that is in place, and we shall continue to do so."
"(PT) Following the remarks of previous speakers, I should like to know the Commission's position on the rape of pregnant women and young children, as a means of silencing the opposition in Iran."
"This is a violation of women's rights and human rights, and I should like to know if the Commission is aware that this occurs and what its position is on the matter."
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for asking the question."
"This gives me the opportunity to give an answer which I know is very important to Parliament, because Parliament has given much prominence to the topic of international roaming in recent years."
"As you know, for citizens there are two problems: first, the high prices they have to pay for crossing the borders; and then the problem of inadvertent roaming on a foreign network when they have not yet crossed the border but are living in a border area."
"In competitive markets one expects to see convergence of prices and costs, but when it comes to roaming there has been for many years now no evidence of a real relationship between prices and underlying costs."
"This point was also made very clearly in the impact assessment which accompanied the regulation which I have put on the table."
"The question is very simple."
"Why should a French customer who just crosses the border to Italy and makes a local call be charged from 50 cents to over EUR 1 per minute, when an Italian customer who is doing exactly the same will be charged between 10 and 13 cents per minute?"
"All right, there are some additional costs if you take your phone into a neighbouring country, but there is very little justification for such high differences in price."
"In every other area of telecoms - fixed and broadband - European consumers are seeing significant improvements in price, choice and quality; only for international roaming has this not been the case."
"There are millions of citizens who have been very frustrated at these high prices for many years."
"We estimate that there are roughly 99 million European citizens living in regions located within 50 km of the borders and 11 million citizens within 5 km of the borders."
"They are those most affected by the extraordinarily high roaming prices."
"The regulation I have proposed, which is under discussion in Parliament and the Council, proposes substantial reductions in the roaming charges for all Europeans, consumers and business travellers."
"It is clear that when that is put in place, those living and roaming in internal border regions will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the regulation."
"From a technical point of view, because of the nature of mobile networks, consumers who live in such areas will have to pay some roaming charges, but there will be guarantees, if the regulation is passed, that the prices will be far more reasonable than they are today."
"There is also the question of inadvertent roaming, which is a possibility wherever mobile services are available and national borders exist."
"That is also why it is very important for those people that the charges will be closer to the cost."
"I very often criticise the operators for charging high prices."
"On the other hand, I must also say that when operators make the right moves in the right direction, I have to give credit where it is due."
"I am pleased to note, for example, that operators in Ireland and the United Kingdom have started to offer all-island rates."
"That means, for instance, that citizens in Ireland and in Northern Ireland now pay only one single rate, irrespective of where they are."
"That is a good example of best practice."
"I would like to see such initiatives encouraged and followed in other areas across Europe."
"(NL) Mr President, roaming costs, particularly those in border regions, account for some EUR 5 billion annually in unacceptable and, in fact, unnecessary expense for businesses and residents alike."
"I am therefore indebted to Commissioner Reding for her very emphatic intervention in recent months and also today, but a voluntary solution between businesses in the border regions for this problem of roaming, of which one is hardly aware, where one is moved from one network to another several times a day, is a major problem;"
"I therefore fear that things will not get solved sufficiently promptly if they are done on a voluntary basis."
"So I would ask the Commissioner, and the whole of the Commission, whether it is prepared to draft progress report on this subject."
"I think that we need to step up our efforts, for I know that the border regions would like to have a say too."
"Unfortunately the national regulators do not have explicit powers to prevent or reduce the possibility of inadvertent roaming."
"As the international roaming problem has shown, we do not yet have an internal market in this area."
"That is why we have to follow this very closely in order to find good examples and underline them."
"In Ireland, for instance, Comreg and Ofcom have agreed to set up a joint working group to investigate the extent of the problem of inadvertent roaming by mobile users and we welcome and encourage that approach."
"But it is not yet possible to address the problem on a wider scale through the normal regulatory process."
"(DE) Commissioner, the foreign surcharges on the new UMTS technology are even more pricey than on conventional mobiles; if you surf abroad, even if only over a partner network, you lose a lot of money fast, and the bill does not generally show whether it has been calculated by the minute or by volume."
"Is the Commission planning to ensure greater transparency in this area by way of the Roaming Regulation?"
"Member of the Commission."
"I was asked specifically by Parliament, among others, to address the question of international roaming charges for mobile phones."
"At the time I examined this matter, there was no specific demand for action on data services, such as SMS, and when the national regulatory authorities called on the Commission to do something, they were only concerned about the high level of international roaming charges for voice telephony."
"I know from the many discussions I have held, particularly with Members of Parliament and with citizens, that there is also a problem with data."
"Parliament, which is examining the regulation, now has the opportunity to go a step further than the Commission did."
"Let me also appeal to businesses, since industry is always complaining that we intervene in price regulation."
"Operators now have a chance to show that they themselves are capable of bringing prices down, so that the regulators or politicians do not need to intervene."
"Commissioner, you have given convincing examples of the absurd situation as regards roaming prices in different countries, but you did not mention the new Member States of the EU, where the situation is even worse."
"Will the Commission pay special attention to the new Member States of the European Union with a view to eliminating the very big differences in general mobile telephone and roaming charges?"
"Member of the Commission."
"The honourable Member is correct: the Greek electronic communications market has unfortunately suffered from a very long delay in the transposition of the regulatory framework."
"It should have been in force in 2003. It was only completed in Greece in June 2006."
"We have seen very clearly that where the framework is not in place there is no competition."
"Where there is no competition there is less investment."
"That is one of the problems in Greece."
"On a more positive note, EU structural assistance in Greece provides substantial co-funding for investments aimed at promoting speedier adoption of ICT in Greece and, in particular, for broadband internet in schools and public organisations in remote, island or mountainous areas. Cohesion funds in Greece also permit projects for the acquisition of informatics equipment in schools or public organisations in the regions, including remote, island or mountainous areas."
"As you also know, Greece has started the implementation of a major project aimed at extending broadband access to those Greek regions outside Athens and Thessaloniki which do not yet have that connection and, under normal commercial circumstances, would not get it."
"The Greek Government has also launched the DIODOS project, which established a high-capacity Greek internet educational network through which a number of internet providers are offering advanced internet services to research, academic and education communities at prices that are expected to be 50% below current retail prices."
"You will also be aware that the Commission is working very hard on bridging the digital divide."
"That is why the Commission recently published a communication on bridging the broadband gap, which gives a strong commitment to achieve broadband for all Europeans through policy, budget aid and regulatory instruments."
"Included in that are the structural funds, but also - and this is new - the rural funds, in full respect of state aid rules."
"The communication proposes action that aims at strengthening current policies, national broadband strategies and reinforcing the exchange of best practices through a website."
"We believe it is very important for the regions to understand what other regions have done and to see what they might be able to copy or adapt to their specific needs."
"In that sense we hope that the many problems that persist in some regions, and especially in Greece, can gradually be overcome."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply, which fully satisfied me."
"I should also like to extend my special thanks to her for visiting Cyprus and for visiting the ENISA, thereby helping to resolve numerous problems for the benefit of this organisation."
"We extend our special thanks to you, both Greece and Cyprus, for your visit to Heraklion."
"Member of the Commission."
"Besides being a beautiful island, Crete is also a region striving to overcome the broadband gap it faces and I know that the honourable Member is helping to pursue that goal in his capacity as a representative of Crete."
"Any help we can give, of course, must come through the Greek Government, because, in the case of structural or rural development funds, it is the government which must take the initiative."
"The Commission is willing to provide help, so that the large gap which still exists in the non-urban areas of Greece can be narrowed."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner."
"In Ireland the schools fare better and students are fine while they are at school."
"When they are at home, however, the situation is very poor; 25% of the population cannot get broadband."
"Has the Commission given serious consideration to filling the gap by new technologies, such as WiMAX, although these need spectrum and frequency access?"
"Have you considered this and do you have a response to it?"
"Many of my constituents cannot get access to broadband and students are deprived of the technology when they go home."
"Member of the Commission."
"It is clear that there are many techniques and technologies that can bridge the broadband gap."
"The Commission has always been very consistent in saying that we need technological neutrality."
"We cannot favour one technology over another and sometimes a mix of technologies is the right approach."
"Fibre is not always the answer; sometimes satellites can be more efficient."
"In the Nordic states, for example, where there are a lot of geographical problems and problems of distance, this mix of technologies has provided a solution."
"I know from the statistics for schools with broadband internet access that Ireland is not doing wonderfully well."
"That is astonishing, because I know that education on the new technologies in Ireland is very advanced."
"I therefore hope that the broadband gap in Ireland can be filled and that in future all schools will be able to reach the world through the new technologies."
"I was glad that the Commissioner, in her first answer, reinforced the importance of sustaining competition and the access obligations in the framework of broadband delivery."
"I wonder if she would like to confirm to the House that she will be resisting the calls from certain operators and even regulators for a regulatory holiday for certain levels of investment in broadband?"
"Secondly, bearing in mind that she and I will be at the global forum on internet governance next week, can she confirm that she will be joining us in promoting the virtues of competition on a global scale, in order to raise the level of broadband connection globally and reduce costs?"
"Member of the Commission."
"My answer to the honourable Member is that, according to information from the registry, the number of applications submitted during the sunrise period was 346 218, of which 181 306 were filed during the first phase and 164 912 during the second."
"The current rate of rejection for applications from Ireland is 46%, compared to an overall EU rejection rate of 34%."
"The complete table with a breakdown of all applications per prior right and country of applicant can be found on the registry's website."
"The kind of documentary evidence to be provided by an applicant depends on the national law of the Member State in which the prior right is established."
"There are huge differences between the legal systems of the Member States, which are reflected in the more or less complicated means needed to prove the existence of a prior right."
"This results in a higher or lower rate of rejection of applications in certain countries, such as Ireland."
"As to the question of whether the registry provided Irish registrars with the necessary means to comply fully with the application process, the Commission is not aware of any specific discrimination in this respect."
"From October 2005 - that is, two months before the launch of the sunrise period - the registry published on its website and in all the official languages a detailed description of all technical and administrative measures concerning the registration procedures."
"This information, by the way, is still available online to any interested party."
"During that same period, the registry also set up a call centre, where applicants could obtain quick responses to their questions in 20 official languages."
"As to the alternative dispute resolution procedure, its purpose is promptly to resolve disputes between domain name holders on matters such as cyber-squatting or intellectual property rights, as well as in relation to individual decisions by the registry."
"Should an Irish applicant consider that he or she falls within either of these two categories, the Commission is of the opinion that the alternative dispute resolution procedure is indeed a fair method for remedying the problem."
"In conclusion, the Commission considers that the information made available by the public registry is sufficient for applicants and for registrars to proceed with the registration of domain names during the registration period and afterwards."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"Despite our performance on broadband, it is nice to hear the Commission acknowledge what has happened in Northern Ireland and Ireland as regards roaming, which I hope will serve as a model for other countries."
"In her answer, the Commissioner firmly placed the blame on national governments for their inadequate legislation."
"This is true not only of Ireland but also of the United Kingdom."
"Mr Patrik Lindén, the communications manager of EURid, has put it very bluntly indeed."
"I will take your message back and will certainly point out that at national and local level much of the responsibility for the fact that we are way behind the rest of Europe effectively rests with our own government and our own legislation."
"Fair Trade has made enormous progress in getting labelled products onto supermarket shelves and into mainstream buying habits and practices."
"The same cannot yet be claimed for crafts and garments."
"The Commission will consider, as part of the follow-up to Parliament's report, whether there is scope for action in this area."
"When I said in Parliament in July that 'what is required to tackle poverty and to enhance development is a fair and coherent policy framework', this was not limited to Fair Trade - though I acknowledged the helpful role that the report on Fair Trade and development would play."
"So whilst the Commission is considering how to capitalise further on the role of the Fair Trade movement, there are a number of other wider actions that it can undertake."
"In cooperation with developing countries, we can promote decent work and international labour standards, as well as the interaction between decent work and other policies."
"The new thematic programme on investing in people, which comprises awareness-raising, training, information-sharing and the development of a set of indicators to monitor progress, will be an important tool."
"The close link between decent work and poverty reduction is increasingly well understood in the EU."
"In the 'European Consensus on Development' - a document published in 2005 - employment and social cohesion are recognised as one of the nine areas of Community action."
"Employment, decent work and social cohesion are also central in the EU-Africa strategy."
"In May 2006, the Commission adopted a communication on decent work for all, which will be presented at the Commission Conference on Decent Work and Globalisation in December, where the issues will be tackled in a comprehensive framework."
"We are also contributing to the adoption of international norms and standards for all products, including textiles, through ongoing trade-related activities at bilateral and regional level."
"One example is a quality support programme in Bangladesh, which focuses on the improvement of the quality standards, metrology and accreditation systems in the country to help national laboratories ensure regional and multilateral recognition and acceptability of the conformity assessment certificates."
"The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute will also be strengthened in its basic capacity as a standards-setting body and in the area of metrology."
"The programme will help to enable Bangladesh to address multilateral requirements, as well as to increase the competitiveness of its export industry."
"The project aims to create public-private partnerships and promote in particular awareness of quality and environmental managements systems and social standards - ISO 14000 and SA 8000 certified companies have increased in number - as well as strengthening the Consumer Association, through which pressure for change and control will be built up."
"Thank you for that answer, Commissioner."
"I entirely accept that there are wider issues in trade and development than Fair Trade alone."
"However, I should still like to hear from the Commission that you will give specific support to developing clear criteria for assessing Fair Trade assurance schemes."
"I should also like you to reflect on ways to boost transparency in pricing, so that consumers can see if the Fair Trade premium is passed back by supermarkets, as well as seeing that if they buy their ten-pound or fifteen-euro dress, their bargain may be at the expense of a decent living for textile workers."
"Member of the Commission."
"I sympathise with what the honourable Member is suggesting."
"I think that consumer information, consumer power in this context, is indeed the key."
"Fair Trade relies on consumers who have heard about the difficulties faced by poor producers and want to do something about it."
"We can help mainly by helping consumers to be clear about what is on offer, but we are looking for opportunities to support the Fair Trade movement when it comes up with targeted requests."
"I look forward to considering those as we reflect on what further action to take to support the Fair Trade movement in the weeks and months ahead."
"(DE) Mr President, fair trade is an issue not only in textiles, but also in energy."
"Russia's energy-intensive industries are currently being supplied with oil at 8 dollars per barrel, and gas is available at a very competitive price."
"With this in mind, how do you rate the chances for survival of our own energy-intensive industries, and what effect do you think this will have on Russia's accession to the WTO?"
"Member of the Commission."
"That is an intriguing question, one which certainly goes far wider than, and indeed probably almost entirely steps outside, the scope of the original question put to me."
"Nonetheless it is fascinating."
"I believe that the best way of improving, strengthening, deepening, making more satisfactory the energy demand and supply relationship between Europe and Russia is, first of all, to press Russia to adopt other, more transparent policies of free transit that are governed by global trade rules."
"I see no reason why energy goods should not be subject to global trade rules like any other good."
"But I also believe that the best way to strengthen the energy relationship between Russia and the EU is by anchoring that energy relationship in a wider set of trade negotiations and agreements, the object of which would be to bring about integration of the Russian and European economies governed by fair and transparent market rules and agreed norms and standards."
"It is in that context that I look forward to pursuing this subject as part of the wider trade negotiations that I hope will open up following Russia's accession to the WTO."
"Commissioner, one of the many obstacles to the development of Fair Trade is the occasional attempt by other countries to dump products within Europe on a below-cost basis, of which shoes was but the latest example."
"My question is not about how right or wrong the shoes decision is; it is about the process by which that decision is taken."
"I understand that 12 countries voted against, 9 voted in favour and there were 4 abstentions."
"Could you please comment on the logic of that process, Commissioner?"
"Member of the Commission."
"On 5 September 2006, I gave a full and comprehensive statement to Parliament on the state of play of the Doha Development Agenda."
"I am sorry to say that no major progress has been achieved since then; the negotiations remain suspended."
"However, it is important to note that since then, be it at the G-20 meeting in Rio, which I attended, or the Cairns Group meeting in Australia, where I was represented - both in September - all key players in the talks have reiterated their commitment to the Round and their willingness to resume negotiations as soon as the political circumstances allow."
"However, it will take more than that to get the DDA back on track."
"All sides will have to show flexibility and realism and make offers that represent real efforts in all areas of the negotiations."
"There is a narrow window of opportunity for resuming the talks between the United States mid-term elections on 7 November and early in the spring of 2007, when the US Congress starts working on a new farm bill."
"I visited Washington at the end of September to explore the US position on the DDA, to probe US congressional politics on the subject and to explain our position."
"I met with policymakers in the Administration, with a number of key law-makers on the Hill, and with constituencies like the National Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers."
"The political situation in the United States is difficult."
"However, I was encouraged by my contacts with the Administration, where I sensed a genuine willingness to conclude the Round during President Bush's tenure, although this will require the use of considerable political capital, even to get Congressional extension of the President's Trade Promotion Authority."
"So in the coming weeks our strategy must be to clarify the political conditions for renewing the talks and prepare the ground for movement - short of new offers."
"Our sights also remain firmly set on preserving the development issues, at this stage in the context of the Single Undertaking."
"If the DDA fails, or if the suspension is extended for too long a period of time, my firm judgement is that we run serious economic and political risks."
"There remains a lot on offer in the DDA in terms of agricultural subsidy reduction, tariff reductions for agricultural and industrial products, improved rules and development; and hence a great deal to lose if the talks fail."
"We should not underestimate the broader systemic implications of failure for the multilateral system at large."
"The DDA should therefore remain our main focus of attention - as it will - and the EU is willing and prepared to go back to the WTO negotiating table as soon as realistically possible."
"I have often said to you in this House that 5% of world trade is agricultural trade and the 95% is being blocked by the 5% at fair trade talks."
"Is it not time to remove the blockage?"
"Is it not time, Commissioner, to get on with the vast bulk of world trade and deal with agriculture on a separate level?"
"If you concede more on European agriculture, you will have broken the agreement that the Member States have made on agricultural subsidies and agricultural support."
"So is it not time to deal with the vast bulk of world trade and leave agriculture aside?"
"Member of the Commission."
"I do not accept that point of view, because I believe that we have a clear obligation, for objective reasons and because it was in the original Doha mandate, to bring about a negotiated and agreed restructuring of agricultural trade."
"We are obliged to do that because reform of agriculture has lagged behind the progressive changes that have swept through the rest of the international trading system, with that benign and beneficial impact on industrial tariffs."
"But in the case of agriculture you have, exceptionally, a system of agricultural support and in some cases export subsidies which has been very trade-distorting."
"As a result of our reforms in Europe we are curing ourselves of the trade-distorting impact of our agricultural support mechanisms."
"That is not the case, notably, in the United States."
"I believe it is important that we do not say goodbye to this round without exhausting every possibility of bringing about the progressive reform in agricultural support and trade that will be of great benefit to developing countries."
"Commissioner, are you concerned that the plethora of bilateral trade agreements - and I do not just mean EU bilateral trade agreements - that is growing up at the moment is a threat to getting the WTO talks back on track?"
"Member of the Commission."
"I do not think it is a threat, but I acknowledge the risk of a diversion of energy and negotiating capacity."
"There are always choices to be made by different countries and negotiators as to what form of negotiation they prioritise - the multilateral or the bilateral."
"But I am entirely satisfied that, given the long-term nature of the negotiations we are entering into and the clear sequencing of the initiatives we intend to take, there are no circumstances in which I would permit our own negotiating effort and commitment to the WTO to be diminished or jeopardised by any pursuit of bilateral free trade agreements."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to make a comment and ask a question."
"The insistence of third trading partners on agricultural negotiations continues to cause surprise, given the small volume of agricultural products traded globally."
"Does the Commissioner think that the emerging economies are truly prepared to contribute to this round of negotiations with fundamental commitments to industrial products and services or do they simply envisage unilateral disarmament on the part of the developed countries?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Sweden is currently one of the eleven Member States with derogations in relation to adopting the single currency."
"The Member States with derogations are obliged to adopt the euro as their currency, and to that end they must work towards meeting the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty."
"Nevertheless, the Treaty does not set explicit time limits for the Member States to comply with that obligation."
"In the 2004 convergence report, the Commission concluded that Sweden met the price stability criterion, the criterion relating to the public budget situation and the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates."
"Nevertheless, in that same convergence report, the Commission concluded that Sweden did not meet the exchange rate criterion, which requires the country in question to have remained within the normal margins of fluctuation laid down in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System without any serious tensions and for at least two years prior to the assessment."
"Furthermore, in the 2004 convergence report, the Commission pointed out that the Swedish legislation was not fully compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty."
"In view of this assessment, the Commission concluded that there was no need to modify Sweden's status as a Member State with a derogation in this area."
"In accordance with the Treaty, the Commission and the European Central Bank will publish the next convergence report before the end of this year."
"The new Member States have committed themselves to adopting the euro as soon as they comply with the criteria laid down in the Treaty."
"In this regard, Slovenia will enter the euro zone on 1 January 2007. Cyprus and Malta wish to join on 1 January 2008 and Slovakia on 1 January 2009, and other Member States, which had previously set specific targets, are in the process of revising them."
"In any event, as I said again at the beginning of my reply, with the exception of the two States with an opt-out clause - the United Kingdom and Denmark - the other Members of the European Union that have yet to adopt the single currency, and for which the derogation is in place, are obliged to adopt it and to work towards complying with the criteria, but there is no date by which they are obliged to have complied with them."
"(DE) Mr President, there are two more, and quite specific, items of information that I would welcome."
"The first is that I should like to know whether the Commission, when a Member State such as Sweden, without any arrangement being made for it in the Treaties, fails, for a period of years, to introduce the euro, will take legal action against it by, for example, taking it to the ECJ, or whether it will let the matter rest for another twenty years."
"Secondly, I would like to know what is happening about Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary."
"Is there any sign of any of them - Hungary in particular - actually doing anything?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr Posselt, we must not confuse the Member States' obligation to prepare for adoption of the single currency with the actions that the Commission and the Council may take - and are taking in fact - in relation to Member States that are not complying with the provisions of the Treaty, in the field of budgetary discipline, for example, as in the case of Hungary and other Member States."
"Preparations for adoption of the single currency relate to budgetary discipline, but also the stability of exchange rates and the development of interest rates, which is something decided upon by the markets according to the economic situation of the Member States."
"They also involve legal reforms, bringing the status of the Central Bank of the Member State in question into line with the rules laid down in the Treaty for the European System of Central Banks, and they also relate to the development of inflation."
"The factors for complying with the criteria for adoption of the single currency therefore depend partly on political decisions to be directly adopted by the governments or parliaments of the Member States, and partly on factors that are not always under the Member States' control."
"Consequently, although it will theoretically be possible in the future to apply infringement procedures to States that are not making preparations, we do not currently believe it to be necessary or even desirable."
"- (LT) Commissioner, if a wealthy and economically stable nation such as Sweden is unable to introduce the euro, I cannot but question the future of the euro zone project."
"It is evident that most of the current euro zone members are failing to meet one or more of the Maastricht criteria."
"For example, Lithuania has failed to meet the inflation criterion by 0.07%."
"How do you think the euro zone will develop in the future?"
"According to some forecasts, the euro will disappear in 15 years."
"What preventive measures should be taken?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mrs Budreikaitė, I do not believe that the future of the euro is in question. Not at all."
"A few years after its launch, in 1999, and five years after more than 300 million were able to carry it in their pockets for the first time in the form of coins and notes, the euro is now a reality which those who use it consider to be a success."
"In my view, therefore, the issue is not whether the euro has a future; the question is whether the countries that are not preparing properly for the adoption of the euro are going to suffer the consequences in the future."
"That is the real question."
"Each time I have contact with the authorities of the countries that are to adopt the euro in the future but which do not yet comply with the criteria laid down in the Treaty, I urge them to adopt a credible and effective strategy for complying with those criteria and adopting the single currency."
"For some years we have been enjoying abundant liquidity in the financial markets, interest rates are low and memories of monetary crises and volatile exchange rates are fading in Europe. There is no guarantee, however, that those situations that we saw in the past, before the existence of the euro, are not going to re-emerge in the future."
"Let us pray that they do not, but it could happen."
"We have seen 311 million Europeans enjoy the advantages of having a common currency, and we have also seen all of the Member States of the European Union enjoy the advantages of the fact that twelve of them have adopted the single currency."
"There are therefore more than enough reasons for the Member States that have yet to adopt the euro to be convinced that they must prepare and adopt economic policy decisions aimed at fulfilling these criteria and strengthening a currency which, seven years after its birth, is already the world's second largest currency."
"(SV) In a referendum, the people of Sweden rejected participation in economic and monetary union by a broad majority."
"Mr Posselt wants to ride roughshod over the result of a referendum."
"To do so is incompatible with a democratic view of the world."
"The Swedish economy has not been harmed by the fact that we are outside the single currency."
"I call on the Commissioner to state that he fully supports the result of the Swedish referendum and to distance himself from Mr Posselt's deplorable and undemocratic view of the world."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr Paleckis, on signing the Accession Treaty, the ten Member States that joined the Union in May 2004 agreed to adopt the euro as soon as they complied with the necessary conditions."
"These countries, and Sweden - which we have just discussed - are expected to implement policies in order to ensure compliance with those conditions."
"Nevertheless, as I said in my previous reply, the Accession Treaty does not set any time limit for achieving this."
"Many of the new Member States have adopted target dates and strategies for adopting the euro, thereby giving concrete form to their political commitment through firm convergence policies."
"Responsibility for implementing those policies lies with the Member States, for which the application of stability policies contributes to a broader objective than simply compliance with the convergence criteria for adoption of the single currency."
"Those policies are also necessary in order to guarantee high and sustained growth, as well as medium-term financial stability."
"Although the Commission supports the efforts of the Member States with derogations with regard to joining the euro zone, it is not possible to predict the pace at which that enlargement of that zone will take place."
"The Commission believes that achieving a high degree of sustainable convergence, in accordance with the Treaty, is a necessary condition in order to make the adoption of the euro a success, both for the current members of the zone, and for future members."
"I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive answer."
"You have recently been to Lithuania, which had an unhappy experience in its attempt to introduce the euro because its inflation was 0.07% above the target level."
"In your opinion, would it be better for Lithuania in future to think about joining the euro alone or in the company of the two other Baltic States - Latvia and Estonia?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr Paleckis, when, during the first half of this year, Lithuania, at the same time as Slovenia, asked the Commission and the European Central Bank to issue an opinion on their degree of compliance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty for membership of the Monetary Union, the Commission's response, which was subsequently backed by the Council, was unfortunately negative in the case of Lithuania and positive in the case of Slovenia."
"It was negative in the case of Lithuania because, at that time, that country did not comply with the inflation criterion."
"You have talked about the difference that existed at a particular time between Lithuania's average inflation over the last twelve months and the reference value, calculated in accordance with the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, with regard to the maximum inflation permissible for acceptance as a new member of the eurozone."
"It is true that the difference at that time was very small, less than 0.1%."
"Now, unfortunately, a few months later, with the latest data available, which has been published by Eurostat for September's inflation, Lithuania's average inflation over the last twelve months differs from the reference value by 0.7%; over just a few months it has multiplied by seven."
"As I was able to say to the Italian authorities on my recent visit to that country, the important thing now is not to discuss the small difference in the past; in my view, it is not even important to discuss firstly the date or conditions for entry."
"The important thing at the moment for Lithuania, and for the other Member States that wish to join the euro as soon as possible, is to decide what economic strategy and what measures, within a coherent economic policy strategy, must be adopted and implemented in order to comply with the Treaty's criteria."
"In view of the fact that average inflation in Lithuania has increasingly diverged from the maximum reference value, which currently stands at 2.8%, I urged the Lithuanian authorities to define that strategy and I once again offered the European Commission's cooperation in working jointly with the authorities of that Member State in the search for the best strategy, the most effective strategy, for bringing inflation under control without jeopardising Lithuania's excellent economic growth or the wonderful results that the Lithuanian economy has been achieving in many other respects."
"I believe that that is not just the attitude of the European Commission, but also of all of the Member States that want Lithuania to comply with the conditions as soon as possible and become a new member of the euro zone, as Slovenia will on 1 January."
"If Lithuania is accompanied by other Member States, the other Baltic States, then all the better."
"We cannot change the conditions for assessing whether or not the Treaty's conditions are met, however, regardless of how much we want our assessment of compliance with those criteria to be positive."
"Commissioner, you mentioned that Slovenia will be joining the eurozone on 1 January 2007, Malta and Cyprus in 2008, and Slovakia in 2009."
"During your recent visit to Lithuania, did you propose a clear date when Lithuania might join the eurozone?"
"And have you already received an action plan from the Government, including the fight against corruption?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) The only definite date is 1 January 2007 for Slovenia, although it is the case that, in June, the European Council supported the Commission's proposal and the Ecofin Council confirmed that Lithuania complies with almost all of the conditions for joining the euro zone."
"I said in my reply that Cyprus and Malta want to be members of the euro zone from 1 January 2008, but the analysis and assessment of compliance with the criteria has yet to be made."
"I also said in my reply that Slovakia wants to be a member of the euro zone from 1 January 2009, and at the appropriate time we will have to assess whether or not it meets the conditions."
"In our next convergence report, which will be adopted by the Commission and presented to this Parliament in December, we shall assess the extent to which, at this precise moment, the derogation countries comply with the conditions."
"Nevertheless, the Member State in question must comply with the conditions prior to the date on which it wishes to join the euro zone."
"The Lithuanian authorities had a target date and they must now set a new date."
"When I visited Lithuania in September, that date had not been decided upon."
"As far as I know, they have not set a date since my visit."
"I have insisted to the Lithuanian authorities, and to the authorities of other States in a similar position, that they have the strategy before the date, because, without a strategy, the dates decided upon will have to be modified over time, since the decision on the date, in itself, is not sufficient to satisfy the criteria that are going to be required."
"Commissioner, I fully support what you say about candidate countries meeting the convergence criteria."
"But do you accept that it is very frustrating for them to be struggling to meet those criteria and, at the same time, to see existing Member States of the eurozone systematically breaching their obligations?"
"I know you have raised this issue with the Council."
"But what efforts will you continue to make to ensure that existing eurozone Member States meet their legal requirements?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr Mitchell, the Commission does not expect the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union to have immediate effects on the composition of the euro zone."
"Following their accession, on 1 January, both countries will take part in the Economic and Monetary Union as Member States, with derogations, and they will participate fully in the multilateral supervision of economic policies, as laid down in the Treaty, just like the Member States of the Union that do not belong to the euro zone."
"From the date of their accession to the European Union, and since they will not be members of the euro zone and will not have an opt-out clause, Bulgaria and Romania will have to work towards complying with the convergence criteria with a view to being able to adopt the euro in the future."
"For the other Member States of the euro zone, however, I cannot see any immediate effect whatsoever apart from the very positive fact that the Union will have two new Member States."
"Thank you for taking the question."
"I agree with the Commissioner that the euro has guaranteed transparency in pricing and facilitated travel and above all, having one currency has created a greater unity of purpose for Europeans than anything else we have done together."
"All that is to be welcomed."
"I understand that the European economy seems to be cooling, but is still expected to grow by 2.5% in 2006, its biggest growth since 2000."
"That is to be applauded, but slowing global growth and increased interest rates mean that European economic growth might be hindered."
"Can the Commissioner tell the House if he anticipates any more changes in economic growth after the impending enlargement and indicate what effect that will have?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr Mitchell, it is true that the euro zone, and the European Union as a whole, is also showing growth in 2006, and we are seeing the beginning of clear economic recovery."
"Despite this economic recovery, however, we are still seeing growth figures that are lower than those expected when the economic and monetary union entered the third phase and, to a certain degree, some people are trying to establish a relationship between that low growth, compared to other areas of the world economy, and the existence of the single currency or the existence of the economic and monetary union itself."
"I believe that the most rigorous analyses, not just those by the Commission, but also those by other institutions outside of the European Union, come to the conclusion, like us, that the obstacles to growth in Europe and, in particular, in the most significant economies of the eurozone, are basically, fundamentally, of a structural nature."
"Hence, we must place the emphasis not only on respect for the operating rules and the rules on budgetary discipline or on the independence of the European Central Bank in the shaping of the economic and monetary union, but also on growth policies of a structural nature, which are what we call, in our jargon, the Lisbon Strategy policies."
"It appears that what our economies need is a combination of healthy macroeconomic policies, geared toward stability, and ambitious structural reform policies."
"From that point of view, enlargement, the arrival of ten new Members in May 2004, has been a spur, an incentive and a positive stimulus for the European economies as a whole."
"A few months ago, in May 2006, coinciding with the second anniversary of the arrival of ten new Member States, the Commission published, under my responsibility, a communication on the economic consequences of enlargement."
"Our assessment of the economic consequences of enlargement has been very positive; very positive for the new Member States and also for the old ones, for the European Union of fifteen, because, amongst other things, the new Member States are, generally speaking, showing a greater capacity for implementing structural reforms and making the necessary structural changes."
"It is true that they are starting from a less advanced situation."
"They have also introduced dynamism, positive pressure, which is also encouraging economies of the former European Union of fifteen to speed up the implementation of structural policies."
"In fact, I believe that some of the positive impacts of structural reforms aimed at greater growth may be coming to light during this recovery phase."
"It is still too soon to judge the extent to which the improvements in productivity being recorded during the first two quarters of this year are exclusively due to factors linked to the economic cycle."
"The European Central Bank tends to put practically all of the increase in productivity recorded over recent quarters down to the economic cycle, but I believe that there are certain indications that the structural reforms that have been adopted over recent years and whose pace is beginning to speed up as a result of the positive impact of enlargement are also beginning to play a positive role in this improvement in productivity."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"""Youth in Action"" programme (2007-2013) (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (06236/3/2006 C6-0273/2006 for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council creating the 'Youth in Action' programme for the period 2007-2013 (Rapporteur: Mrs Gröner)."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of Members present in this plenary is certainly no indication of the importance of this issue, and the 'Youth in Action' programme for the period from 2007 to 2013 is certainly a milestone for our young European fellow-citizens."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their very constructive cooperation."
"At first reading stage, we worked through 58 amendments, most of which found their way into the draft, and it is through this result of informal negotiations that we now arrive at the Common Position, which we are able to accept and on which we are able to agree at second reading."
"Working both with and for young people aged between 15 and 18, the perhaps some 170 million citizens who are the European Union's primary concern, all three institutions have endeavoured to find a solution that makes Europe real for them, that helps to make the programme less bureaucratic and makes access to it easier for disadvantaged young people."
"We have, with this programme, had a number of general objectives in mind."
"First among them is the fostering of citizenship."
"We want to make it easier for young people to work together as members of society while also offering them the opportunity to cooperate at European level, thereby, among other things, overcoming voter apathy and awakening in them an interest in politics."
"Secondly, we want to promote solidarity and tolerance among young people, particularly as a means towards greater social cohesion in the EU."
"In this way, it will be possible for young people, together, to develop new lifestyles and models of coexistence."
"We want to promote mutual understanding between young people and the multicultural diversity that we in Europe treasure."
"We also want to promote systems for supporting youth organisations and young people's civil society organisations and cohesion among young people even beyond Europe's borders."
"It is with those purposes in mind that we have negotiated a budget of EUR 885 million."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I have proposed the submission of minimum budgets for the following five headings."
"Of the funding available, 30% is to go to the traditional youth exchange 'Youth for Europe'."
"The object of 'European Voluntary Service' is involvement, for a period of between two and twelve months, in non-profit-making activity for the common good in a country other than one's own, and this project is to receive 23% of the funds."
"'Youth for the World' is a new project intended to awaken understanding of other peoples in a spirit of openness, which is very important at various levels, and to which 6% of overall resources are to be allocated."
"The 'support systems for youth' are to receive at least 15%; by this is meant the European Youth Forum and the network of youth organisations and persons active in this field whom it supports."
"It is intended that 4% of the funds should go to support European cooperation among young people, which would amount to the dividing up of 76% of the sectors, and that would offer the Commission sufficient flexibility to become more actively involved where necessary."
"Facing up to challenges is the right approach."
"We have the funds to support the special project 'European Youth Week', and we want the Pact for European Youth, concluded by the Council in 2005, to come alive."
"It cannot be acceptable that we should look on and do nothing while disorder breaks out among young people and while young people in the European Union lack jobs and prospects."
"We must ensure that young people have something to look forward to, and we want the Member States to give these projects their wholehearted support, for we cannot deal with the problem on our own."
"I am therefore appealing to the Member States to get stuck in."
"I recommend that this House agree to the compromise we have arrived at and adopt the Common Position unamended."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, it is not very often that we feel such a strong consensus as we do now."
"I should like to express my gratitude to those who made it possible, as it is not automatic."
"I am sure that this consensus makes it probable that in the coming weeks we will be able to adopt, in the full sense of the legal term, the Youth in Action Programme."
"I should especially like to thank Mrs Gröner, the rapporteur for the programme, as well as the Committee on Culture and Education, which dealt with matters in a very constructive manner during the procedure."
"I extend my thanks to the committee and its chairman, Mr Sifunakis, for their support."
"This consensus and progress in the work will allow full continuity between the current Youth Programme and the next one, so that there will be no interruption."
"This is a very different case from the previous one seven years ago, when there was a significant suspension in the Youth Programme for several months."
"The new programme is a partial but important response to the Union's priorities: citizenship, growth and peace."
"Firstly, in terms of citizenship, it will enable young Europeans to affirm themselves as supportive, responsible, active and tolerant citizens in pluralist societies."
"Getting young people more involved in the field and the life of local, national and European communities and fostering active citizenship represents an important challenge for our societies."
"There is also a need to enhance young people's awareness of the fact that they belong to Europe and to develop their sense of European citizenship."
"Secondly, it is equally necessary to respond to the aspirations of young people by providing them with the opportunity to enrich their education and training on a less formal level."
"Non-formal educational activities deserve to be supported and recognised at European level because they contribute to European growth."
"That is why I am very happy that we will have more space for voluntary service in Europe."
"Lastly, young people's willingness to develop new relations between young Europeans and young people all over the world, their concern for mutual understanding, a spirit of tolerance and openness are important contributions towards world peace."
"Progress in the negotiations on this programme was subject to the agreement on the financial perspectives last May."
"Following the adoption of this budgetary framework and the decision to allocate EUR 885 million, at current prices, to the Youth in Action Programme, the institutions have shown their capacity to react quickly and constructively to have a new programme adopted without any further delay."
"I believe that is a very strong message to young people sent by the European institutions today."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation in relation to the Common Position incorporates numerous amendments made by this House at first reading."
"Although, as Mrs Gröner has just said, the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 provides EUR 885 million for the 'Youth in Action' programme on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective for the same period, I would nevertheless like to remind the House that the amount envisaged in the Commission's original proposal was EUR 913 million, and, this House having demanded an increase to EUR 1.1 billion, we have now, in the Common Position, ended up with EUR 885 million."
"While that may well not reflect what we aspired to, it does give us the security to plan ahead for the coming years, and it is good that we can adopt it in this form today or tomorrow."
"'Youth in Action' is primarily aimed at young people between the ages of 15 and 28, although some projects are open to 13-year olds and 30-year olds."
"My group is glad that this House has been able to take the initiative in highlighting such important aspects of the Common Position as, for example, young people's participation in democratic life, the promotion of such fundamental values as human dignity, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, protection for participants by means of proper insurance - which is a very important consideration - the European Youth Weeks, seminars and structured dialogues involving young people, exchange schemes for young people in Europe and the neighbouring countries and, not least, EUR 2 million in financial support for the European Youth Forum."
"While thanking Mrs Gröner, I would also like to say that we hope that the unamended Common Position of the Council will meet with widespread support from this House tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at times when we find ourselves debating the demographic challenges of the twenty-first century, the young people rioting in France and more and more people supporting nationalist parties, it is enormously important that young people be involved in working towards an understanding of other cultures and outlooks and thereby creating the conditions for greater solidarity in Europe."
"In particular, young people who do not or cannot become mobile through programmes such as Erasmus, Comenius or Leonardo within the context of formal education need a change to gain useful experience of intercultural dialogue, and there needs to be more recognition of the role and importance of informal education in this respect."
"I am convinced of the rightness of prioritising, within the programme, the 'Youth for Europe' project, which campaigns for youth exchanges and young people's initiatives."
"We should also invite the European Youth Forum to make regular presentations on its work to the committee, so that all Members may learn from its valuable work and benefit from it."
"A very wide variety of problems were raised in discussions with youth organisations, including the different procedures for the issue of visas and the failure to reflect on why those differences are there; my request is that young people be more involved in these."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to welcome Mrs Gröner's report and the common position on which we have been able to agree."
"I am glad that young people in the countries bordering the European Union - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the countries of the North Caucasus - will be able to benefit from the new programme as soon as next year."
"European Union membership has a positive influence on many aspects of life in the Member States."
"Young people, with their present and future challenges and problems, are no exception to this."
"The 75 million young people who live in the European Union are lucky in many ways."
"They have freedom of movement, opportunities to study and work in various European Union countries, to improve their foreign language skills, participate in intercultural exchange, and so on."
"Nevertheless, the above advantages are at the same time also the challenges and tasks that are faced and need to be resolved by the increasingly ageing population of today's Europe."
"My reference to an ageing Europe is not just incidental; it is a reference to the fact that we must be clearly aware and not underestimate the importance of young people; we must make every effort to actively involve them in the political and developmental processes of the European Union."
"Implementation of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy is overemphasised as a factor of great importance to young people; we, nevertheless, must not forget that young people themselves play a very significant role in implementing these objectives."
"Investing in young people is one of the cornerstones of pursuing more rapid development and increasing the level of employment in Europe."
"It is, of course, very important for the Member States themselves to give the Council's recommendations proper support and take specific actions."
"We know a great many examples of good programmes, and yet many of them have not been fully implemented."
"This requires closer dialogue and cooperation between young people and politicians at both the national and European level."
"We must treat young people as a source of positive energy, and not as a burden."
"Our objective is to strengthen the trust of young people in the objectives of this important European institution and the Member States in order to eliminate any doubt as regards the broadly declared role of young people in the growth, development and stability of the European Union."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Gröner for the work she has done on this report."
"All of us are convinced that Europe is meant to be an opportunity for young people to be able to move around freely within it, broadening their horizons and learning several languages, improving their education and training and, all in all, becoming trustworthy and responsible people in an open European society."
"It is, of course, also important that Europe should gain acceptance among young people."
"We need to remind ourselves that it will be the young people who will build Europe up and ensure its future development, in other words that what matters above all is that they should find out for themselves what they want Europe to become in future."
"This task of improving opportunities for young people will not be capable of being performed in isolation from other policy areas, among which economic policy is quite central, as also are educational and social policy, together with the Lisbon Strategy issues to which reference has just been made."
"I would very much like to see us taking this policy area seriously rather than neglecting it, for young people are the key to Europe's future."
"- (SL) The 'Youth in Action' report is very important in strengthening European awareness and European citizenship amongst young people."
"We all know that our citizens sometimes find it difficult to identify with the European dimension, and that European institutions far away in Brussels seem rather remote to them."
"Through this report we have sought ways of making European citizenship more tangible by promoting solidarity, initiative and creativity."
"Because young people are most receptive to new ideas, we have focused on young people between 13 and 30 years of age."
"Young people are increasingly taking responsible positions in politics, and it is right that we should secure for them the tools and conditions which will also direct their attention towards Europe's common objective."
"Of the five actions envisaged by this programme, let me highlight the second: 'European Voluntary Service'."
"Voluntary work is of great importance for the development and future of society."
"It contributes to the development of existing systems, cohesive values, social progress and other developments in society, and therefore needs to be promoted and given due recognition."
"Young people active in this area set a shining example thereby, especially to a consumer society which is far too preoccupied with money and personal fulfilment, yet all too little concerned about people around us whose lives could be vastly improved with just a little bit of effort."
"Politics is also a kind of voluntary work, at least when you are starting out."
"When most of us were young, voluntary work was the quickest route into politics."
"I support this report and I hope that young people will be able to benefit as much as possible from aspiring to and meeting the ideals contained within it, for the sake of their own personal growth and the benefit of society."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, for her excellent work on this report."
"I am sure we all agree that young people are vital to shaping the future of Europe."
"I do not believe that we should concentrate on debating whether young people should be supported through EU programmes."
"There is clear evidence that programmes for young people and students are the best path of EU action for true integration at the citizen level."
"Nevertheless I should like to raise a few points."
"First of all, the budget allocated for the programme still seems to be insufficient."
"I know the hard work the Commissioner has done, but I still hope that in the final budget for the future years we could see improved numbers."
"Secondly, I strongly support lowering the age to 13."
"Providing opportunities at a young age encourages initiative in later years."
"I do not think that 13 is too young to participate in 'Youth in Action'."
"Something else that would enhance the programme is the expansion of the list of countries with which youth organisations can cooperate, to include as many countries as possible."
"Countries such as China and Russia are key players in world politics and economics."
"Forming close ties with those countries at an early age can only be beneficial."
"Another factor to consider is the importance of enhanced mobility."
"It would be a vital step to ease the current visa regulations in countries outside the Schengen Agreement."
"Far too often student exchanges, 'work abroad' programmes and school trips have to be cancelled because of the difficulty in obtaining visas."
"Sometimes the complicated procedures and high prices even discourage starting a project."
"To ease that situation I call for standardised documentation in all EU countries for obtaining visas."
"We should also try to support the 'Get Visible' campaign, which suggests a separate visa type for NGO representatives."
"That would significantly enhance the possibility of young people participating in volunteer work programmes, exchange programmes and youth organisation work."
"The Youth in Action Programme will end in 2013."
"It would be short-sighted of me to say that that will be time enough."
"However, it is a good start."
"I truly thank you, Commissioner, for all your hard work on this issue."
"Member of the Commission."
"(SK) I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate, which will continue, in a somewhat different way, during subsequent phases, especially when it comes to implementing the programme."
"I think the consensus is evident."
"I do not want to speak or respond at length, but I consider it very important that the intensity and level of cooperation and commitment regarding young people in the EU is growing, not only in response to demographic issues but also in response to the overall prospects for European cooperation, solidarity and integration."
"The European Pact for Youth was adopted recently, several years after the White Paper."
"We now have a chance to launch a new programme for young people that would provide improvements in terms of both quantity and quality."
"This is very important because, among other things, the age bracket has been widened and the budget has grown significantly."
"Naturally, we have proposed more, but this issue should also be viewed in terms of the limits and scope of the financial perspective."
"In addition, the programme of life-long learning and the programme of citizenship or civic cooperation, along with certain external programmes and actions of the Community, clearly offer increasing opportunities for young people."
"For example, I have been in Canada, working on a bilateral agreement between the EU and Canada that will cover not only university cooperation but also the area of young people."
"These specific lines of cooperation with partnership countries in the area of young people are multiplying and growing."
"I firmly believe that they will bear fruit."
"Thirdly, it is very important not just to formulate policies for young people, but to do it together with young people, as this will be more effective, more successful and more mature in terms of civil society in the common Europe of the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Annex - Commission statement"
"The Commission should like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ."
"This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with."
"For the Youth in Action programme, the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 885 million."
"Action programme in the field of lifelong learning (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (06237/3/2006 C6-0274/2006 establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning. (Rapporteur: Mrs Pack)."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the new 'lifelong learning' programme was intended to be a sufficient response, within the framework of the Lisbon process, to the challenges of the present day, for education - as we all, together with everyone else, constantly affirm - is the be-all and end-all of our countries' joint efforts at coming out top in globalised competition."
"The Council's cuts in the general budget have also had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back."
"The Commissioner has had no hand in these cutbacks."
"He was on our side, fighting for more."
"It is regrettable that the Member States did not want that."
"The final figure we arrived at was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but, following negotiations, we have been left with no more and no less than EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective."
"Even so, I want to thank all those Members who fought successfully and made it possible for us, together, to achieve a EUR 800 million increase in the funds originally allocated to this programme in the Financial Perspective."
"So much for the lofty goals and the bumpy return to earth."
"The 'lifelong learning' programme is founded on the two programmes 'Socrates' and 'Leonardo', develops them further and enables working in synergy."
"We have learned from the latest programmes; our countries' various national agencies have acquainted us with the problems that they had with the programmes, and their views have all, in fact, been taken into account."
"The 'lifelong learning' programme includes the 'Comenius' programme for schools, its university counterpart 'Erasmus', the 'Leonardo' programme for vocational education and the 'Grundvigh' for adults, the 'Jean Monnet' schemes for promoting European integration and horizontal measures."
"I have pushed for more funds than originally planned by the Commission to be allocated to the Comenius programme on the grounds that it is, in my view, the basis for all the other educational programmes, and I have also emphasised the need for more cooperation in the border regions through a new 'Comenius Regio'."
"The programme puts new emphasis on student mobility between the ages of 11 and 16, with the invaluable experience of a school year spent at a school elsewhere in the EU."
"We have also taken account in it of the needs of the children of migratory workers."
"The Leonardo programme promotes workers' mobility and partnerships in ways that were formerly possible only through Erasmus."
"Grants payable under Erasmus to university students are being increased to EUR 200 per month, since the former grant was scarcely enough to live on; we had originally proposed EUR 300, but that could have been sustained only by a drastic reduction in the number of participants, and so we had to abandon the idea."
"Erasmus also covers preparatory language courses and travel grants."
"Better financial provision than before has been made for the Grundvigh programme, under which individual exchanges are now available."
"The programme is conceived as a response to the current state of the labour market and to population trends."
"Whilst continuing to make grants to the College of Europe in Bruges, the European University Institute in Florence, the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht and the European Law Academy in Trier, Parliament has also made provision for special grants to the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, Middelfart, and the Centre Internationale de la Formation Européenne in Nice."
"I am absolutely delighted that participation in these programmes is still open to all members of the EEA and to Switzerland and Turkey, and that the countries of the Western Balkans have recently been invited to join in; that leads me to highlight the fact that it is now high time, to say the least, that the easier visa arrangement for South-Eastern Europe took tangible form."
"I would like to sum up by saying that the 'lifelong learning' programme will help improve the EU's educational and training programmes, make people more mobile, support partnerships and cooperative efforts between regions, structure the sharing of best practice and encourage the learning of foreign languages."
"This is a programme that will help people gain a better understanding of the European Union, make it easier for them to live together in it and practice intercultural dialogue and tolerance; it is, in fact the best communications strategy in the EU."
"Member of the Commission. Mr President, as our German friends say, Bildung ist mehr - education is more."
"It is a key to many more answers in life than are possible without education, and it empowers individuals and societies to seek a better economic, social, cultural and political future; and that is why I am sure that an integrated lifelong learning programme could provide many new opportunities in quantitative and qualitative terms, because when we see it in combination with what we are doing in Europe all together, it means much more than just a programme."
"We are agreeing to create the lifelong learning strategies in Member States by the end of this year."
"We have a programme from January 2007, and we have a benchmark in our cooperation, in order to increase the participation of adults in the lifelong learning systems in Member States."
"As Mrs Pack said, lifelong learning is not a luxury, it is a necessity; and I am sure that it gives individuals experiences which enrich their lives and improve their employability."
"Learning helps institutions to transfer knowledge from one to another across Europe, to innovate, to improve and to modernise."
"It increases the transparency of Member States' systems, because when cooperation is open, we see how systems are moving and becoming more and more compatible."
"In short, it is a valuable European instrument at the direct service of our citizens."
"The new programme will expand opportunities and will, I am sure, bring even more benefits."
"So I am delighted that Parliament, the Council and the Commission were able, almost as soon as the financial framework was finalised earlier this year, to reach agreement on the text of the programme decision."
"I know it was not easy, but if Parliament adopts it without amendment, as your rapporteur proposes, then the programme can be implemented on time from the start of 2007."
"Given the complexity of the programme, that is a major achievement."
"If we compare the past with the current complex programme, we can see the hard work that has been done."
"I would like to extend particular thanks to Mrs Pack, the rapporteur, for using her great expertise and experience in the field to make it possible to reach an agreement so rapidly at second reading."
"On the text itself, the Commission is fully in agreement that it should not be amended."
"The financial envelope will be close to EUR 7 billion for seven years at current prices. But we should also see it in broader terms, where opportunities are growing."
"I do not want to go into details, but I frequently encourage ministers to look into structural funds to see how they could serve the mobility of students; how other programmes like Erasmus Mundus could also help to build a more attractive European educational space."
"Our services have been working at full speed to have the implementation arrangements in place so that we can publish the first call for proposals under the lifelong learning programme before the end of this year, and to ensure that the programme is more accessible and simpler for the end user."
"Thank you for providing the possibility of enabling us to be so advanced at this moment."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is, of course, a good thing that we can give the green light to these important learning programmes, for, as you so rightly say, Bildung ist mehr, education is more."
"Nevertheless, I, like the rapporteur, have mixed feelings."
"As Mrs Pack said before me, I would argue that the Member States should never have cut back on these programmes - not as drastically, at any rate, as has now been the case."
"These are programmes that can help us make young people into European citizens, the Europeans of the future."
"Why ever have we been so brutal in the cutbacks for those programmes?"
"That is extremely short-sighted and in any event a missed opportunity for the EU's future."
"I think that the Member States have given a perfect illustration of how to queer one's own pitch."
"I am sure that the Commissioner will agree with me when I say that every Erasmus student, every Comenius student - and I have met a huge number over the years - every student ends up having a life-forming experience."
"It broadens their horizons, improves their chances of employment, brings them into contact with others, they experience diversity and learn how to deal with it."
"In that way, these programmes also contribute to tolerance and, needless to say, to European citizenship."
"This House should, in actual fact, have thrown out this limited budget, but that is a different matter, of course."
"It should have done that not least with social reasons in mind, for quite a few students who come from more socially vulnerable environments and backgrounds will now find it much more difficult to take part in Erasmus."
"There is no point, though, as somebody already said, in regretting past actions. It is too late for that."
"We now have to pull out all the stops to make the most of what we have."
"I think that schools are sufficiently creative in seeking, and finding, additional sources of income to fund those programmes."
"Industry, possibly backed by the European Union or national governments, may be able to help."
"Why could businesses not sponsor exchange projects?"
"A factory that is local to me - Ford - could, for example, invite final-year pupils or students for visits to their sister factories in different countries across the border."
"It is just a thought, but there may be some scope there."
"It is crucially important that we promote the exchange of students and schools to the best of our ability."
"I would, at this early stage, express the hope that the Council and the Member States will realise that cutbacks on the forthcoming multi-annual programme are bound to leave their mark on programmes like these, and I wish you, Commissioner, the very best in your endeavours to implement the next programme 2007-2013."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we are making today a really big day for culture, with five very major programmes for us to debate and also vote on, which is not the sort of thing that happens very often in this House."
"It does, however, highlight the importance and necessity of getting programmes of this kind up and running."
"Taken all together, little more than one per cent of the total European Budget for 2007 to 2013 is available to us for all five programmes - education, youth, culture, media and active citizenship - and that puts everything back into perspective and also brings us down to earth a bit."
"I would like to say that these are ambitious programmes, and we certainly could have done with more financial support for them; as has already been said, we had all planned something bigger, and it is the Member States that are standing in the way."
"In general terms, though, I do believe that the 'lifelong learning' programme is aimed in the right direction, with simplification, lump sums and more decentralisation in line with what we demanded."
"Expenditure must be proportionate to financial support, and building in the other EU support programmes on a horizontal basis would have been something else worth aiming for, but I would also appeal to the Commission for things to be made simpler for the national agencies and for the applicants too."
"The national agencies are in the course of being restructured, and this process will certainly take up more time yet, but here, too, dialogue and support from the Commission are called for."
"We, too, should apply ourselves more to dialogue, for there are still a number of problems left to be resolved."
"It is to be hoped that the trend towards increasing mobility will continue, for we have set ourselves the target of three million students by 2012, and so we must make further strenuous efforts and demand many improvements."
"The school systems also need to be analysed in terms of quality, which needs to be guaranteed not only by the EU, but also by the Member States, and we have to demand that they do that."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack for an excellent report."
"Lifelong learning is an integral part of any modern and developing society, since the wellbeing of the nation is based on the education, experience and skill that its population acquires."
"In many cases the level of literacy and education determines a person's health and wellbeing, as well as being a source of income and providing better opportunities for participation in social, political and cultural life."
"At the moment, adult education, training and the professional development of working people are becoming increasingly important in Lithuania, just as they are in the European Union as a whole, although it has not yet become a hard and fast rule."
"Unfortunately, according to 2004 data, our country is lagging far behind the EU average in terms of continuing education of people in the age range of 24-65 years - 28% in Lithuania as opposed to 42% in the European Union."
"Many of the residents of our country agree that the main reasons motivating people to study are constantly growing labour market requirements and better self-improvement and self-expression opportunities; however, for half of our citizens their age has become a barrier, as they believe they are too old to study."
"Lithuania still holds on to a negative attitude towards older people pursuing knowledge."
"In some cases, in fact, particular social groups are being discriminated against."
"In fact, the attitude that only a competent employee is able to achieve good results, contribute to the competitive advantage of the company and, most importantly, to gain a feeling of personal value and self-confidence, is already becoming dominant."
"However, it is generally public institutions rather than private employers, who pay most attention to the training of their employees."
"This is a huge problem, since private companies employ almost 70% of all workers."
"Constantly developing technologies and competitive challenges call for qualified employees, and this must be an on-going process."
"Consequently, funding becomes an extremely important issue."
"I believe that this programme and the aid from the European Union Structural Funds will help in reducing the present differences between the various Member States and the lifelong learning strategy will actually be implemented."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, will start by thanking Mrs Pack for the superb job she has done with this report."
"That she is one of this House's really experienced experts on educational policy has already been mentioned, and that is evident from the priorities and emphases that she has added to this report."
"Europe is lacking in raw materials - that much is a fact - and so it is all the more important that we should develop the potential in the people who live here."
"The growth achieved by both China and India is extraordinary, and so is the number of graduates they produce."
"If Europe is to stand a chance in the globalised economy, we have to do more for education, research and development."
"I do not actually think that the European budget is focussed on the future; we are still investing too much in traditional agricultural polices and too little in education, development and research."
"Previous speakers have already lamented the fact that we are, in this area, budgeting for too little overall, with the derisory figure of one per cent over the next seven years."
"I find that very disappointing;"
"I really would have liked to see more."
"We should be aiming at enabling every student in Europe to participate in the Erasmus programme, which represents the big opportunity for young people, for the experience of studying in different Member States will make real Europeans of them; they will derive lifelong benefit from what they learn there and, of course, carry it over into their circles of friends and acquaintances and into working life."
"That is what makes these experiences so very valuable, not only to them as individuals, but also to society."
"EUR 200 is, of course, preferable to EUR 150, but it is not exactly what we could do with if we are to have a pro-active education policy."
"I do, though, think Mrs Pack was right to say that we should start with the young and invest more in them."
"All the studies show that to be the case."
"That is why spending more on Comenius, within the context of lifelong learning, is the right thing to do."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome Mrs Pack's multi-layered approach to drawing up this report."
"I should like to highlight just a few aspects of the issue."
"One of the dangers of the modern world is that people are unable to adapt dynamically because of the narrowly focused and overly specialised nature of education, which gives them a limited worldview and stops them from achieving their potential in the labour market."
"The world has changed such a great deal that the traditional ideas of getting an education once and once only, guaranteeing long-term employment and continuous progress until retirement, has gone for good."
"People must be capable of reacting more quickly to the way in which their environment is evolving, and individual European educational programmes should enable them to do this."
"Lifelong learning helps people to keep pace with the development of science and technology and makes it easier for them to understand the world in general."
"Alongside the development of educational programmes, it is necessary to focus on ensuring that lifelong learning is not just a luxury for the chosen few but is accessible to all sections of society, regardless of social status and gender."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the purpose of this decision is for Parliament and the Council to set up an integrated programme in the field of lifelong learning, to be implemented in the years 2007-2013."
"Amongst other things, the programme aims to develop international cooperation between institutions of higher education and schools, and also to promote the mobility of students, staff, pupils and teachers."
"The programme is composed of four sectoral programmes, namely Comenius for schools, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci for vocational education and training and Grundtvig for adult education."
"The original version of the programme's budget has been cut."
"This has entailed cuts in terms of the quantitative targets for individual components of the programme and also the percentage share of resources."
"As less funding is now available, many of the actions previously planned will now not be undertaken."
"These include fostering long and short-term mobility of teachers within the framework of Erasmus, along with study visits and innovative and experimental projects within the framework of the inter-sectoral programme."
"Pursuant to the provisions of the new 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, the budget allocation for the implementation of the lifelong learning programme has been almost halved."
"It has been cut from the EUR 13.62 billion originally planned to EUR 7.171 billion."
"This reduction in the programme's budget implies that there will be fewer grants available for projects and that there will also be fewer opportunities for poorer students to study at foreign institutions."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank Mrs Pack very much for all her work."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the lifelong learning programme is an excellent venture, and the aims enshrined in its provisions are all relevant."
"This programme is intended to implement one of the pillars of the Union, namely the common social policy."
"However, as has been the case with similar excellent ventures, the programme has fallen prey to funding cuts."
"One of the provisions of this programme involves supporting the contribution of learning to social cohesion, which should lead to improved relationships between societies in our Community."
"I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, how can this be brought about when the new Member States are still bound by the transitional periods set for access to the labour market, and therefore denied equal access to knowledge and technology?"
"Another key aim is also undermined, namely that of increasing competitiveness, mobility and innovation in the aforementioned market."
"How can there be talk of such values when there is no mutual recognition of the equivalence of final diplomas, thus putting individuals at a disadvantage at the very start of their career?"
"In conclusion, I would point out that, once again, a splendid and noble programme is deemed worthwhile and its provisions and aims are implemented mainly in the countries of the old Union."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Pack has acted as the driving force behind the development of the programmes that we are discussing today, with the integrated action programme."
"Without her passion, we would never have made the progress that we have made."
"Erasmus is certainly the most popular programme."
"Despite the financial increase, the new version will still depend on general mobility conditions such as the transferability of grants, social security and the recognition of qualifications, too."
"While mobility does not guarantee that a person's studies will be integrated into his or her curriculum vitae, taking the Erasmus route means that he or she is likely to have to study for an extra year."
"Commissioner, I should like to ask you where in the Bologna process is the inclusion of an Erasmus year?"
"As regards the Leonardo programme, the mobility of employees undertaking vocational training is of prime concern to the craft-based industries and small and medium-sized enterprises, which also need to be made aware of mobility-related issues."
"Making our workforce mobile: that is what the Leonardo programme could do."
"To that end, the Commission should embark on campaigns to raise the awareness of businesses and should also ensure that the available budget is actually spent."
"I should like to point out that our ancestors used readily to move around."
"Artists and craftsmen were the ones who travelled the most; it was they who moved society forward."
"Cross-border trade is the best way to make our fellow citizens forget about borders and to prove that we can do better."
"Finally, I shall not stop repeating, Commissioner, that, given the importance that Mr Barroso attaches to culture, we should have the courage to make it a European policy."
"Indeed, those who want a larger budget must be able to submit political projects that are important and that are recognised as being important."
"A revival of the debate on the best means of taking the Commission forward would provide a good opportunity for us to speak loudly in favour of such a policy."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on her good work, and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, whose contributions have enriched this text."
"I would also, however, like to communicate my concern with regard to the implementation of the lifelong learning programme."
"I remember how, at the outset, we were all falling over ourselves to improve the system of student mobility in Europe."
"We all voted in favour of increasing the funds for the Erasmus, Leonardo, Comenius programmes etc., in the conviction that it was a very productive long-term investment."
"Providing the participants with economic facilities and, at the same time, simplifying the process for being awarded grants, brought us closer to the objectives set in the Lisbon Strategy."
"As time passes, however, I am finding it harder to remain optimistic."
"I note from surveys that fifteen-year-old European schoolchildren have poor reading skills and show a high level of truancy and that many young people do not complete their studies within the time set."
"In view of this information, I wonder how we are going to deal with the challenges of globalisation."
"If we are to create a knowledge-based society, sustainable economic development and greater social cohesion, we will have to establish a strong foundation from the outset, and that can only be achieved through effective education."
"In short, in order to deal with future challenges, it is crucial that we invest more in education."
"It is possible to improve the way existing programmes operate and to create new programmes."
"If we make the effort, the numbers will gradually prove us to be right, but all of us must try to convince the Member States that we need to dedicate more money to education and training."
"- (LT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to re-emphasise that the programme being discussed provides citizens with more favourable opportunities for on-going training and becoming active participants of the knowledge-based society."
"I think that the initial version we have returned to of the document proposed by the European Commission will enable us to more smoothly implement a programme integrating all the initiatives that are now operational in the area of education."
"A unified system will ensure clarity and, most importantly, the possibility of avoiding redundancy in certain areas."
"Those states that are able to participate in lifelong learning programmes have experienced obvious benefits from this European Union initiative."
"For example, the Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci or Jean Monnet programmes are well known to the Lithuanian people, indicating that European Union initiatives in the area of education are being implemented quite effectively."
"I hope you will support my contention that the lifelong learning programme is of vital importance, both for promoting competition and entrepreneurship and in building a shared sense of European citizenship based on the values of the European Union, such as mutual understanding and respect for human rights and democracy."
"(PL) Mr President, I fully support the programme for lifelong learning in the Union."
"We are always saying that Europe has to become more competitive."
"Competitiveness must be built on the foundations of the knowledge triangle - education, research and innovation."
"Education is crucial to this structure."
"The Union's educational systems are the competence of the Member States, but a better-integrated European programme on education is very welcome."
"We now have the Seventh Research Framework Programme and a new Community programme on competitiveness and innovation was launched very recently."
"The angles of the Union's knowledge triangle are therefore well established."
"Questions arise as to the sides of the triangle: are these programmes adequately connected and do they support each other?"
"We must not think in terms of three separate programmes, three distinct key aims for the European Union, but in terms of a single joint aim, namely a knowledge society."
"I value the proposed changes to lifelong learning, such as the amendment of the Leonardo da Vinci programme to facilitate the transfer of innovation, and the amendment of the Grundtvig programme to facilitate the innovational mobility of older learners."
"All too often, however, the programme introduces innovative learning methods instead of opening up the field for the innovations themselves and for future researchers."
"There is no system for recruiting highly talented individuals, particularly participants in the Comenius and Erasmus programmes for young people, and allowing them to continue their development within the framework of the Marie Curie programme."
"The lifelong learning programme should also be in line with the research priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"All our actions should be aimed at ensuring the continuity of the knowledge triangle from school right up to the European Institute of Technology."
"I congratulate the Commissioner on this programme, and urge him to ensure that these comments are taken into account during its implementation."
"Member of the Commission."
"(SK) I am sure there is no need for me to add much; we should rather do more to implement what we have already agreed upon several times."
"Education is more than a period in one's life."
"We can deal with the issues of employment and growth through a much more coherent approach, which is what the Lisbon Strategy is all about."
"Education cannot be isolated from research and innovation (which involves creativity and the promotion of knowledge)."
"It is also necessary to deploy knowledge practically, and in innovative ways."
"I think that the Commission is heading in that direction."
"The proposal to set up the European Institute of Technology provided evidence of this at last week's summit in Lahti."
"There is further evidence of it in the whole programme and the policy of putting education at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy, and aiming to shape Europe and generate knowledge for growth and employment."
"The four pillars of the lifelong programme have very inspiring names - Comenius (Jan Amos Comenius), Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus of Rotterdam and Grundtvig."
"In my opinion this is an important signal."
"We will not be able to solve all financial problems through this programme, but we can provide a lot of inspiration, in particular for measures at national level so that education, which is within the competence of the Member States, becomes the focus of national approaches or of the Lisbon Strategy."
"There will then be much more money available, and we would certainly appreciate having more allocations for mobility and cooperation in the area of education."
"I think that the upcoming 20th anniversary of Erasmus, the most popular programme in the European Union, is a great opportunity to evaluate the situation, but also a challenge for us to do more together for education, young people and the future."
"With regard to visas and cooperation with other countries, as of 1 January 2007 Member States should implement or transpose the visa facilitation decision for students, lecturers and researchers throughout the European Union, with the exception of the UK, Ireland and Denmark."
"In response to whether we need harmonisation or some other kind of policy, I would say that what we need is complementarity and compatibility rather than the harmonisation of our education systems, and this is gradually being achieved through measures such as the Bologna Process."
"We are constantly calling not only for more investment but also for better investment."
"The first priority is for 'better investment' whereas 'more investment' comes second."
"'Better' also means raising public-private funds."
"This often takes the form of mobility or education sponsorship on the part of businesses and industry."
"So much for my reflections in response to some of the points that have been raised."
"May I once again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, the entire committee and all those who contributed for their high level of consensus and commitment."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur for her work in steering this important report through Parliament."
"Next year Erasmus celebrates its 20th anniversary, having been brought into being by one of my predecessors, Winnie Ewing, when she was chair of the Culture and Education Committee, and there is much to thank her for."
"Since 1987, over 1.2 million students have completed exchange courses at universities outside their own countries."
"In the 2004/2005 academic year, over 144 000 students took advantage of the opportunity provided by the Erasmus programme to continue their studies in a country other than their own."
"The benefit and invaluable cultural and linguistic experience this provides for students is second to none."
"As a former Erasmus exchange student myself, I can vouch for that."
"Erasmus has been one of the successes of the EU in demonstrating its relevance."
"But while the uptake for students coming to Scotland has been encouraging, with 2163 during 2004/2005, the number of Scottish students going abroad to study has been far less, standing at 1018."
"I want to see more Scots taking part in this programme and benefiting from the opportunity to study abroad."
"Erasmus is one way in which we can encourage our young people to have an international outlook."
"Annex - Commission statement"
"The Commission should like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ."
"This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with."
"For the 'Action programme in the field of lifelong learning', the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 6 970 million."
"""Europe for Citizens"" programme (2007-2013) (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (C6-0316/2006 for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the programme 'Europe for Citizens', to promote active European citizenship (09575/1/2006) (Rapporteur: Mr Takkula)."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank everyone who has been involved in the deliberations on this report, especially the shadow rapporteurs and members of other committees who have made their comments."
"I wish in particular to thank my esteemed colleagues and coordinators, Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets, because, being a member of the smallest group, I would not have been able to produce this report without your support."
"I am also grateful for the excellent team spirit and cooperation which you have shown in our committee."
"The programme consists of four areas of action."
"The first is a Europe of active citizens, which includes town-twinning and citizens' projects."
"Town-twinning has already proven to be a success story, and I hope that this success story will continue and go from strength to strength with this programme."
"Furthermore, the citizens' projects are very important."
"One central idea in establishing this programme was that the European Union could indeed have a grassroots programme which would not be elitist and which the people, the citizens of the European Union, could think of as theirs."
"The second area of action is active civil society in Europe."
"This could help provide structural support for EU public policy research organisations (think-tanks) and for NGOs at European level, as well as support for projects coordinated by these NGOs."
"I think it is vitally important that open adult education centres and vocational colleges, non-degree-based organisations, have a bigger role, because these are just the sort of organisations that are best at reaching out to ordinary people at grassroots level."
"This way, this programme will hopefully also open its doors to people all over the European Union, and they will feel it is something relevant to them."
"The third area of action is 'Together for Europe', supporting high visibility events, studies and information and dissemination tools."
"As we know, it is important to promote the European Union in the appropriate way and to bring it closer to people, because there are shortcomings too in the area of information and communications."
"People feel that they are a long way from the decision-making process, and therefore they feel that European Union programmes are remote."
"We have much work to do to bring the Union closer to the people by providing information and through various events."
"A fourth area of action was added to the programme, and this is the preservation of Active European Remembrance."
"There was intense discussion on this in our committee."
"We finally hit on the idea that, when this action was transferred from the Culture 2000 Programme, it was just this memory of Nazism and Stalinism that we needed to preserve, so that no horrors like this can ever occur again in Europe."
"We think that it is very important that future generations are also able to understand what the European identity is, what peace is, and what stability is, and it is therefore also important to guarantee active remembrance."
"It would also obviously have been desirable for the budget to be up-to-date when this programme was being put together."
"We know, however, that for some reason there is not as yet enough sympathy in the European Parliament, or at least not in the European Commission or the Council, for cultural projects, or enough appreciation of their importance."
"I myself believe that culture and our civil society create a basis on which a dynamic and thriving economy can also be built."
"We on the Committee on Culture and Education, being cultured people, should ensure that the budget will be more effective in the future."
"This time we were obliged to some extent to cut it from the Commission's original proposal under pressure from the Council, but I hope that the programme can be got underway here, and that it will become a success story."
"Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for the cooperation and general understanding that has been reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"I am especially glad that NGOs, open universities and amateur sports clubs have been included in the programme."
"I hope that when this programme starts in early 2007 it might become another success story."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, not more than half a year ago, I was here speaking on the same programme, asking for a quick agreement."
"At that time the proposal had a different title: 'Citizens for Europe'."
"Now, after half a year we are here, very close to the final decisions with the new title, 'Europe for Citizens', coming from your input; but I think this was a remarkable shift, both in consensus but also in the readiness top progress towards finalisation."
"This programme is very important for citizens and civic society organisations."
"I am very satisfied with the quality and intensity of negotiations between institutions that have taken place on the programme."
"I would like especially and sincerely to thank the Committee on Culture for its efforts to accelerate the procedure, and the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for his excellent work and cooperation."
"Those steps in the interinstitutional procedures were accompanied by informal trilateral meetings."
"They resulted in a compromise acceptable to all three institutions in the form of four amendments on which you will vote on tomorrow."
"Concerning the budget, we agreed to allocate an amount of EUR 190 million at 2004 prices, which means EUR 215 million at current prices."
"This is less than the Commission's original proposal but it still enables us to retain the structure of the programme, only reducing the number of outputs."
"I would like once more to express my regrets about the introduction by the Council of a supplementary step to the comitology procedure."
"This will slow down the selection procedure for certain categories of projects."
"However, with a view to reaching a quick agreement, the Commission accepted the position taken by the Council and supported by you."
"Today you are envisaging adopting four amendments: two of them concern the budget breakdown between different actions; one is technical and will accelerate the entry into force of the programme; and the last one adds the promotion of tolerance to the objectives of the programme."
"That is fully in line with the programme's philosophy."
"Let me repeat that the Commission fully supports the agreed compromise and therefore encourages Parliament to adopt those four amendments."
"If you adopt them, the Council has committed itself rapidly to adopt the whole agreed text and the programme should then be able to enter into force by 1 January 2007."
"I can assure you that once the programme is adopted the Commission will take all necessary steps to implement it as efficiently and as effectively as possible."
"Indeed, my services are already actively preparing its entry into force."
"We will work in close cooperation with the Programme Committee and in close dialogue with the organisations involved in this programme."
"I would like to finish by repeating what Mr Takkula said, i.e. that culture forms the basis for our societies, which is why we defined the legal base for this programme in combination with the culture-related Article 151 of the Treaty."
"It was the subject of many discussions, but I believe it is the right proposal and the right line to take, for future culture and citizenship to go hand in hand towards responsibility on all levels of our public and private engagement in our lives, as well as in the spheres of enlargement and the future of our Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for this very fine report on 'Europe for Citizens'."
"Now that the overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on, that is the amount with which, for lack of any understanding on the Council's part, we are obliged to manage."
"We support the rapporteur's two amendments, one of which aims for a 2% decrease, and the other at an increase by the same amount."
"We are particularly glad to see that the new Action 4, which has to do with memorials, keeps alive the memory not only of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also of those committed under Stalin."
"I would, however, Commissioner, like to address one other problem, one that has been raised by those who benefit from the programmes and by those who run them."
"This House wishes to point out that its resolution of 5 April 2006 referred to both conferences and seminars, and the bilateral seminars - working parties and meetings of experts - are essential components of the partnership effort in terms of qualifying the programmes and those who work on them, and grants should be available for them in the same way that they are for multilateral conferences."
"Furthermore, this House takes it as read that the Commission will, in the course of the applications procedure, accord equal treatment to local authorities and civil society organisations, and the object of that is that the Commission should be prevented from doing as had originally been planned and imposing additional requirements - such as guarantees and special bank sureties - on too many other social organisations, which they would find it difficult, indeed impossible, to meet."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, for his excellent report and for his good cooperation."
"I welcome this programme with open arms, for it will benefit the public, us in this House and the European Union as a whole."
"After all, the Europe for Citizens programme finally indicates that the citizens should not be there for Europe but the other way round."
"Europe is there for its citizens."
"Only when the European Union obtains concrete results for its citizens can we count on support for this European Union."
"Needless to say, we can try to enhance the bonding process between our citizens and the EU by organising exchange programmes and events, but it is always more successful if the citizens come up with their own initiatives, which is where this programme comes in."
"I am grateful to Mr Takkula, to my fellow Members in all the groups, as well as to the Commission and Council, for the good working relationship we have enjoyed in dealing with this dossier."
"There is, however, something that I need to get off my chest. The European Union has recognised that there is a chasm between its citizens and the institutions."
"This programme is in recognition of this and tries to make amends in this respect."
"Why then, have we skimped on this programme and other vitally important programmes?"
"Talking about citizen involvement without injecting money into it is, of course, a waste of time."
"I will in any event do all I can to promote this programme to people in the Netherlands."
"I hope that other Members will bring this programme to people's attention in their own countries too."
"If we all made a huge success of it, next time, the Council and the Commission may have no choice but to increase the budget of the Europe for Citizens programme to an acceptable level."
"There is no doubt that the Europe for Citizens programme can become a success."
"In Europe, there are many people who are prepared to actively work on Europe's integration."
"This programme allows them to take part in the process and get organising."
"It is, therefore, enormously important for the European citizens to have the sense of being involved in the EU's development."
"That is what this programme makes possible."
"My appeal to the citizens of Europe is therefore that they seize that opportunity."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work in producing this report on the promotion of active European citizenship."
"Many of us who genuinely care about the future of Europe believe that active citizenship will play an important role in the continuation of the European project."
"The EU is a work in progress; progress from centuries of division to a time of mutual cooperation."
"That mutual cooperation is for the benefit of all our citizens."
"Otherwise the EU has no raison d'être."
"It is also important to understand that this mutual cooperation is not just between Member States."
"That is certainly important, but it is not enough."
"There must also be mutual cooperation between our citizens so that they too are an integral part of the process - not as an audience, but as actors on the stage; not as observers but as participants."
"We are looking here at participative democracy alongside representative democracy - sometimes an uneasy alliance on both sides, but one we must promote because otherwise we just pay lip service to our citizens, and they deserve much better than that."
"I am pleased to see the inclusion of non-formal education programmes in this report."
"Perhaps we might extend that to the recognition of volunteering activities through the provision of a European volunteering passport."
"Volunteering plays an important role in active citizenship because many of the activities earmarked in the report, such as town twinning, civil society organisations and amateur sports organisations, involve volunteer participation."
"Intercultural dialogue must also be supported."
"All of us have our prejudices, our misconceptions about others, and it is only by engaging with each other that we begin to recognise each other's humanity; and that is the foundation of mutual cooperation and mutual respect."
"My only regret is that the funding provided will not be sufficient to accomplish the huge and important task we have set ourselves."
"However, I agree with the previous speaker: let us roll up our sleeves and get on with it."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Takkula."
"I am delighted that there has been a rethink in the naming of the programme, originally called 'Citizens for Europe', and that it is now called 'Europe for Citizens'."
"This means that the onus is on Europe, too, and that it must reach out to the public."
"The aim is to reach and involve citizens, to meet them locally, to take them seriously, to listen to their concerns and to win them over to Europe and the debate on its future."
"Town-twinning activities are a good means of contributing to this."
"A general discussion on European globalisation blues will also form part of the debates within this programme, however, as will the question as to how we can strike a balance between excessive neoliberalism on the one hand, and statism or excessive protectionism on the other."
"I should like to mention a further point, namely the inclusion of extermination camps - be they Stalinist or Nazi - in this programme."
"I believe that a further reappraisal of the history of this particular European totalitarianism, which destroyed Europe and brought great unhappiness to the whole world, is politically appropriate."
"Learning the appropriate lessons from this and building a genuinely open and democratic Europe remains one of our challenges for the future."
"The programme is also intended to make a contribution to this."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) We share the concerns and the objectives of the 'Europe for Citizens' programme and accordingly voted in favour."
"The truth of the matter is that this European Union is short of neither 'Europe for businesses' nor 'Europe for the market'."
"Far from it, in fact."
"We have had far too little 'Europe for citizens', too little support for a European citizenship with an active voice in the major themes on which we are building our shared territory."
"In this area, decisions lack courage, laws are thin on the ground and support is virtually non-existent."
"This programme alone will not in itself reverse this situation."
"We support the programme, but we are also critical of its budgetary weakness."
"A 60% cut on the original proposal is clearly excessive, but very much in keeping with the restrictive and outdated rule whereby all programmes in the field of education, culture and youth are underfunded."
"Chronic underfunding is not the result of any scarcity of resources, but of a deliberate policy strategy on the type of Union that the Member States want to construct, which resurfaced when the financial perspective for 2007-2013 was adopted, to the detriment of areas such as culture."
"There is no such thing as effective policy without adequate funding."
"Words and good intentions are all well and good, but the policy must be much more than this."
"Mr President, Mr Takkula, we agree with you as regards your preference for transparency in granting funding for projects."
"This should be based on clear criteria with open application procedures and impartial adjudicators. Unfortunately, this has not been the case."
"We are pleased to note that we will gradually see an end to the scandal of funding being granted outside the application system to organisations that place themselves above fair competition and are still receiving substantial long-term funding."
"This damages the Union's image."
"The fact that these organisations are often associated with important personalities who made their careers in the European institutions only makes matters worse."
"I come from a southern European country and I must say I warmly welcome the fresh air blowing in from the north in relation to this issue."
"Lastly, as regards the new line of funding on memorials to dictatorships, I should like once again to express our complete opposition to the criteria that have been followed."
"The exclusion of memorials to dictatorships that for decades oppressed various peoples in the south of Europe shows a lack of respect for the thousands of victims of these dictatorships."
"Without the victory over the fascist regimes of southern Europe, the borders of the EU would be quite different today, and its territory smaller."
"The exclusion of these dictatorships, and of the memory of them, sends out the wrong message to the citizens, suggesting, as it does, that there are some dictatorships whose memory should not be forgotten and others that are not so bad or even acceptable."
"It also sends out the wrong message to the world."
"A pragmatic attitude to dictatorships is indicative of double standards, and poisons and discredits the EU's external policy."
"A criterion based on unambiguously democratic principles would have been better than a mediocre, mean-spirited criterion that was unable to look beyond the scarcity of funding."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are all playing our part in the creation of the European Union, but we bring with us our own particular outlook, experience and observations."
"These make it clear that, although we have much in common, there is also much that divides us."
"Many European citizens are sceptical about the Union and dubious about European integration."
"As a result, whilst some are seeking ways of rapidly bringing about European integration, others feel that if this process has to take place at all, it must do so slowly and be carefully thought through."
"They feel it should be a long-term process that respects national traditions and takes account of contemporary experience."
"I welcome the fact that the Europe for Citizens Programme contains many of the suggestions made by Members of this House, in particular in the part concerning memorials to the victims of dictatorship."
"Financial support is available for places linked to the Nazi regime and also for memorials to the victims of Stalinist crimes."
"Much was said during the debate on the programme about how little the citizens identify with the process of European integration."
"A distinction was rightly drawn between citizens of the old, new and future Member States."
"Insufficient consideration was given, however, to the important fact that, while one group aims to create a single 'one size fits all' European model of national identity as quickly as possible, another inclines towards a Europe of nations, where the sense of national identity would be respected."
"The latter group would determine common cultural values on the basis of cultural diversity and dialogue."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft document on 'Europe for Citizens' is an example of detailed wishful thinking."
"Someone dreamt up the idea that if more money were invested in awareness raising, informing and including Europeans in Union events, the citizens would be brought closer to the Union and involved in European integration."
"A similar argument was adduced in the Soviet sphere of influence, where our lives were dominated by the single orthodox Socialist ideology."
"It was believed that pouring money into events would guarantee the development of so-called Socialist awareness."
"The Soviet system tried hard to create a single orthodox Soviet identity in the minds of Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and others."
"Nations were deprived of their right to their own distinctive identity."
"Someone has now decided that it will be easier to integrate Europeans if the relevant document is entitled 'Europe for Citizens' instead of 'Citizens for Europe'."
"We have seen all this before."
"Soviet citizens were not supposed to be for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was supposed to be for them."
"What was actually the case was that, for Lenin, Stalin and others, people thinking and acting as Russians, Poles or Hungarians were a hindrance."
"People brought up in Soviet multiculturalism were more malleable and more amenable to becoming slaves in the service of the empire."
"We would do well to remember that the genuine freedom of individuals and nations arises out of national cultures where it has its source."
"That is why this document should be consigned to the dustbin along with the legacy of the former Soviet Union."
"Mr President, our sense of citizenship, like our sense of identity, arises from our history, our culture, our language and our experience of life."
"It comes from the bottom up."
"This citizenship programme is top-down."
"It seeks to create a sense of citizenship where none exists."
"As such, it is doomed to fail and it is wholly improper."
"I was born a British citizen."
"I never asked to be a European citizen."
"I do not want European citizenship and I totally reject and repudiate it."
"The European Constitution, which incorporates the concept of EU citizenship, has been roundly rejected in France and Holland, and it would be rejected if it were voted on in the United Kingdom."
"The promotion of this failed concept is therefore highly contentious."
"We are using taxpayers' money to promote one side of a hotly disputed debate, and that is wrong, undemocratic and disgraceful."
"I call on colleagues to reject this report out of hand."
"Mr President, it is a very important achievement to have a common position adopted by the Council on this 'Europe for Citizens' programme and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Takkula, on his work and dedication and, in particular, for improving the scope of the programme."
"I want to dwell on two aspects of the programme: town twinning and the memorials to the victims of the twin dictatorships of Hitler and Stalin."
"I would urge Commissioner Figeľ to coordinate his work with that of his colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible for information and public relations, in order to maximise the impact of this extremely important report and programme."
"Firstly, on the town-twinning movement, I could not disagree more with the previous speaker."
"In my own country there are town-twinning associations which have existed for 50 years and others which have been newly founded."
"I wish that the Commissioners - because they are the only people who can do it - would give fair, free and open publicity to the dedication and voluntary work of these organisations."
"To hear in my own county town of Hertford, the German, French, British and European anthems sung by local citizens and by school children was infinitely more eloquent than the absurd anti-European propaganda that we are given to digest in much of our popular press."
"We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of public opinion and we cannot allow the sceptics simply to have the best tunes."
"We have got the best tune, but we have to proclaim it."
"Secondly, on the memorials, I am delighted that Mr Takkula has included the victims of Stalinist crimes, because half our European Union was subject to that dictatorship, and just imagine the disbelief of new citizens of the European Union that their suffering should be neglected, whereas those who suffered from Hitler's Third Reich should be commemorated."
"Therefore, I commend this report and this programme to Parliament and the entire European Union and let us hope that this time we win the argument."
"Mr President, Hungary has commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution."
"Old women and men remember the revolutionary events they witnessed, and young people try to image what happened 50 years ago when the anti-Stalinist revolution united the Hungarians, the reformed communists and the democrats."
"But some thousand extreme right-wing rioters changed everything last night."
"They attacked the police, burned down shops, some of them threw stones and bottles at a synagogue, shouting anti-Semitic slogans under the banner of the Hungarian Nazi movement."
"These tragic events show us how important it is to remember, and to allow us to remember, the tragedies and crimes of the 20th century."
"Mr Takkula's report rightly calls upon us to commemorate the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes."
"But it is not enough to commemorate: we have to combat present-day extremist ideologies as well."
"Stalinism is over, thank God; but the danger of the neo-Nazi extremists is still alive."
"Every democratic party has to condemn extreme right-wing ideologies and violence."
"We have to learn from the lesson of the Weimar Republic."
"The smallest concession to the extreme right could lead to huge tragedies."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Eurobarometer data are extremely worrying."
"Most EU citizens are unfamiliar with the Union's institutional system."
"The Commission's role is seen as either vague or very vague."
"The Council is virtually unknown as an institution."
"The citizens' perceptions are extremely muddled."
"Many citizens are incapable of expressing a considered opinion on Europe."
"There is one salient fact running through these data: the citizens want more information and have chosen television as the best means to receive that information."
"We have seen that theoretical or bland citizenship, some vague feeling of belonging, makes Europe weaker."
"Europe is viewed more as an abstraction than an important presence in our lives."
"What we need is not theoretical or bland citizenship, but strong, practical citizenship, a feeling of loyalty, a feeling that Europeans can identify with a Community whose destiny is encapsulated in its universal values."
"Without this feeling of loyalty and identification, no political project can succeed."
"Citizenship is the biggest challenge facing a post-national society such as Europe."
"European citizenship is a product of reason, not of tradition."
"It needs to be constructed; it is not born spontaneously."
"This is a new political era, one characterised by sharing and by new forms of governance."
"It is indeed a time in which the sovereignty of States has shifted to a sovereignty of people."
"Be that as it may, how ironic is it that the policy does not encourage people to identify with a project that places them at the centre?"
"The Citizens for Europe Programme does not provide an adequate budget or an incisive enough information strategy."
"Publicity about the institutions - especially on television - showing the institutions and the European project must not be delayed any further."
"Explaining Europe is vital in forming a feeling for Europe."
"- (SL) The greatest achievement of the European Union to date has been guaranteeing peace and coexistence amongst the nations of Europe."
"However, critics of the European Union frequently complain that the work carried out by European institutions is too expensive and too remote from its citizens."
"The 'Europe for Citizens' programme offers new initiatives that will help to bring European citizens closer together, including those who are not enrolled in any type of formal education but who wish to gain new knowledge and experience and forge contacts with other citizens of the European Union."
"Participation in this programme is open to twin towns, so the programme will also be accessible to the kind of people who do not take part in major European Union projects every day."
"However, indirect contact and personal experience can contribute appreciably to an understanding of the Union, as I have noticed when I have met groups from Slovenia who are visiting the European Parliament."
"Sport, too, has a great power to unify and can communicate across linguistic boundaries."
"Participation in top-level sport is fast becoming the preserve of an increasingly narrow circle of people."
"This programme supports international participation by the wider masses."
"Major projects bring major benefits, but smaller projects bring great pleasure to many individuals."
"The programmes will be all the more successful if citizens can access them easily and if they do not have to fill in mountains of forms every time they make an application."
"Our citizens often become disenchanted with the European Union precisely because they encounter too many administrative obstacles when attempting to secure funding."
"This is why we must endeavour, when offering worthwhile programmes, to streamline procedures and to ensure greater awareness of such funds and easier access to them, at both European and national level."
"Member of the Commission."
"(SK) I would like to thank you for all your contributions and particularly for the commitment you have shown concerning the importance of working together as fellow citizens of the EU when dealing with certain issues or ideas."
"The programme itself constitutes the legal basis for implementation and will define the conditions that the Commission too will be required to meet."
"It is important that these conditions be known and implemented as soon as possible."
"Parliament will be involved through the Steering Committee and programme evaluation."
"As regards voluntary work and improvements in the recognition of informal education, we are interested in, and are striving for, progress in these areas, particularly from the perspective of young people."
"This will be done through the Youth Pass, which should add greater transparency and value to voluntary work."
"I agree that it is necessary to raise awareness of the results achieved so far, and of the successes and the nature of this cooperation, particularly, for example, in the area of cooperation between towns and cities."
"More than 10 000 municipalities in the EU are cooperating under the civic programme."
"Three weeks ago we awarded 11 golden stars for the best projects - those which are inspiring and which help real people solve real problems in towns and cities across the EU."
"Such projects might be more widely copied if people were made more aware of them."
"In this respect, I agree with Mr Beazley."
"The programme will also provide opportunities for special events."
"I would like to refer, for example, to last year's celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the Polish Solidarity Movement that were funded from a special budget line and heading."
"It will be possible to implement this approach over the next seven years using the Citizenship Programme."
"In conclusion, as well as a 'business-friendly' or 'market-friendly' Europe, we also have a real need for a 'citizen-friendly' Europe that is both well-disposed and helpful to its citizens, having as its foundations civil society and a certain degree of maturity."
"I would also like to emphasise that the name of the programme is but one side of the coin, as the relationship between 'citizens for Europe' and 'Europe for Citizens ' is a very important one."
"This is our space and at the same time it serves us."
"We need to shape and develop this space and to take responsibility for it."
"Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the entire Parliament for a very constructive approach to the programme."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Written statement (Rule 142)"
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Please allow me to offer my congratulations on the creation of the 'Europe for Citizens' Programme (2007-2013) and to congratulate Mr Takkula on the most recent version of the report."
"Europe's institutional, social and political relationships today form a dense network, the threads of which have become even more closely interwoven since enlargement."
"Forming active European citizens plays a key role in this process, and the presence of such citizens is indispensable in order to ensure the continued democratic and balanced development of the European Union."
"If we are to have European citizens who take responsibility for themselves and their society, we need to emphasise what today are considered to be 'lost' values, such as freedom, fairness, tolerance and solidarity, which constitute the fundamental values and cohesive bond of European society."
"I also consider the balanced integration of citizens to be important, but above all, I believe that we need to foster dialogue between different cultures and worldviews."
"Only in this way can we work together toward a common goal, shaping our own visions while accepting the differences of others and respecting our diversity."
"Only mutual understanding, solidarity and a sense of belonging can give the citizens of Europe a sense of identity."
"I support the efforts to shape a European citizenry based on common values, history and culture."
"It is important to promote and celebrate the values and achievements of today's citizens, while not allowing our memories of the past to sink into oblivion."
"If we keep our common cultural heritage at the forefront, we will strengthen the foundations of our shared future."
"In my view, European citizenship means nothing other than taking responsibility for ourselves, our country and the European Union, and freely exercising our rights while respecting the same rights of others."
"The right balance must also be struck between democratic rights and obligations."
"This is a common European citizenship of which I would be pleased to be part."
"Annex - Commission statement"
"The Commission should like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ."
"This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with."
"For the programme in question, the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 215 million."
"Restrictions on the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Schlyter, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council C6-0418/2005 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (amendment to Council Directive 76/769/EEC)."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work on this proposal, which has made it possible to reach agreement with the Council at first reading."
"This is an important directive."
"It is concerned with restricting the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) and related substances."
"These substances are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic."
"They have the potential to cause unacceptable risks to human health and the state of the environment."
"The proposed Directive is based on specific risk assessments and impact assessments of possible measures."
"It takes into account detailed discussions with all interested parties."
"The Directive prohibits in principle, with very limited derogation, the marketing and use of PFOS and related substances."
"Derogations are envisaged for essential applications in small quantities, which do not pose any unacceptable risks according to the opinion of the Commission's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks."
"Large-scale uses - for example in the field of textiles and carpets - have already been discontinued by industry, and this Directive will reliably prevent the reintroduction of such uses."
"The proposed Directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment, but also serve to strengthen the internal market, as it introduces Community-wide harmonised rules for the marketing and use of PFOS and related substances."
"With regard to the derogations contained in the proposal, I agree that the use of PFOS and related substances should continue to be permitted in photoresists and photographic materials, when plating with hexavalent chromium and other metals, and in hydraulic fluids, as the risks connected with these uses are acceptable since there are no equivalent alternatives and it is not certain that the toxicological profiles of the alternatives are any better."
"With regard to fire-fighting foams, I can agree that the marketing and use of new foams should be prohibited and that a period of 54 months should be granted for the continued use of existing stocks."
"On the other hand, I am not prepared, at present, to support the extension of the envisaged restrictions to other perfluorinated alkyl compounds such as PFOA, as this would be premature given the absence of a completed risk assessment and of sufficient knowledge of current uses and alternatives, but we can return to this subject."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the transformation process has benefited greatly from the close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The Commission can therefore endorse all the compromise amendments proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for their very sound and constructive cooperation."
"It made it possible to find a solution at first reading together with the Council, which also did some good work on this issue."
"This solution improves on the Commission's original proposal, and I am pleased to see that the Commission too is now backing the compromise."
"PFOS and PFOS-related substances are highly fluorinated and extremely difficult to break down."
"They are additionally very bioaccumulative."
"We have become aware that chloro-organic compounds are poisonous and cause problems in the environment and we have observed that bromo-organic compounds are hazardous."
"Fire retardants pose a bigger threat than the fires they were designed to prevent."
"It is now the turn of fluoro-organic compounds."
"They are extremely stable, and the bond between the fluorine and carbon is the strongest in organic chemistry."
"The properties of stability and surface activity are what have made PFOS a much sought-after chemical."
"It has, as the Commissioner says, been used for many years in surface treatment for chemicals and textiles."
"The largest manufacturer realised the risks posed to its workers and to the consumers of its products."
"Its workers had high levels of the chemical in their bodies, and it decided to withdraw the PFOS product Scotchguard from the market."
"The Commission's aim with this proposal was to prevent the re-introduction of PFOS, but the compromise goes further."
"We now have tougher concentration regulations and we are setting the limit for preparations at 0.005%."
"This is reasonable, given that its very properties as a surfactant mean that PFOS is used in low concentrations."
"If the limit were set at 0.1%, there would be a risk of more applications slipping through the legislative net."
"The definition of surfaces at 1 microgram per square metre shares the same purpose."
"Under the compromise with the Council, PFOS is also prohibited in fire-fighting foams."
"This is entirely logical."
"There are already alternatives on the market that do not contain fluoro-organic compounds."
"It is also appropriate to phase out stocks, and, in the compromise, Parliament has extended this phasing-out period to 54 months."
"Everyone has a vested interest in hastening the phase-out."
"The large oil fire in the UK that resulted in millions of litres of water being contaminated with PFOS showed the costs of using PFOS."
"The only way to destroy PFOS is by high-temperature combustion."
"Everyone can see for themselves how much work is involved in burning millions of litres of water at high temperature."
"Chromium plating is the other big area."
"In this field, the proposal restricts the use of non-decorative hard chromium-plating using hexavalent chromium as the process implement."
"This exception, moreover, is to be reviewed after an inventory of existing essential uses, which is to be carried out by the Member States within two years."
"In this area too there are alternatives, such as bigger, enclosed systems, better ventilation and in the future, I hope, also other processes."
"As far as other exceptions such as photolithography processes and anti-reflective coating and industrial treatments for photographic film are concerned, the quantities in question are very small."
"Even so, these exceptions too will cease to apply once alternatives are technically and financially feasible."
"I would also like to speak about PFOA, which refers to the acids and salts of the same group of substances."
"In Germany, many people in the Ruhr area know what it is like to have contaminated water. People now have to take their drinking water from tanker vehicles, which is a costly and unsustainable solution."
"We can attempt to stop these contaminants by means of the codicil that has been added to the compromise on PFOA, according to which the Commission is to analyse and continuously take stock of progress on alternatives."
"Once there are reliable alternatives, these will replace PFOA."
"I believe that we are ahead of our time here."
"We must get to grips with this matter because the next great environmental issue may be fluoro-organic chemistry and the various forms thereof."
"This is a first step towards protecting people and the environment from a number of these substances."
"I would also point out that this is a first reading agreement and that if Parliament were now to support this compromise, that would also mean that the Council would support it and that we should be ready before REACH enters into force."
"This agreement would then form an annex to REACH."
"If we were unable to succeed with this agreement tomorrow, the proposal would simply fall, as REACH would then take over."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I hope that we are on the way to a first reading agreement."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his excellent cooperative work on this report."
"I was delighted to hear that the Commission agrees with all our rapporteur's compromise amendments."
"It augurs well, indeed, for a first reading agreement."
"Perfluorooctane sulfonates - PFOS - are chlorinated compounds with numerous applications in consumer products such as textiles and paper, are known for their repellent properties, amongst others, and are used daily in many consumer products."
"They also have some specific industrial applications in products as wide-ranging as microchips, fire-fighting foams, chromium plating and hydraulic fluids used in aviation."
"These chemical substances are known to be very toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative."
"We have achieved several important changes to the draft proposal, which will bring greater protection for human health and the environment, especially in the area where the maximum threshold for the amount of PFOS that can be placed on the market as a substance or preparation has been substantially reduced from the Commission's original proposal."
"I welcome the inclusion of PFOA - perfluorooctanic acid - in the scope of this directive."
"According to a recent OECD survey, the substance has a similar structure and toxicity to PFOS and thus should be phased out accordingly."
"Industry has voluntarily proposed to limit the use of PFOA by 2014, which in itself is a clear sign that our instincts were right to insist on its inclusion in the legislation."
"The changes introduced by this House have improved the proposal, and Mr Schlyter's report is both balanced and objective."
"The report recognises that limited specific use derogations are needed for critical applications of substances for which no alternative currently exists, for example PFOS is essential in very small quantities in the semi-conductor sector and in hydraulic fluids used in aviation."
"The fact that the phasing-out of these will be based on a case-by-case review, taking into account new information on details of uses and on safer alternatives, is a constructive and realistic way to encourage the affected industries to actively seek alternatives."
"In conclusion, it appears that this piece of legislation will go through under the Finnish Presidency and we can avoid tying these toxic chemicals up in the REACH queue."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) I welcome the compromise package drawn up by the Council and the European Parliament, which in many respects tightens the Commission's proposal."
"It is good to see that Parliament is so united on the question of banning or limiting a dangerous substance."
"Health, the protection of the environment and the desire for a healthy life are more important than the narrow interests of industry."
"There is no longer any doubt as to the problem posed by chemical substances."
"Stricter regulation is necessary in the area of chemicals, and this is indeed the focus of REACH, which seeks to regulate not merely one particular substance but some 30 000 compounds."
"As regards today's proposal, it has been scientifically proven that perfluorooctane sulfonate is a hazardous substance."
"It endangers human health and is a persistent substance, one that does not biodegrade and is bio-accumulative, that is, it builds up in the body's cells."
"Its use must therefore be restricted."
"I consider it an achievement that the substance is being banned in more areas than in the original proposal, and in other areas it can remain in use only during a period of transition."
"In the case of dangerous fires, fire-fighting foam may continue to be used for some time."
"If it is a question of saving human lives, then naturally we must use whatever is at hand."
"Over the longer term, however, it is vital that the chemical be replaced by substances that are not harmful to the human body."
"I consider it particularly forward-looking that the substitution principle has been built into this directive, which means - as everyone is no doubt aware - that the toxic chemical must be replaced by a different, harmless substance, and that research on and the introduction of such a substance is the responsibility of the manufacturer."
"Over the longer term, therefore, the use of PFOS will only be permitted where its replacement is impossible, and where it does not come into direct contact with the human body."
"I hope that those who will now vote for the substitution principle in this directive will also vote for the substitution principle for other compounds as contained in the REACH directive."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his constructive cooperation."
"It is well known that the two of us do not always see eye to eye, but I welcome the fact that a vote is to be held tomorrow on a compromise that will enable agreement at first reading."
"I also welcome the fact that the compromise disregards a number of the demands made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety such as the precipitate inclusion of PFOA without a prior risk assessment."
"The toxicity of PFOS is undisputed, including by industry."
"After all, industry took it upon itself to dispense with the use of PFOS in particularly critical applications such as consumer goods."
"Some sectors at the top end of the value-added chain, such as the aviation, aerospace and semiconductor industries, cannot dispense with the use of PFOS at present, however."
"A ban on PFOS or a derogation involving strict time limits would deprive some high-technology sectors of planning security."
"The Commission proposal already lays down appropriate derogations for this, and it is essential that these be retained until there is a suitable substitute."
"The problem with PFOS is not the use of the substance in these sectors, however, but the fact that it is still found in old textiles such as carpets and clothing and reaches the environment via these."
"I should like to make some concluding remarks on EU chemicals policy with regard to the forthcoming REACH debate."
"EU chemicals legislation must strike a balance between the socio-economically appropriate use of certain substances and high environmental standards."
"As with PFOS, derogations must always be possible where there are no suitable alternatives."
"After all, the objective of chemicals policy must be the safe, risk-based handling of chemicals rather than the ideological policy of complete chemical bans."
"I hope that the Commissioner will remain committed to a sound chemicals policy in future, too."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to decide on the restriction of the hazardous and harmful substances perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and the closely-related perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA)."
"I am especially pleased that there is such broad support for the sterling work done by my compatriot Mr Schlyter."
"Good work, Carl!"
"I think that we need to remember this shared vision when, later this autumn, we take another extremely important decision - both for the environment and for our health - namely that relating to the chemicals legislation known as REACH."
"I hope that on that occasion we will again see great support across the political spectrum from left to right and from the Commission to the Council of Ministers."
"As already mentioned, PFOS is a hazardous substance."
"It is bioaccumulative, which means that it stays in the environment and our bodies for a long time."
"A study of people from 17 countries by the World Wide Fund for Nature found that PFOS and six other perfluorinated compounds were present in people's bodies."
"It is thus high time that there was a restriction."
"I am therefore pleased to see that Mr Schlyter and an in principle unanimous Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have tightened up the threshold value for how much PFOS may be in use in the market."
"I would also have liked to see the committee adding in clearer specifications of dates for when PFOS is to be phased out from the market."
"Apart from this reservation, this is, in my opinion, an excellent report that I and my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, look forward to voting in favour of."
"I would like to finish where I began."
"For Parliament to place restrictions on substances that are hazardous to health and to the environment is a good thing."
"It is also absolutely wonderful that there is such broad support for these measures."
"I hope, therefore, that we can keep this in mind when we decide on REACH later this autumn."
"Let us also, on that occasion, see broad support for powerful legislation on chemicals."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to echo the previous speakers' thanks to the rapporteur."
"Ladies and gentlemen, imagine you are the mother or father of a young child, and your district health authority tells you the drinking water that you yourself have been drinking for months, even years, is no longer to be used for preparing baby foods or for your children on account of very high concentrations of PFOS."
"Imagine you are the mayor of a medium-sized town and have to spend several million euro in public funds - taxpayers' and fee payers' money - on removing the PFOS from drinking-water supplies."
"Then you would certainly have a major problem."
"This is what happened a few weeks ago in my electoral region, South Westphalia."
"We have major problems with PFOS, and the cause does not lie at local level. Instead, we have found that the trail of this massive contamination leads to other Member States - probably Belgium and the Netherlands."
"There is a high likelihood, therefore, of problems of the kind currently faced by parents and local-government officials in my region occurring in many other regions of Europe, too, when one looks more closely."
"For this reason, we must now ascertain the exact cause in this specific case and, in the event that declarations have been altered illegally, we must investigate this."
"We must also tackle the root of the problem, however, as the concentration is particularly high in this case."
"This substance has even been found in Antarctica and at the source of the Rhine, where there is no industry whatsoever."
"We have to look at this very carefully."
"That is why I am pleased that we have managed to elaborate and improve the Commission proposal, and that we have deleted a number of unjustified derogations - such as the one for fire-fighting foams, for which there are alternatives."
"We have now reached a good compromise, and should support it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schlyter rightly deserves our congratulations for his excellent report, which I fully support."
"Arguably the most important aspect of this legislative proposal is that the story of PFOS is unfortunately one of shame for EU and international consumer protection, and one that should never be allowed to be repeated."
"Although PFOS were well known to be persistent bioaccumulative toxic compounds, they were extensively used in numerous consumer products and in various industrial applications for decades."
"This has resulted in the irreversible contamination of the environment and of both animals and humans."
"Let us all hope that the directive under consideration here will be fully implemented as soon as possible, but let us at the same time remember that appropriate legislation will also be needed to deal with the hundreds of other perfluorinated compounds which are also very toxic and which today are more or less freely allowed to poison us and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to Mr Schlyter for his report, which shows great commitment."
"PFOS, a halogenated hydrocarbon, is toxic to humans, and also both carcinogenic and mutagenic."
"There are no scientific limit values for this category of substances, only empirical threshold values."
"These substances are not biodegradable, they are fat soluble and, once produced, they persist almost indefinitely."
"In addition, once they have been absorbed by the human body, it is virtually impossible for it to eliminate them."
"It is highly likely that PFOA has a very similar or identical effect in medical and toxicological terms, even though the body of scientific data on this does not yet have any conclusive evidential value."
"REACH will probably apply to this, and the substitution principle will play a decisive role, although, personally, I always have reservations about this."
"For all my enthusiasm for the economy and for value added, as a Christian I do not want to balance value added against human life."
"I am alarmed by the values of these chemicals measured in both marine and freshwater fish."
"Now - rightly and with a clear conscience - we are going further than the original proposal of the Commission and the Council."
"The threshold value has been lowered massively by almost two powers of ten."
"The number of derogations for chromium plating has been reduced significantly."
"Logically, the derogation for fire-fighting foams has been deleted, as unlimited quantities of these can be released into the environment."
"The derogation for closed systems has been deleted, as it is scarcely possible to prove that these are sealed."
"On the whole, I should like to express my thanks for the constructive cooperation I have enjoyed, and above all for the speed at which this issue has been dealt with, since we were able to reach a workable compromise in less than three months."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to discuss the issue of PFOA briefly, and then go on to make a very fundamental point."
"The final decision has not yet been taken in the matter of PFOA."
"It was not possible to include a ban on these substances in the Directive, as we are not in possession of a satisfactory risk assessment or an impact assessment."
"An international risk assessment is being carried out at present at OECD level, however."
"Naturally, we shall look at the results carefully and make any necessary proposals."
"I live in the same German Land as the honourable Member Mr Liese and have been following the case he described myself with great interest."
"All I can say today is that, although the investigations by the German authorities have not been concluded, I have the very strong impression that this is a case of environmental crime, plain and simple."
"Contrary to the law in force, toxic substances have been introduced into the environment."
"Whether these Directives could have prevented this is a different story."
"Nevertheless, I think it important that Mr Liese referred to this case, as it confirms explicitly once more the kind of risks he described."
"In a modern industrial society, it is inevitable that we have to live with certain risks."
"The question as to which risks we consider acceptable and which we do not is one on which we have to keep deciding anew."
"There is a series of assessment benchmarks that can help us make this decision."
"I should like to mention one risk that I do not accept - and here I am speaking as the Commissioner for Industry."
"I do not accept the argument that we must accept the risk of highly toxic substances in our environment because investments have been made."
"I do not accept the argument that we must accept such substances because they lead to revenue generation."
"I do not even accept the argument - even if this does not make me any friends - that we must use these substances so that jobs are not lost."
"I consider wholly inappropriate this comparison between jobs in industry and the use of toxic substances for which alternatives exist."
"In situations such as this, the decision can only be to protect human beings and the environment unconditionally from avoidable risks."
"This is the line that underlies my policy, at least, on all these issues."
"The House will notice this when we come to discuss the most important, extensive and modern chemicals legislation in the world - namely REACH - shortly in plenary."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Third-country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the annual report from the Commission to the European Parliament on third country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action against the Community (2004)."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 2004 annual report on third-country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action, presented by the Commission services, has uncovered a piece of information that has raised a number of concerns within our parliamentary committee."
"It appears from the report that there has been an abnormal increase in the number of trade protection cases, involving both traditional users of these measures and more recently developed WTO member states."
"In many cases, WTO rules and case-law have been partially or completely disregarded, causing damage to Community industry."
"For the developed countries, led by the United States, major problems arise as a result of the unilateral and half-hearted application of WTO rules."
"For some emerging countries, the application of countervailing duties is not intended to counteract illegal practices, but to give their local industries extra protection against European imports."
"In many cases, the investigating standards are low and raise a number of questions as to their full compliance with WTO rules."
"The Commission report relates some of those significant cases, namely the 'Zeroing' case with the United States, the Indian anti-dumping cases, the South American and Austrian farming cases and, in general, the extensive and unfair use of safeguards."
"In many of the cases brought against the European Community, the Community has succeeded in obtaining a satisfactory settlement for resolving the disputes within the WTO."
"Nevertheless, a success such as that often comes too late, and irreparable damage is done to European industry."
"Faced with the picture presented to us by the Commission in its report, the Committee on International Trade could have acted on instinct and suggested adopting the same methods and behaviour as those trade partners that violate the anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard rules, but it has not done so."
"We are in fact convinced that respect for the trade rules established at international level and within a multilateral framework is the mainstay of economic growth and, more generally, of the peaceful relationship between nations."
"Two wrongs never make a right."
"Having established that, we should like to reaffirm that the rules must be applied and that, if they are not applied, corresponding sanctions must be swiftly imposed in order to guarantee that the law is upheld."
"If they are not swiftly applied, the damage will be irreparable."
"In defence of the law and of that sector of European industry that feels unfairly affected by unlawful measures, we call on the Commission to take a firm stand in pursuing the WTO negotiations, which are aimed at making other WTO members apply trade protection measures in a less arbitrary way, and to act as the promoter of actions aimed at having the decisions of the WTO dispute settlement body applied more swiftly and effectively."
"These points should be included in the Doha Development Agenda if - as we hope - these negotiations are resumed."
"We therefore call on the Commission to accord due importance to this matter as part of the initiatives aimed at increasing the external competitiveness of European industry, such as were recently announced by Mr Mandelson before the Committee on International Trade."
"Finally, we recommend that the Commission refrain from giving preferential or special treatment to those trade partners that repeatedly fail to comply with WTO rules and case-law, giving rise to serious economic consequences for European industry."
"The Committee on International Trade is of the opinion that, when faced with serious situations, we cannot remain completely passive."
"If we want to gain the citizens' support for the new international trade rules, we need to strive for greater transparency, consistency and respect for the law on the part of all the actors, by implementing measures ranging from border controls to the application of common sanctions against those who trade in counterfeit or illegal goods on European soil."
"We can associate the conclusions of this report with the recent Commission initiative in favour of a reform of the European Community's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy policy."
"The aim of this reform is to restrict the use of these instruments by the Commission as part of the efforts to ensure that the Community interest is looked at more carefully and more extensively."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and the Committee on International Trade for the excellent work that they have done on this important issue."
"The European Union is a major exporter worldwide and this leaves us exposed to trade defence actions by third countries."
"When such actions are taken in compliance with WTO rules, we cannot and should not complain, and we do not."
"However, that is not always the case and these actions can easily become a serious and unjustified impediment to our legitimate market access opportunities."
"Therefore, we must closely monitor third-country actions against our exports and intervene to minimise the negative impact of such actions on our companies."
"And we should certainly be vigilant."
"Whenever possible we favour the diplomatic route, which is the quicker and the most efficient way to solve those issues when we have partners who wish to solve them."
"But when diplomacy fails, we do not hesitate to resort to WTO panels, as it is our right to do."
"Both the diplomatic and the litigation approaches have met with notable successes."
"Take, for example, the Indian cases mentioned in the report."
"Diplomacy has resulted in the removal of no fewer than 12 measures."
"We also hope for significant success on the agricultural products cases that you have identified."
"It is well known that the United States is a recurrent problem for us in this context."
"It is pro-free trade, but its use of the trade defence instrument is seen by many as unreasonable on certain issues. This has been particularly marked in the steel sector, where we have been arguing against certain practices for years on a large number of their dumping and subsidy measures."
"We have had a considerable success in Geneva but, frankly, it is a long hard slog even getting them to implement the remedies to the disputes which they have lost."
"We cannot solve everything through diplomacy or litigation."
"This is why we welcome your support for the proposals we have tabled in the Doha Round to strengthen the rules and the disciplines governing the use of anti-dumping and countervailing measures."
"The Round is suspended, something I deeply deplore and regret, but we are fighting hard to get it restarted."
"For trade defence this would allow us to seek improved disciplines along the lines of the EU practice in this field, making it more difficult for countries to abuse the system, which I am afraid some are only too prepared to do."
"We need tightened disciplines in the anti-dumping system."
"We need greater transparency in the operation of trade defence instruments."
"We need less arbitrariness on the part of governments."
"Such behaviour simply discredits the rules."
"It brings the system into disrepute and it does not reflect credit on the multilateral trade system and its principal institution, the WTO."
"We agree with you that the dispute settlement mechanism is an essential feature of the WTO system, which needs protecting, but we are working hard to improve it so that faster remedies can be achieved."
"We will take the opportunity of any bilateral trade agreement with third countries to ensure that our partner countries take on specific obligations on the fair use of trade defence instruments."
"This is not an alternative to strengthening and improving the rules at the WTO. On the contrary, it underpins that."
"It is a way of getting insurance in place, so that we can use all available methods to bring reason and discipline to the operation of these instruments."
"This would particularly apply for those countries that abuse them the most."
"Good practices are as important as good rules."
"That is why the Commission's departments devote a great deal of time and resources to providing technical assistance to third countries that become new users of trade defence instruments."
"Our aim is that they should apply them in a fair and balanced manner and in accordance with our own high standards."
"These efforts seem to bear fruit."
"The end of 2005 saw a welcome change from the trend of previous years, with a significant fall in the number of trade defence cases initiated against Community exporters, from 33 in 2004 to 19 in 2005."
"Market access, including a fair and proper implementation of WTO trade defence instruments by our trading partners, features high on our priority list and we will continue to take any steps required to ensure that our exports are not unduly penalised."
"Of course it is difficult to follow each and every case with our current resources and I would certainly like to do more for our exporters, in particular small and medium-sized companies, which often have little experience in this area."
"The EU must remain an example that others can follow."
"As the report recalls, we are viewed as a moderate user of trade defence instruments."
"That reputation is deserved and that must remain so."
"It is in that spirit that I recently launched a reflection process on how Europe's trade defence instruments such as the anti-dumping instrument operate in the modern global economy."
"A broad public consultation will take place early in 2007, based on a Green Paper expected in the coming months."
"This consultation will allow the Commission to draw on a wide range of views and identify whether there is scope to improve our rules and practices further."
"Our trade defence instruments can make an important contribution to ensuring both free and fair trade, thereby stimulating our competitiveness."
"This will involve strong and close cooperation with all stakeholders, including Member States and industry, and, I would add, the support and involvement of the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the general tone of both the Commission's and Mrs Muscardini's reports in wanting to see a world trading system that is as open and fair as possible."
"However, when we consider the anti-dumping measures of third countries, we in the Community need to show moral leadership and avoid hypocrisy."
"We can agree that trade defence mechanisms are often used as an excuse to protect domestic markets from competition; but we should also admit that the EU is sometimes guilty of using these mechanisms to protect uncompetitive companies from non-EU providers - shoes and textiles being recent examples."
"Fortunately, we continue to be sparing users of these mechanisms."
"With the potential collapse of the Doha development round, we must work with our trading partners to ensure that their legislation and practices comply as far as possible with WTO rules."
"However, to have any moral authority in this area, our own anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations must be transparent and impartial."
"I am concerned about the call for a Community approach to defend exporting SMEs faced with protectionism abroad."
"During last year's 'bra wars', it was a so-called Community approach that suspended imports from China and caused SMEs in London's fashion industry to lose contracts and to provide compensation to clients left waiting for unfulfilled orders."
"If that is a Community approach, then we in London want to see less of it."
"When it comes to arbitration, I think we all agree that any ad hoc arbitration group should consist of relevant experts."
"But we must ensure that any experts serving on these groups are experts in the sector being investigated who understand the structure of the industry and costs involved, not simply experts in more general trade issues."
"Overall, I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the rapporteur on this report."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, the increase in international trade in recent years has led, among other things, to increased competition and has tempted many countries to resort to trade protection mechanisms in order to protect their markets."
"It should not, therefore, come as a surprise that there have been increasing numbers of situations in which anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures have been adopted."
"European exports, as the report before us clearly demonstrates, have been the target on a number of occasions of such measures on the part of third countries."
"Such cases have risen alarmingly."
"As well as the traditional countries, some of the new players to have arrived on the international trade relations scene are involved."
"This phenomenon, which could significantly harm a number of European industries, must therefore be tackled seriously."
"Such an approach entails, first and foremost, carefully separating cases in which the use of these instruments arises entirely from the legitimate implementation of the principles of fair trade relations from those in which their use is merely a legal smokescreen to cover up illegal protectionist measures in the very worst sense of the term."
"This distinction can only be made completely clearly if we are committed to strengthening transparency in the processes aimed at assessing whether trade defence measures are being used legitimately or otherwise. The aim is therefore to ensure complete compliance with the rules and the case law of the World Trade Organisation."
"To this end, the Commission must channel its efforts into helping improve these procedures, thereby discouraging the illicit use of these instruments."
"That being said, it is appropriate to mention the importance of the Commission's assistance to the Member States and to European industry in trade protection cases initiated by third countries."
"This support is particularly significant for SMEs, which by nature are less well equipped to deal with situations of this kind."
"Lastly, we welcome the fact that the Commission is ready to take an active role within the WTO in jointly reviewing the provisions regulating the adoption of trade protection instruments, with a view to stressing the value of multilateralism."
"At no point in this debate, however, must it be forgotten that the EU is the most open trading area in the world and that the Europeans also have legitimate interests to safeguard."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Muscardini on this successful report."
"Freedom of access to foreign markets is vital to large numbers of European enterprises."
"This freedom of access does not exist in many cases today, with third countries hindering European enterprises' market access in downright breach of agreements or in contravention of the WTO rules."
"In so doing, these third countries exploit the whole spectrum of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade skilfully to their advantage and our disadvantage."
"The competitiveness of the European economy, and thus of the EU labour market, suffers tremendously as a result of these problems."
"These actions on the part of some of our trade partners are unacceptable."
"Commissioner, the EU cannot allow other countries to treat us like this."
"All participants in world trade must abide by the rules."
"It also applies that the EU should not treat third countries like this."
"We, too, must abide by all the rules in order to take credible action against rule-breakers without any open flanks."
"Fair, free world trade is possible only if rules are in place that are binding and are observed by all parties without exception."
"What is to be done, therefore?"
"I would call on the Commission to do everything possible to ensure that we Europeans abide by the rules."
"I call on the Commission to take measures to protect our enterprises if it is established that individual trade partners have failed to abide by the rules."
"I call on the Commission to make consistent use of the existing - or even an improved - dispute-settlement procedure here if, in specific cases, no amicable settlement has been reached in the short term."
"We must focus our future efforts on ensuring that all trade partners abide by the rules."
"Only if all parties, without exception, abide by the rules, can people draw long-term benefit from world trade."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for a very comprehensive report on the safeguard action taken by third countries against the European Union."
"Unfortunately, a study of Mrs Muscardini's report and of the Commission's own report confirms that European trade policy gives undue consideration to protecting producers at the expense of consumers."
"This is particularly true of the agricultural sector."
"Import quotas, anti-dumping duties and administrative obstacles for agricultural products cost every European household approximately USD 1 500 a year."
"Clearly, there are occasions when it may be permissible to impose protective measures, but only in very limited and clearly defined cases."
"The circumstances in which they can be applied must be laid down in advance, and any decisions must be planned in good time and widely publicised, in order to enable entrepreneurs to make appropriate arrangements for their orders or supplies."
"Unfortunately, market players are currently still paying too high a price for poorly planned trading policies and for sudden decisions to apply protective rates, which cause legal and commercial uncertainty and make it more difficult for those involved in trading to adjust quickly to any changes."
"It is therefore very important for trade policy to be stable and predictable."
"Preferential rates need to be understandable and easy to apply."
"Their implementation should be widely discussed in advance with all trading partners, so that each entrepreneur is properly informed, and can feel certain of the future and of his or her orders."
"I would like to conclude by saying a few words about trade with developing countries, the World Trade Organisation and the European Union."
"Developing countries should be able to take advantage of all the opportunities arising from membership of the WTO."
"These countries should be treated as equal partners."
"It is therefore not acceptable for industrialised countries to protect the interests of large firms located mainly in the EU and in the USA."
"(EL) Mr President, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and thanked the Commissioner for his detailed statement, I should like to say by way of introduction that maintaining and strengthening the competitiveness of the European Union in the new globalised environment requires, firstly, increased European intervention in third country markets and, secondly, effective protection from unfair trading practices by our partners."
"The Community - and this has already been said - is still firmly a moderate user of trade defence instruments."
"On the other hand, the constant increase in trade defence instruments against the Community is taking on worrying proportions."
"The Union is - and must remain - an open market to international competition."
"We are against protectionism."
"At the same time, however, we are against distorting competition and against our partners' achieving competitive advantages by relying on underhand practices in infringement of international trade rules."
"There is no sense in unilateral disarmament by the Union."
"Trade 'pacifism' operates only when applied by all parties. No one disputes that we are seeing increased use of trade defence instruments against the Community."
"This being so, the Commission should keep a close watch and ensure that abusive and non-compliant measures are withdrawn, either through consultations and/or by taking recourse to the judicial bodies of the WTO as and where needed."
"We are also seeing a comparatively large number of trade defence instruments against European agricultural products."
"It is therefore the Commission's responsibility to ensure that the radical reforms of the CAP are taken into adequate account by our trade partners when activating anti-subsidy measures."
"Mr President, I have never been a unilateral disarmer at any stage in my political career, in any context."
"I have always been a multilateralist, whether it be in respect of disarmament or the putting in place of international rules to create institutions of global governance or in the design of processes to create agreements or to solve disputes in the world."
"I bring those principles and that approach to this subject as I have done to others throughout my political career."
"We have heard a call this evening for moral leadership."
"The morality that I bring to this subject of trade is my belief in free trade."
"I say it is moral because I believe that free trade is the best way to drive economic growth, to lever up living standards, to create opportunities for people and to attack poverty in our world."
"That is what I call 'moral'."
"However, one of the ways in which we 'morally' pursue free trade is by standing up for fair trade."
"When I look around me and see the public disquiet, uncertainty and unhappiness about what is going on in the global economy and the sense that people feel increasingly insecure and threatened by the dramatic changes that are taking place in the architecture and landscape of the global economy, I see people beginning to question whether free trade is a good idea."
"I see them beginning to wonder whether sheltering from the global economy would be better; whether erecting barriers between us and our trading partners might not be a better way of securing our jobs and our livelihoods."
"I make a very strong argument against that reaction and instinct, but I will never help that argument against protectionism if I am seen to be or thought to be weak when it comes to standing up for the upholding and implementation of internationally agreed trade rules which stand out against anti-competitive behaviour, state interventions or trade distortions, which are designed to give one trading partner an unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable advantage in trade against another."
"That is why it is appropriate and proper to operate trade defence instruments within the rules created by our multilateral institutions."
"However, I would never want to see those rules used as a weapon against others' low-cost competition or against others' legitimate use of their comparative advantage."
"That is not right and it is not acceptable, but nor, if I may say to Mr Kamall, was that the case either in respect of textiles or shoes."
"Shoes, yes, was an anti-dumping measure, arrived at after considerable investigation, analysis, recommendation, discussion, debate and finally decision amongst our Member States, as it properly should be."
"I would stand by the objectivity and the transparency with which that decision was arrived at, and it certainly was not adopted for protectionist purposes."
"However, in the case of textiles, I never said it was unfair trading."
"I never said that the fierce competition that we were facing in the case of textiles was as a result of price or market distortions by the Chinese."
"I merely pointed to the fact that with the final lifting of quotas we in Europe were suddenly and unexpectedly faced with what amounted to an avalanche which, if it had not been resisted, would have had the likely effect of burying our market and severely distorting what people produce, how people sell, their profits, their livelihoods and, therefore, their jobs in such a sudden way that I believed it was appropriate - and, in the end, our Chinese trading partners also agreed that it was right and appropriate - to take voluntary cooperative measures to slow down the rapid increase in Chinese textile exports."
"You are right that at all times, on all occasions and in all cases we should operate impartiality, transparency and truthfulness in the analysis we put forward, the conclusions we reach and how we seek to justify the measures we are advocating."
"It is true, as Mrs Handzlik said, that any intervention of any sort in the market - legitimate, anti-dumping or other uses of trade defence instruments - is bound to create some uncertainty and weaken the ability of businesses to plan ahead."
"Mr Kamall made a similar point."
"I take this very seriously indeed, because I do not want my actions, as agreed by the Member States, to have the effect of making a bad situation worse by further disrupting or undermining the ability of companies to plan ahead and to organise their production, which, of course, is hampered if supply and production chains are undermined or disrupted by interventions such as these."
"Therefore we must minimise the disruption."
"One of the things I want to take very seriously in the context of our Green Paper and our examination of this matter, is how we can minimise disruption and offer the greatest possible predictability to companies that might be affected."
"I just want to make this last point: Mr Caspary said - if I may elaborate on and embroider his words slightly - that we should keep to the rules and at all times seek to strengthen and improve them."
"I agree with that."
"That is precisely what we are doing in the DDA and why we have a multilateral system and process governing these rules and an institution that enables us to negotiate precisely the strengthening and the improvement that you advocate."
"That is why the WTO system is so important."
"I would just like to say in conclusion that, whatever disruptions, interventions, distractions or diversions we have in a trade agenda which is very wide and very complex, I will always keep my eyes very carefully focused on the DDA, the importance of the agenda we are pursuing in the DDA and the vital importance of bringing those negotiations to a successful completion."
"I want to do that in respect not only of market access but also of trade rules and their strengthening, and that is what the Commission remains dedicated to achieving."
"The debate is closed."

"Peace process in Spain (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the peace process in Spain."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, the European Community was born out of a quest for peace and stability."
"Peace and stability are still a resource for the development of the Union and it is very important that these matters are also discussed."
"It is especially natural for the European Parliament to discuss the principles of peace and stability."
"On 23 and 24 March this year, the Spanish Prime Minister gave the European Council an account of the announcement of a permanent ceasefire by the terrorist organisation, ETA."
"At the time the Council said that it was satisfied with the account given by the Spanish Prime Minister."
"Since then, the Council has not discussed the issue and abides by its statement of the time."
"The issue of security is a particularly topical one, and one that affects all Europeans."
"The Finnish Presidency is satisfied with all the actions that have been put in place to ensure that ETA ceases its terrorist activity and to bring about a peaceful solution within the framework of Spain's democratic organs of government."
"As we in this Chamber all know, the Union is active in weeding out terrorism and its causes."
"The Council once again expresses its support for the action which the Member States have implemented and are implementing to combat terrorism in accordance with the principles of the rule of law."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, terrorism represents one of the worst imaginable threats to democratic societies."
"Terrorist attacks not only endanger security but constitute an assault on the fundamental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The Commission is strongly committed to the fight against terrorism and intends to continue working for the prevention of terrorism and the protection of our citizens and infrastructures by bringing terrorists to justice and by responding adequately to terrorist attacks in order to save as many innocent lives as possible."
"The specific measures that will be taken at European level are clearly outlined in the European counter-terrorist strategy and in the action plan on combating terrorism."
"The Commission is obviously deeply concerned at the dramatic scale of ETA's terrorism in Spain; four decades of terrorist activity have seen more than 800 assassinations and other attacks, with economic extortion and blackmail becoming common practice."
"Law-abiding citizens have learned to live in fear; many have been permanently threatened in their daily lives."
"The serious crime committed yesterday in the south of France - probably by ETA, according to the French prosecutor - is a source of concern."
"The attitude of Spanish society during all these years has been exemplary; indeed, its tenacity and conviction in combating terrorism through respect for democracy and the rule of law has paid off, leading to the increasing weakness of ETA."
"The Commission, once again, pays tribute to all the victims of ETA's terrorist attacks and recalls the importance of helping them and helping to make good damages suffered."
"In these circumstances, the Commission recalls the statement made in its presence by the European Council in March 2006, welcoming the report of the Spanish Prime Minister on the announcement of a permanent ceasefire by terrorist group ETA."
"The Commission also recalls the statement made by the President of the European Commission on the announcement by the Spanish Prime Minister on the launch of a dialogue with ETA, sharing the hopes of all those who look to a future in which Spain is free from the scourge of terrorism."
"The Commission is most hopeful that those announcements will result in the total disarmament and dissolution of the terrorist group."
"At the same time, the Commission is aware of the complexity of the initiative, as well as the extreme sensitivity of the matter, but is convinced that Spain, through all its democratic institutions, will find the right path that will bring an end to ETA's terrorism and restore peace, with full respect for the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"We shall not be divided today, since we shall not forget that the target of this debate is a common enemy of Spain and of Europe: terrorism."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of the most noble tasks of a politician to work for peace."
"We all want peace on Earth, in Europe and in Spain."
"There are, however, often differences of opinion about how to achieve this objective. This is the case again today."
"This debate is not about party-political tactics and gains, but principles and fundamental convictions."
"For this reason I ask that everyone here show great respect in this debate today and that we do not deny each other the mutual good will that sustains our conviction."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to know how it is that we can trust that ETA and Batasuna want peace when they have not expressed a single word of regret or apology or made any kind of appeal for forgiveness to the families of the over 800 people that they have murdered."
"Until this occurs, we must expect that they will begin to kill again if they do not achieve their goals through negotiation."
"Today, our sympathy, our respect and our solidarity are with the victims of the acts of terrorism and violence carried out by ETA and Batasuna."
"I can see from here our highly esteemed fellow MEP Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, whose husband, the then Chairman of the Socialist Party in the Basque Country, was murdered in 1984."
"Several attempts have been made on the life of Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, and seven of his political associates from the Partido Popular in the Basque Country have been murdered."
"We owe it to the victims to ensure that the murderers are punished. This is in accordance with the guiding and basic principles of our system of states under the rule of law."
"If it is to be credible, the process of reconciliation must begin with reconciliation between perpetrators and victims, including the victims' descendants."
"We call upon ETA and Batasuna to give your victims - who are surely on your consciences - a sign of conciliation and of apology."
"We would remind people that ETA and Batasuna are on the EU's list of terrorist organisations."
"They have not surrendered their weapons."
"These weapons remain a threat to the constitutional order of Spain, as well as of France and thereby of the whole of Europe."
"The Commissioner has reminded us of the events of the day before yesterday in Nimes."
"A woman and two children were taken hostage and the French authorities have stated officially that this took place as part of an ETA weapons robbery."
"In other words, weapons remain an instrument of political argument."
"We have to ask ourselves what goal ETA and Batasuna are trying to achieve."
"A statement was issued on Euronews on 24 October from a high-ranking representative of ETA and Batasuna."
"The statement said that weapons would not be surrendered until the Basque Country was - in their words - independent."
"MEPs have received a letter from Batasuna, which states in English, 'Regarding the negotiation between ETA and the Spanish and French states it will be them who decide all about the demilitarisation of the conflict.'"
"This form of words is a bad sign, since, if the negotiations fail, the blame is already being laid at the doors of the Spanish and French states."
"What we in the PPE-DE Group, have to say to this is that we want dialogue."
"Spain and France are free and democratic states."
"They are not dictatorships, they are not tyrannies, against which one may express resistance through violent means."
"No, they are free states, and in free and democratic states it is democratic dialogue and not violence that must be used."
"As we share this conviction at the deepest level, our group, the PPE-DE Group, has tabled a resolution."
"It is not merely a resolution on the part of our Spanish allies in the Partido Popular, it is a common resolution on the part of the whole of our group, and we will defend it with solidarity and now, today, and in this debate, commemorate the victims."
"(Applause from the right)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of terrorism in Spain is not a Spanish internal problem; it is a European problem."
"Terrorism is an attack on our values."
"Terrorism is always an attack on everything that we in this Parliament defend on the basis of our common European convictions."
"No terrorism, absolutely none, is justified."
"It is for all of us to find ways out of this terrorism because we are all - when it is our values that we are defending - victims of this terrorism too, every time a terrorist attack takes place."
"Mr Poettering, commendably, made reference to my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, who is herself a victim."
"We have many people with us in the public gallery today from the Basque Country who themselves were and are victims in that they have lost loved ones or in that they have personally suffered injury to life and limb."
"They are here listening to us today because they want to say 'yes' to the route of dialogue because it is only through dialogue that the spiral of violence can be ended."
"I admire men and women who must have experienced the deep sorrow that these victims have been through and who nevertheless come out and demand an end to the death, to the violence and to the downward spiral."
"This moral force must be the impetus to reach a solution to the problems of violence, not only in the Basque Country, but everywhere else too."
"It is thus a European problem that we are discussing today."
"I admire the courage of the Spanish Government in choosing this path, a path that is controversial and fraught with risks."
"It is, however, a path that is best described by a quotation that I would like to read to you."
"(ES) For the sake of peace and your rights, we shall not close ourselves off but, rather, we shall open ourselves up to peace, hope, forgiveness and generosity and we shall do the best we can to ensure that peace is lasting with the help and hope of everybody."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) What I have just read out to you is a wonderful sentence that describes what this is all about."
"It is a sentence uttered by the Spanish Prime Minister who sent his Secretary of State off to negotiate with ETA. It is a sentence spoken by the Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar in 1998."
"That is the spirit that can form the basis for us all to reach a common solution to this problem of violence, since what the Spanish Government is doing today is in the tradition of all the governments before it."
"(Applause)"
"It would therefore be a good thing if we were able to attain a joint resolution."
"I do not always agree with Mr Aznar, which will not surprise you to hear, but on this issue he was right, dear members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and dear members of the Partido Popular, he was your party leader, after all. In this spirit we can agree, as one, that we are prepared, for the sake of such a fundamental right and through dialogue, to find a solution."
"Mr President, when Members of this House had to deal with terrorism in the past, they were always aware of the risks."
"When John Hume und David Trimble, Members of this House, set off together on the road to peace they were also aware that it is a road fraught with risk and that there is no guarantee of success."
"The gun heist in France yesterday - which we condemn in the strongest possible terms - shows that if you want to get out of the cycle of violence there is always the risk that someone will attempt to use violent means to block your road out of the deadlock."
"You cannot afford to be forced off this road, because what is the alternative?"
"Remaining deadlocked means perpetuating the violence."
"The dialogue that has been entered into is thus a great opportunity, and I implore all of you, let us adopt this dialogue together on a common platform supported by all the groups."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the European Union has been referred to as the greatest example of conflict resolution in history."
"We must be concerned with the remaining conflicts at home, just as we are concerned with conflicts beyond our Union."
"It is not for us in the European Parliament to intervene directly between the Spanish Government, political parties and the long-running conflict in the Basque country, but nor can we turn a blind eye."
"We should encourage what may be the best prospect for peace in a generation."
"I extend my solidarity and sympathy to all those families who have been bereaved of loved ones over the years as a result of the violence."
"But surely the most appropriate response that we, as democratic politicians, can bring to those countless victims is to ensure that there will be no more victims."
"It is for that reason that Liberals and Democrats lend their backing to the resolution before the House today."
"It is neither a time nor a subject for political point-scoring."
"It is my firm belief that all democratic forces who wish to see a peaceful end to violence and terror in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain where atrocities have been committed should back the endeavours of whichever Spanish government is prepared to work to that end."
"Earlier this year, this House welcomed the announcement of an ETA ceasefire."
"It is right that we now build on that and engage a process that entrenches it, without prejudging or commenting on the outcome of any political dialogue or settlement."
"As with the Northern Ireland peace process, which is not identical but offers some important lessons for conflict resolution, it is occasionally necessary for politicians to take a risk for peace."
"I recall that our former colleague John Hume and his Unionist counterpart David Trimble were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, following the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland."
"They took a risk for peace."
"This is not to hand a victory to the terrorists, as some would suggest, but rather to hand them a defeat."
"For there can be no dialogue among democrats if one of the parties still maintains the intent to kill."
"We should not imagine that building the house of peace will be easy."
"There will be setbacks, such as the discovery of a cache of weapons in south-west France."
"But it is our duty to build the house of peace with the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence."
"That is why my group appeals to all sides of this House today to set aside party politics and unite for the prospects of peace, as much as we stand together in revulsion at acts of terrorism."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the process opened up in Spain to finally put an end to the terrorism of ETA and find a solution to the Basque conflict."
"At the same time we reiterate our profound solidarity and respect for all of the victims of terrorism."
"We support this process because it rejects violence, it leaves all options for a final solution open, it is not exclusive and it also gives the Basque political parties and Basque society in general responsibility in terms of putting an end to the so-called Basque conflict."
"Debating this issue in the European Parliament does not mean interfering in the policy of a Member State. It simply means promoting a process already underway and restating that terrorism and violence affects all Europeans."
"However difficult this process may be and however unsure its result, we support and we will continue to support those people who have decided to run the risk of taking a different direction to that of the Aznar Government, which quite clearly did not achieve any real results."
"As Gandhi stated, 'There is no path to peace. Peace is the path'."
"We believe that it is appropriate to debate this process here and we have always been in favour of doing so, even when the People's Party was determined to bring this conflict to the European Parliament in order to gain support for its policy, a policy that we always believed to be mistaken, because it was based on the idea that, in order to defeat terrorism, it was necessary to divide Basque society rather than unite it."
"The Basques and the majority of Spaniards are tired of this policy of confrontation."
"In our view, the key factors for the success of this process are dialogue, non-violence and respect for the citizens of the Basque country's right to decide."
"With these objectives in mind, we are going to support this process, as firm friends and allies in the fight against terrorism, against all forms of terrorism."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, my group has always condemned terrorist acts, whoever the perpetrators and whatever the scale of the acts and the reasons given to justify them."
"We are in favour of political struggle, with the exclusion of all forms of violence."
"We see violence as reprehensible in all circumstances except where, as provided for by the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a population, in the absence of the rule of law is 'compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression'."
"Even in this case, attacks on civilians are, in our opinion, to be prohibited."
"All the more reason for our having unreservedly and systematically condemned the attacks by ETA, which have killed hundreds of innocent people."
"We continue to remember these victims and express once again our solidarity with their loved ones."
"For a long time, we have been hoping that this chapter could be closed, once and for all."
"We were therefore extremely pleased to welcome the announcement of the permanent ceasefire by ETA."
"We therefore also greatly appreciate the open and responsible attitude with which the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Zapatero, has taken this opportunity to endeavour to achieve peace, in particular in his speech on 28 June 2005, by choosing the path of dialogue while taking care to respect the laws and legal procedures in force in his country."
"The European Parliament would be honoured to lend its support to this move."
"It is in this spirit that the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has united with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe through a joint resolution."
"I would add that we believe it would be a good thing for MEPs from other groups to also lend their support to a move that is nothing short of a reflection of the wishes of the majority of Spanish people, namely that a peace process be opened, based on legal grounds."
"(Applause from the left)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in saying that today is a very sensitive occasion for us in Parliament."
"In all our deliberations we have to remember the victims of terrorist violence and, today in particular, the victims of ETA violence in Spain over the last few years."
"But we must also look to the future and ensure that there are no more victims, because political solutions will be found to the differences in Spain, France, and the European Union as a whole."
"I believe it is wrong to draw parallels or to say all processes are exactly the same."
"However, previous peace processes can act as a guide to what might happen, the kind of difficulties to be overcome and the challenges to be faced."
"If dialogue is to succeed, both sides must be open."
"You cannot talk about a future process with one hand tied behind your back."
"You have to ensure that those with whom you have a dialogue are committed to reaching a compromise and finding a solution."
"And the most important thing to remember is that when you go into a peace process you have to make peace with your enemies, not with your friends, and that can create a lot of internal difficulties."
"(Applause)"
"The opportunities now presented to us by this process should be grasped, but it should not be predetermined that everybody gets what they want."
"It is most important that we do not point the finger of blame at someone else from the Popular Party or from the Socialist Party, but encourage the main forces of democracy in Spain to unite in finding a solution for all of the people of Spain and not to be driven down the road of division and dissension."
"That is not in any way to undermine or to ignore the suffering people have gone through."
"Can any of us imagine what it would be like to lose a loved one because of a so-called political cause?"
"We in Ireland know what that is like - there have been 3 000 victims of terrorist violence in Ireland over the last 30 years - and yet we could find a way forward and bring extreme opinions together."
"An opportunity does present itself if people genuinely want to act."
"Opportunity comes to pass but not to pause."
"Let us seize the opportunity and give our support."
"(Applause from the left and the centre)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, my group does not wish to involve itself in Spanish domestic politics, but there are principles of international law to which all countries are obliged to adhere."
"Sometimes, they do not provide a clear answer."
"The right of peoples to self-determination is an inviolable principle."
"Every people has the right to chose its own fate."
"Every nation has the right to its own country."
"There are, however, only around 10 to 12 countries in the world where people, nation and geographical unit combine to form a higher unit."
"Everywhere else it is a question of negotiating solutions that are respected by the different peoples and nations that share the same territorial unit."
"The EU does not interfere in the forms of government of the Member States."
"This is an area in which they themselves have competence, whether they wish to have a unitary state, a federal community or devolved arrangements or to be divided into multiple states."
"The states must protect minorities and respect human rights."
"National discrimination is not permitted."
"So what can the EU do in the Basque Country to end terrorism and ensure a durable solution with peace and tolerance?"
"We can encourage our fellow MEPs from Spain to find a negotiated solution and we can provide an economic carrot - financial support for economic development, jobs, training and education instead of terrorism."
"I come from the border region between Denmark and Germany, where we have had wars and hatred for centuries."
"My grandfather was a German soldier with Danish sympathies."
"My father was conceived in Germany, but born in Denmark after Northern Schleswig rejoined Denmark following a referendum."
"Our national leader, Hans Peter Hansen, was a moderate who did not want areas that had German sympathies to rejoin Denmark, as Germany was on its knees after the First World War."
"What a stroke of luck!"
"The reconciliation between Danes and Germans began, and now everyone recognises the border."
"Denmark grants the German minority more rights than it grants to Danes, and the same applies to the Danish minority in Germany, an example being exemption from the 5% electoral hurdle to qualification for parliamentary representation."
"Recognition, respected rights, special rights - these are the keys to understanding and lasting peace."
"As a boy, a German-owned shop was not somewhere that I could buy things."
"Today, that seems incredible, and I now work with both the German minority in Denmark and the Danish minority in Germany."
"We drew up together the proposal for the protection of minorities in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I hope that the Basques and the other peoples of Spain will be able to reconcile their differences."
"The means of achieving reconciliation between Denmark and Germany proved to be a referendum on special rights."
"Referendums do not hurt as much as bullets and gunpowder."
"It is indeed possible to put the past behind you."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, coming from Northern Ireland, which has experienced what at times was euphemistically called a peace process, I see uncanny parallels and lessons to be learned."
"ETA-Batasuna and IRA-Sinn Féin are both revolutionary Marxist-based organisations intent on foisting their will and ideology on a civilian population through vicious violence as and when required."
"It is not surprising that deep terrorist links have existed between them."
"Both, moreover, are expert in hijacking the language of peace, while glorying in past and even continuing exploits of terror as they adeptly dodge from one phase of struggle to another."
"Learn from our mistakes."
"In 1994 the IRA announced a ceasefire, which proved merely tactical as 18 months later they launched the infamous Canary Wharf bombing attack and dipped in and out of terror as it suited."
"In 1998 they promised to decommission within two years, and yet it was not until 2005 that they made any notable delivery."
"They were foolishly and prematurely admitted to government in Northern Ireland, only to launch their 'Stormontgate' spy ring within that government."
"In late 2004 they purported to engage in genuine political negotiations while, at the same time, planning the biggest heist in UK history - the Northern Bank robbery - and weeks later IRA men murdered Robert McCartney."
"Now they want back into government, but think they should keep their Army Council."
"Therefore, do not be taken in by mere proclamations of commitments to peace by those whose stock in trade is duplicity and mayhem!"
"Test them long and test them hard, or you too will have your goodwill exploited."
"To conclude this debate, two motions for resolutions have been presented pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m. after the formal sitting with the President of the Republic of Hungary."
"Results of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lahti, 20 October 2006) (debate)"
"The next item is the European Council report and Commission statement on the results of the informal summit of Heads of State or Government in Lahti on 20 October 2006."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 20 October, I had the pleasure to host the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in Lahti and the dinner that followed it, where the Russian President Vladimir Putin was our guest."
"Both the meeting of Heads of State or Government and the dinner organised after it were a great success."
"These informal meetings of EU leaders are an excellent way of building political consensus to take the Union forward with regard to its key challenges."
"At the summit we focused particularly on external energy relations."
"We also discussed immigration and the situation in Sudan/Darfur."
"A separate working session was devoted to ways of promoting innovation policy to guarantee the Union's competitiveness and economic growth."
"Developing innovation policy is crucial to EU competitiveness and our ability to keep good jobs in Europe."
"The open and thorough discussions during the working lunch enabled us to close ranks for the dinner, despite the doubts that had existed in certain quarters."
"The atmosphere over lunch was excellent and the solidarity among the Member States could definitely be felt."
"We attached a great deal of importance to speaking with one voice, and I would like to call this determination to reach consensus the Spirit of Lahti."
"The discussion over dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin was very honest and frank."
"In addition to energy issues, we also discussed topical international issues and freedom of expression in Russia."
"The meeting of Heads of State or Government held a comprehensive and broad debate on energy."
"The atmosphere was excellent and the basic message, despite slight differences in tone, coherent."
"The main topics were the principles for developing EU-Russian energy relations and their execution, closer relations with strategically important third countries, the fight against climate change through energy policy; and more effective exchange of information through a network of energy correspondents."
"With regard to EU-Russian energy relations, we agreed that there is a need for closer partnership."
"It should be based on the principles laid down in the Energy Charter and the G8 Declaration, in particular openness, market-based solutions and reciprocity."
"These principles should already be applied now in practice and they should also be incorporated in concrete form into the forthcoming EU-Russia Agreement."
"At Lahti we laid down a common policy for EU-Russia energy relations."
"There was also consensus at Lahti that we should continue and step up our efforts to forge closer relations with producer and transit countries in the Union's neighbourhood by the end of the year."
"The goal is to apply the principles governing the internal market as widely as possible in neighbouring regions of the Union."
"Climate change was referred to in many addresses as the most urgent international challenge."
"The EU must, in particular, demonstrate leadership in the promotion of sustainable energy."
"As regards innovations and technologies that relate to energy efficiency, European companies have a lot to offer."
"We shared the view that issues of energy and climate should in future feature prominently at EU summits with developing world countries, as they have during Finland's EU Presidency."
"If a reliable supply of energy is to be secured, there needs to be huge investment in transmission networks and other infrastructure."
"Therefore, cooperation with international financial institutions must be stepped up in energy infrastructure projects."
"Energy security must be one of the criteria taken into account when European Investment Bank lending mandates are being granted to developing world countries."
"It is important for the Union to have comprehensive information on which to base its energy policy decisions and responses to external problem situations."
"We agreed in Lahti that we should try to make swift progress in the establishment of a network of energy correspondents by the end of the year."
"The details are to be agreed by the Council."
"Improving the way information is collected and analysed will help increase cooperation between the Member States and institutions, and make for greater solidarity on energy issues."
"Discussions at the summit on external energy relations will also prepare the ground for the next spring European Council, which is to adopt a prioritised Action Plan on Energy Policy for Europe."
"At the working session of the meeting of Heads of State or Government, we discussed how to move forward on innovation policy."
"The main topics were intellectual property rights, particularly patents, cooperation between the corporate world and the public sector, the European Institute of Technology, and standards."
"We agreed that the Union needs a clear strategy on intellectual property rights."
"The Competitiveness Council will provide the Commission with more details of what it would like to see in the area of intellectual property rights."
"At Lahti, we stressed that the Commission proposal should look in particular at the quality of the intellectual property rights system."
"The Commission will put forward its proposal before the spring European Council."
"One of the very strong messages from Lahti was that the European patent system must be made more cost-effective and easier to predict."
"Litigation systems also need improving."
"We need to try and move ahead quickly on this."
"Towards the end of the year, the Commission will issue a communication containing concrete proposals on the development of the European patent system."
"When it has received the Commission's proposal, the Council will consider the various options."
"The issue of how to make the patent system more effective has been a difficult one for the Council, but it is vitally important for our capacity for innovation to develop the European system."
"I personally think that everyone should bear the common interest in mind, be prepared to show flexibility rather than stubbornness with regard to national positions, and agree to simplify the language regime, for example."
"We also agreed that we needed to promote cooperation between the corporate world and the private sector."
"The European Technology Platforms and Joint Technology Initiatives are good tools for developing key technologies."
"If we are to make progress, it is important that the EU's Seventh Framework Programme be adopted without delay."
"The programme should also be a source of EU funding for Joint Technology Initiatives."
"I am very pleased that the Lahti meeting confirmed that Artemis, one of the most advanced technology platforms, will be taken further, and that the Commission's desire to implement it as a Joint Technology Initiative, is to be endorsed."
"Businesses in the sector are investing huge sums in the joint initiative."
"The Finnish Government too has set a good example here, promising to contribute EUR 70 million over a seven-year period."
"Over all, Artemis is one of Europe's biggest Joint Technology Initiatives, in a very important and promising technological field."
"Last week, the Commission put forward a legislative proposal concerning the European Institute of Technology."
"Lahti gave the go-ahead for a swift and detailed examination of the proposal by the Council."
"I see this as a very valuable initiative and I think that it could bring genuine added value to the development of research cooperation between universities and business."
"Lastly in this area, I would like to mention standardisation, a subject which we also touched upon at our meeting."
"As I have already stressed before, standardisation is very important in the lives of the Union's citizens."
"For example, introducing the Europe-wide GSM standard phones made it possible for Europe to become the world leader in the field."
"If Europe cannot agree on good standards, others will set them."
"We all know that innovation can deliver success and growth, but the problem has been how to take concrete steps forward."
"The guidance we received at Lahti will now help us to make progress in creating the kind of environment that promotes competitiveness."
"Our discussion on immigration highlighted the commitment to cooperation and the matter of solidarity amongst the Member States in solving immigration problems."
"It is a matter that concerns the whole Union."
"While we require rapid, short-term action to deal with the acute crisis that we are seeing, our discussions also emphasised the need for a coherent and comprehensive policy on immigration."
"The policy should address both legal and illegal immigration."
"We also need to do more to help immigrants to integrate."
"The need for close cooperation with African countries, as well as other countries of origin and transit, was particularly apparent."
"The best way of dealing with the pressure on people to leave their country is promoting development, in Africa and elsewhere."
"The meeting gave its full support to the work being done by the EU's border management agency, and it was acknowledged that more resources were needed to bolster its work."
"The meeting also spoke of the need to develop our decision-making system, to enable the Union to respond promptly and more effectively to urgent problems."
"Thank you for the strong and thorough contribution you made at Lahti, Mr President."
"You made it very clear that the European Parliament wants more effective decision-making in the field of justice and home affairs."
"The Finnish Presidency shares this view fully."
"(Applause)"
"The theme of immigration will be dealt with again by the justice and home affairs ministers and the foreign ministers."
"We will be returning to the issue at the December European Council."
"We also spoke in Lahti about the grave situation in Sudan/Darfur."
"We expressed our deep concern about the humanitarian situation and human rights in Darfur."
"As representative of the Presidency of the Council, I will be passing this urgent message on to the Sudanese President."
"We must keep up the pressure on the Sudanese Government to bring an end to the fighting, enable the UN to mount a peace-keeping operation and start negotiations with the rebels."
"The informal discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin were extremely useful for the development of our strategic partnership."
"That involves eagerness to cooperate and being prepared to discuss all issues."
"The partnership should not be seen as static but as an ongoing process."
"We believe that a genuine and lasting partnership has to be built on common values."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you too for your contribution to our dinner debate and for the support which you expressed regarding this crucial matter."
"Values are the foundation of everything."
"In our discussions with President Putin, we talked about how we could promote the goals of energy cooperation through a new agreement."
"Our talks will also pave the way for the EU-Russia Summit in November."
"The intention is that an agreement will be reached at the Helsinki Summit on the commencement of negotiations on a new and comprehensive EU-Russia pact."
"On international issues, we agreed with President Putin that we would try to establish closer cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"The need for closer cooperation has been demonstrated very clearly by recent events in Iran, North Korea and the Middle East."
"Over dinner, I brought up the shocking murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya."
"I told President Putin that people in the Member States were worried that the situation regarding freedom of speech and expression in Russia had taken a turn for the worse."
"Speaking for the Union, I said that this murder, which had deeply shocked us all, should be investigated and those responsible brought to justice."
"I also mentioned our concerns regarding Chechnya."
"Relations between Russia and Georgia were also brought up."
"I told President Putin that the Union was concerned about increasing tension and said that the Union was prepared to act to find a solution to the crisis."
"We are building a strategic, tangible partnership with Russia on an extremely wide front within the framework of the 'common spaces'."
"The most prominent themes during Finland's presidential term are: energy, the environment, transport, justice and home affairs and human rights."
"The European Union must be able to speak to its partners with one voice."
"Divided and disunited, we are weak."
"We will not be able to look after our interests or promote the values on which the Union is built."
"At Lahti, we succeeded in showing President Putin that the Union is determined and united in its opinions."
"Representing the Presidency of the Council as I do, I am proud of this achievement, and I think that we have taken a step forward in our relations with Russia."
"This does not mean that Russia agrees with us on everything."
"We actually had a long discussion, in which President Putin answered our questions in detail and also looked for weaknesses in the EU's action."
"We are used to this with Russia; it is part of normal dialogue."
"The crucial question now, in the wake of the Lahti meeting, is how we translate words into action and move forward on the issues that we discussed."
"We are relying on the preparatory channels which we normally employ."
"Most of the work will be done in the Council on the basis of Commission initiatives."
"For many issues we will draw on the policy guidelines we have received in the remaining weeks of our presidential term."
"The European Parliament will also have a central role to play in accelerating action on what was agreed on at Lahti."
"Thank you for this opportunity to present to you the results of the Lahti informal meeting of Heads of State or Government."
"I will be glad to answer any questions which my introduction to the subject may have given rise to."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Commission."
"Mr President, Prime Minister Vanhanen has given you a comprehensive overview of the results of the informal European Council in Lahti last Friday."
"I should like to concentrate on a few points."
"The Lahti summit should be seen as part of a process."
"As you know, we have been saying that we should drive forward integration through practical, concrete actions and we have been doing so, hand in hand with Parliament and the Council."
"We have set out an ambitious agenda, for example on security, on energy, on research, and now we must put that agenda into action."
"That is precisely what we did at Lahti."
"Firstly, on innovation, everyone agrees that innovation is important and that Europe is lagging behind."
"There is a consensus on the need for more support and incentives for innovation and fewer barriers for innovators."
"That has been endorsed in the European Council and in resolutions from this Parliament."
"What we needed were some clear, practical steps to show that Europe was prepared to take a lead and that is what we got at Lahti."
"On joint technology initiatives, for example, key projects such as the Artemis Programme on embedded computers were being held back by a lack of national funds."
"Now we have some clear commitments for direct support."
"On procedures to set European standards for products, we have an agreement that these should be speeded up."
"I also believe that momentum is building up on intellectual property, including patents, and the Commission will push that further before the end of the year."
"Importantly, the Commission received the green light on the European Institute for Technology (EIT)."
"I am grateful for the support I received from all the Members who spoke in favour of the EIT in the part-session two weeks ago."
"There is a growing consensus that the EIT will offer European leadership on innovation."
"We are receiving enthusiastic support from all over the business and scientific community in Europe."
"The attention given by Parliament to that important initiative has been of real help in developing the details of the proposal."
"Of course there will now be negotiations on details, including the budget."
"I look forward to working with you and the Council in order to move swiftly towards adoption of the regulation."
"I believe that the EIT can be a flagship of excellence in innovation for Europe."
"We should ask the EIT to make its first priority the great challenges of climate change and everything related to environmentally-friendly sources of energy."
"That is an important task for us as a society."
"We should ask the scientific community of Europe to help us solve these problems, so that we can maintain the lead in what is perhaps the most important challenge of the 21st century."
"The second main issue in the debate was energy."
"The Commission, working closely with the Presidency, had identified three practical steps forward, and we received support for them all."
"First, the European Council agreed that we should step up our energy relations with our neighbours, especially producers like Russia, Norway or Algeria, and key transit countries like Turkey and Ukraine."
"Secondly, the European Council agreed to create a network of energy correspondents, which will also make us better prepared for unexpected shocks to our energy supply."
"Thirdly, the European Council agreed on a specific common approach to Russia."
"We made clear to President Putin our wish to have a close energy relationship with such a key partner, but that relationship must be based on the principles that Russia has already signed up to at the G8 hosted by Russia this year, as well as the energy charter: transparency, the rule of law, reciprocity and non-discrimination, along with market opening and market access."
"Those principles apply to energy, but not just energy."
"They are necessary elements in increasing the mutual confidence and investment essential to a long-term relationship."
"That message was all the more powerful in that we were united."
"In Lahti there was a clear sense of solidarity, an understanding that the European Union will act as one and that Europeans should receive the same standards of reliability from our Russian partners, whichever Member State is concerned."
"Prime Minister Vanhanen spoke on behalf of the whole European Council, presenting the general issues regarding our broad relations with Russia, and I was proud to have been asked to speak on energy matters."
"It was important for that meeting and for the success of the Lahti summit that the statements by the Presidency and by the European Commission were clearly supported by all members of the European Council."
"The idea of solidarity is more important than ever."
"Solidarity and coherence are more than ever the key words of our European Union."
"Going forward on energy, within the framework of our new global agreement with Russia, will help ensure that this common approach is maintained."
"In short, the message is getting through: energy is a European issue and needs European solutions."
"There is growing recognition in the Council of what you in Parliament have long known, i.e. that the European Union has a central role to play in creating energy security and, through energy policy, in tackling climate change."
"That bodes well for the energy package that the Commission will present in January."
"The European Union must not reduce its relationship with Russia to energy."
"At the dinner with President Putin, the European Union raised other issues: human rights, trade, visas, culture and common international concerns."
"We covered sensitive issues like Georgia."
"Prime Minister Vanhanen repeated the European Union's concern at the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, expressed so eloquently in our previous debate in the European Parliament."
"As we negotiate a new global agreement with Russia, this broad spread of issues must be maintained."
"That is the essence of a comprehensive agreement."
"Thirdly, at Lahti there was a short but important discussion on immigration."
"Again, there was a clear understanding that this was a collective problem, demanding a collective response."
"I was able to explain that in the coming weeks the Commission will be making proposals on how to improve maritime control of the Union's southern borders."
"We will also be updating the global approach on migration in the run-up to the December European Council and working to tackle the problem at source in the Euro-African Conference on Migration and Development next month."
"However, there is still much more that we could do in this area if the political will and determination is there to give us the tools and resources needed."
"In particular, we believe that our decision-making system should be adapted."
"We can already do that under the existing Treaties."
"We cannot go on waiting so long for decisions that are so often blocked because of the rule of unanimity."
"Let us be frank: it is completely absurd that in a common space of freedom of movement we still sometimes think in terms of 25 migration policies."
"We need a European policy on migration."
"(Applause)"
"Finally, Darfur was also discussed."
"I remain determined that we will do all we can to prevent another humanitarian tragedy."
"Therefore, Lahti was another signpost on our collective road towards equipping Europeans for globalisation."
"We will not be diverted from this path."
"The expectations of our citizens for a Europe of practical results are increasing."
"We must continue to respond."
"I am grateful to Mr Vanhanen for his excellent chairmanship and to the Finnish Presidency for our close cooperation."
"May it continue to the end of the Presidency and beyond."
"That is the way to achieve practical results for our Europe."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Prime Minister Vanhanen, President Barroso, in assessing the success of the Lahti meeting we may certainly work on the basis that its results are commendable."
"Things did not bode well for the summit."
"Many newspapers, the highly regarded Financial Times in particular, painted a very gloomy picture of the meeting in advance, saying that it was a big risk inviting Russian President Putin along, as the EU is divided and disunited on energy and Russian policy."
"It said that this would just be a victory for President Putin."
"Things turned out differently, however."
"It was good to see EU leaders acting in unison and speaking with solidarity over dinner."
"In speeches I have given here, I myself have said that the EU should have a united, unanimous, long-term policy on Russia."
"Now the first steps have succeeded in being taken."
"This will also show the public that the EU can act in difficult situations too."
"Obviously, we have to acknowledge that we still have a long way to go before things become concrete and Russia ratifies the Energy Charter, which will open up the market and enforce compliance with common rules."
"Although this was a small step forward, it was nevertheless an important step towards a uniform, long-term policy on Russia."
"It was also important that we ventured to speak openly about human rights and the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and not dodge the issues."
"We cannot sacrifice human rights on the altar of energy policy."
"The discussion was frank as far as President Putin was concerned too, even though he did not change his views."
"Hardly anyone expected him to either."
"Cooperation can only be built on mutual trust and a common will."
"Now a path has been opened up for greater cooperation on energy and other issues."
"What I missed at the dinner discussion with Putin was matters to do with the Baltic."
"This would have been an excellent opportunity to bring up with Russia the problems of the Baltic Sea."
"I understand, of course, that you cannot speak about everything over one dinner."
"In general conclusion regarding the Lahti Summit, may I say 'Well done, Prime Minister Vanhanen'."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with an observation about the Russian President Mr Putin, who featured prominently in Mr Vanhanen's speech and, Mr President of the Commission, in your own."
"The evening spent with him must have been a memorable one indeed."
"From the reports I hear, and from what I read, the meeting with President Putin was quite something."
"It is good, I feel, that Mr Putin is so frank."
"I have no problems with this and nor, for what it is worth, does my group."
"I would like, first of all, to say that when Mr Putin comments on the speech made by the President of this House, Mr Borrell Fontelles, he honours us."
"It shows that he has at least been listening."
"We never know, of course, if everyone is listening, but it does appear that Mr Putin has been."
"We do, however, reject comments that Mr Putin has made in relation to the speech where these are of an offensive nature, as the President of this House speaks for all its Members, and we thank him for what he said."
"(Applause)"
"Secondly, I would like to say that, yes, it is indeed a good thing for Mr Putin to speak about what he thinks of Italy. It is indeed a good thing for Mr Putin to speak about what he finds worthy of criticism in Spain."
"I believe these to be good things because European society is an open one."
"In our society anyone can criticise anything."
"This makes our society distinctly different from Russian society, where not everyone can voice criticisms of anything."
"(Applause)"
"It is therefore fruitful to have an open exchange of opinions with the Russian President."
"For that reason, we are also stating that what is happening in Chechnya is not right and that it must be condemned when human rights are breached and when people are degraded."
"I would also mention that Russian people too, including soldiers of the Russian army, are treated dishonourably there."
"It is, of course, completely obvious - we will be pointing this out in the resolution on the death of Anna Politkovskaya - that it is not possible to describe today's Russia, where journalists have to fear for their lives if they air grievances about their country, as a functioning democracy."
"That much is completely obvious."
"Thus, the open exchange of opinions on our part with Mr Putin and with all the Russians, and Russian politicians, that we come across is a part of our understanding of what it means to deal with people as partners."
"We do, after all, criticise what goes on in the United States."
"We reserve the right to criticise what goes on elsewhere in the world just as we ourselves may be subject to criticism."
"I am, then, also critical of the speeches made by Prime Minister Vanhanen and the President of the Commission, in which they promised many fine things."
"It all sounded so wonderful."
"You are, of course, aware of that, as I say it in every speech I make in relation to your remarks."
"Excellent!"
"Superb!"
"Once everything that you have described to us is implemented Europe really will be an El Dorado for technology, an El Dorado for training and qualification."
"We will be the knowledge-based society of the 21st, nay the 22nd, century."
"Superb!"
"Onwards, ever onwards!"
"I have to tell you, though, gentlemen, that the point will come at which you will have to deliver the goods!"
"So much for the announcements."
"Outstanding!"
"Except for the fact that - and this applies not only to you, least of all, indeed, to you, Mr President of the Commission, you who in fact make the right proposals, and who also seek to work towards the goals you announce - you in the Council, you, Mr Vanhanen, and the other Heads of State or Government, you must all put into practice what you have described in relation to energy policy, and that includes implementing it in your national energy plans."
"(Applause)"
"Moreover, I have to tell the House that, if you do not wish to be dependent on Russian energy, you must put an end to the waste of energy in Europe, in the US and in the industrialised nations of the world."
"If you want to limit climatic disasters, you must reduce CO2 emissions, and that will be accomplished, not by using natural gas from Russia, but rather through greater energy efficiency, through greater use of renewable energy, through power stations that make use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and through power plants with the highest level of efficiency."
"To do this, I might add, we will need more technology, and this is where we come full circle, back to the Lisbon process, for, if we want new technology, we need to invest in the minds of our people, in the universities."
"All that is true."
"It is just that we debate this time and again from scratch. Time and again, the same old things once more."
"Time and again, the same statements, and time and again, the same speech from me."
"This speech is not new either. I have already made it in modified form on numerous occasions."
"I have no desire to bore myself - not even with my own speeches. So, I beg you, let the announcements by the Commission and the Council at long last be backed up by actions."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, there is no resolution to discuss today."
"But then again there were no conclusions to the summit."
"My point is not that such occasions are not worthwhile: on the contrary, such is the need for greater action at European level that the Union could and should have four formal summits every year, as foreseen in the Treaty of Nice."
"What was on the menu at Lahti?"
"I refer not, Prime Minister, to the artichoke soup or the grilled goose that you served at supper, proving that you can supplant prosciutto di Parma, but to the EIT and the European patents, to energy security, to immigration, to relations with Russia - strategic themes which need serious reflection, but also strategic decisions which highlight the need for coherent policymaking."
"What is the use of a European technology university producing innovative ideas, if as a Union we are not able to agree a quick and easy patent registration system?"
"What is the hope for a collective climate change strategy if we are not prepared together radically to change our patterns of energy consumption and generation?"
"And what are the prospects for a common immigration policy if we fail to devise development and trade policies to bring relief from grinding poverty and misery?"
"Green Papers and action plans galore point the way forward but, like proverbial horses, Member States can be brought to water but not made to drink."
"That is why Europe is failing and that is why we need more, not less, Europe."
"My group salutes President Borrell and Prime Minister Vanhanen and the other Prime Ministers who raised the issue of Anna Politkovskaya's murder."
"If the invitation to President Putin and the publicity he received leaves many of us feeling distinctly ill at ease, the Finnish Presidency and the Finnish President are not to blame."
"The mistake was made when President Putin's country was invited to join the Council of Europe and the G-8, before anchoring the rule of law into its culture."
"Mr Putin, 'mafia' is not a Russian expression, but organizovanniye zhuliki is too often our impression of your country."
"The European Union should sign no partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia until freedom, transparency and the rule of law are established, along with the legal certainty for investors that flows from them."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lahti summit has demonstrated with great clarity that action on the international stage and internal political choices are ever more closely linked."
"We believe that supporting democratic Russia and those who, like Anna Politkovskaya, fought and continue to fight against the authoritarian drift of Mr Putin's system of power is perfectly consistent with the attempt to secure our continent's energy supply, compliance with the Kyoto protocol and the development of energy efficiency and renewable energies."
"Casting a veil of silence over the massacres in Chechnya, the closure of more than 90 non-governmental organisations, the arbitrary trials, targeted killings and growing corruption in order to obtain gas is not a winning strategy."
"In this regard, our group congratulates President Borrell. Nonetheless, we still respectfully state that we disagree with the clear support that he and the Finnish Government have given to reviving nuclear power."
"Whether we like it or not, there is a clear link between the so-called peaceful use of nuclear power and the proliferation of nuclear armaments - as shown plainly by the situation in Iran."
"There must not therefore be a trade-off between rights and energy."
"Events in the Ukraine and those which have taken place in Georgia more recently illustrate that appeasement does not increase Mr Putin's reliability, but only his determination to act in the sole interest of his power group."
"We have already lost much precious time on this issue; therefore we must not miss the significant opportunity presented by the expiry of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement at the end of the year."
"We would like to state now that we will be completely opposed to any attempt to remove conditionalities, and, in particular, the reference to the human rights clause of this agreement."
"We must develop a strategy which aims to reduce the unsustainability of consumption and the terrible inefficiency of our transport, construction and electricity systems, and which also aims decisively for excellence in our enterprises for the development of renewable energy."
"This is the best route to reducing our dependency and upholding peace, disarmament and democracy."
"I would also like to add a few words on another extremely important subject that has been discussed: the issue of immigration."
"I believe that in this regard, the barrier lies within the Council and between the Member States, because up to now they have not been able to tackle the issue of regulating legal immigration, to negotiate and provide funding at European level for serious cooperation agreements that can truly help developing countries not to be forced to send their best forces to our countries, and to guarantee that European policies, above all in the areas of fishing and agriculture, do not have a devastating effect that does nothing more than to drive even more people onto the boats along the coasts of both their countries and ours."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Prime Minister, Commissioner, the informal meeting at Lahti was originally convened to discuss EU competitiveness and innovation policy."
"This meeting will not have left any trace of these topics in EU history."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to Lahti to play solo with the EU orchestra."
"People wanted to speak to him about energy."
"At the same time it was an opportunity to talk about the country's human rights issues."
"Human rights and freedom of the media cannot be sidestepped when policy on Russia is being considered."
"It is nevertheless impossible to reach agreement with the country on these matters, just as it is impossible for a certain other superpower on the other side of the Atlantic to agree with anyone on ending the torture of prisoners of war or trying US citizens for war crimes in the International Court of Justice in The Hague."
"President Putin wants a strategic partnership for the EU and Russia."
"It reminds one of the strategic partnership between NATO and Russia and the institutional solutions adopted for it."
"Within this framework Russia is prepared to conduct a dialogue on energy and will even commit to a legally binding instrument."
"It remained unclear, however, as to whether this would then mean opening up markets on both sides or only in one direction."
"Moreover, if it were in one direction, which one would it be?"
"Lahti did not provide the answer, and the next time it is discussed will be at the EU-Russia Summit in November."
"The Lahti Summit was a kind of rehearsal for that."
"The country to hold the Presidency, Finland, receives gas from Russia more cheaply than other EU countries."
"Electricity for industry and households in Finland is among the cheapest in the EU."
"Harmonisation of the electricity markets in the EU would mean a rise in electricity prices in the country which Prime Minister Vanhanen represents, while in a few countries prime ministers would certainly rejoice over a common energy policy of that sort."
"Mr Vanhanen's Government used the Lahti Summit to obtain a show of support from the other EU countries for price hikes for electricity and for covering up the wretched state that democracy is in, so that the Finnish Parliament is compelled, on the government's suggestion, to ratify a constitution that perished in referenda held by other EU countries."
"All the European federalists are enthusing about it, but that is not democracy."
"The EU elite may be speaking with one voice today but they are not listening to the people."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Prime Minister Vanhanen and President Barroso for their presentation here this morning."
"I should only like to say two things, which I already mentioned to the Prime Minister but perhaps President Barroso could take them on board as well."
"The majority in this Parliament agrees with and supports the need for the European Institute of Technology, but what arrangements are there to make it happen?"
"We can speak about it again and again, but there must be positive action to get it up and running, to give a core element to innovation and research in Europe."
"Secondly, with regard to the whole patents area, there must be protection of the ideas and creations that come from that innovative strategy and policy."
"Otherwise, all research money, all researchers, all the top graduates at doctorate level will move to the US, Japan or elsewhere, because that is where their ideas can be protected and there is bigger investment."
"To my mind, those are the two key issues with regard to achieving the Lisbon Strategy for the future."
"I congratulate Prime Minister Vanhanen."
"When everybody said that you could not get a united voice from Europe to speak to Russia, you achieved that."
"Congratulations."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, it is rather difficult for me to know where to begin on this."
"Energy is the lifeblood of any nation state and, of course, I am sent here to represent a nation state."
"I think it is very difficult for the people of the United Kingdom to accept that their energy policy should be decided basically by foreigners."
"It is within living memory that we have had to fight the battle of the Atlantic and we have had to live on a knife-edge for freedom because continental countries seem to find it impossible to live together."
"The thought, the idea or the concept that United Kingdom energy could possibly be controlled by some sort of arrangement with a gangster like Putin is absolutely ludicrous!"
"It is absolute madness to expect anything from a piece of paper signed by Putin, any more than we would from one signed by Adolf Hitler."
"The man is a gangster."
"If you are expecting the people of the United Kingdom to make any sort of arrangement for their lifeblood, the very lifeblood of the nation state, and to base it on people who have no fundamental interest in the wellbeing of the United Kingdom, I can tell you that it will not happen."
"We also have to start speaking the truth."
"There seems to be some sort of abstract concept here of renewable energy."
"It is a scientific fact that most of our renewable energy technology does not work."
"Wind farms are absurd."
"Any scientist independently retained will tell you that it is complete and total nonsense to expect the United Kingdom to produce the sort of energy levels that the European Union seems to require - which is 20% from a renewable source - by means of wind farms."
"We have to start telling people the truth."
"We do not yet have the technology for renewable energy."
"Let us be honest about it, but then honesty, of course, is something that we avoid in this Chamber!"
"(PL) Mr President, I shall begin by thanking President Borrell for making it clear to President Putin at Lahti that the European Union will not trade human rights for energy."
"This significant statement was also made on my behalf, and I feel it was also made in the name of all Polish MEPs, and indeed of all MEPs from the new Member States."
"President Borrell, along with the President of Poland and the Prime Ministers of Latvia, Denmark and Sweden, defended Europe's honour."
"We need to look our Russian partners in the eye when we speak of human rights."
"We cannot condone double standards, that is to say, we cannot insist on respect for human rights but only in the countries we do not happen to trade with. A united Europe is more than a question of economics and business."
"It is also a system of values that should be constantly uppermost in our minds, and not just when it suits us."
"As we conclude necessary and important business deals with Russia, we would do well to keep in mind the words of Lenin, the archetypal Russian politician, who said that 'the capitalists will sell us the rope with which to hang them'."
"Yesterday, some Polish journalists asked me if the Lahti Summit would mark a turning point in relations between the Union and Russia."
"I do not know."
"It might."
"To date, individual Member States of the Union have preferred to deal with Moscow over the heads of the others."
"Mr Schroeder hugged Mr Putin, Mr and Mrs Blair had a lovely time with Mr and Mrs Putin, Mr Berlusconi sang the praises of the Russian leader, and President Chirac became misty-eyed as he spoke of the President of the Russian Federation."
"Enough is enough."
"The European Union must unite."
"Mr President, let me first of all, as chairman of this Parliament's Russia delegation, express my appreciation of the fact that the Finnish Presidency devoted so much attention to our partnership with Russia."
"This partnership could be in both our interests."
"As the Prime Minister stated, we could be mutually supportive in achieving good diplomacy in the Middle East."
"If we shared principles of democracy, that would be the best guarantee of stability in our bilateral relationship."
"Furthermore, economically and in terms of energy, we both need each other."
"This partnership can only work if it is based on shared principles, balance and a basic trust."
"I want to make a few remarks on these matters following the informal summit."
"It must be made very clear that the boycott of Georgia and the treatment of Georgian people in Russia are unacceptable."
"This forms part of a pattern of interference by Russia that was also seen in Belarus and Ukraine."
"It must be clear that European principles mean that our common neighbours have their own sovereignty in deciding where their future lies."
"Secondly, the killing of Anna Politkovskaya is the latest incident in a long line of at least 19 journalists who have disappeared or been killed since Putin became President."
"I welcome the declaration by the Duma and the remarks by Putin, but the only thing that will really convince us is if the killers are tried and brought to justice."
"Further, the Duma and the President would be even more convincing if they agreed to measures to increase reduced press freedom."
"Thirdly, the question of economic cooperation was raised, a subject often discussed."
"Here, there must be reciprocity."
"We cannot have a situation where Russia wants to invest in our gas and oil infrastructure and even wants to buy a minority stake in Airbus, but where at the same time our companies like Shell and Mobil are kicked out of the energy fields in Russia."
"I say this because I think that Europe needs to unite on these principles."
"Europe showed strength for the first time in Finland."
"Putin was put on the defensive because of a united Europe."
"Let this be an encouragement to unite much more in the future, because this is the only way in which this partnership will be a balanced one that is in the interests of both partners."
"In conclusion, if we think, like Mr Schulz, that innovation is not going far enough, then we should support the President of the Commission, because he is trying, and we should put pressure on our national leadership to support the Commission in achieving real results."
"Lastly, I compliment Mr Blair and Mr Balkenende for their initiative on climate change."
"It deserves our full support."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I think that the Lahti summit represents an important step forward."
"I hope that the spirit of Lahti that you invoked will - as Mr Schulz said - also bring real, concrete results."
"Mr Barroso, you have made a foreign policy proposal in the field of energy policy that I very much welcome - you have my full support."
"I would just ask you to stand firm when certain countries once again shy away when they realise that perhaps they do not want these common energy and foreign policies after all."
"I would also ask Mr Vanhanen to say the same thing to the members of his Council. The decisions that have been taken here - and I have heard some very positive reports of the discussions in Lahti - now need to be implemented."
"It is the only way that we will be able to defend our interests."
"Dependency on Russia has been mentioned, but we really should bear in mind that Russia is also dependent on the European Union, on its consumption of crude oil and natural gas, precisely because the pipelines almost all lead solely to the European Union."
"We should therefore go into these negotiations and discussions with pride and self-confidence, and not be afraid to bring up certain subjects."
"Particularly in this area, we should establish an interdependence, including, of course, those regions that you mentioned, Mr Barroso, and which we should not forget, such as Ukraine and other countries in the Black Sea region, particularly Turkey."
"We must draw up a joint policy with them, too."
"Then we will be able to establish a true partnership with Russia."
"With regard to the disputes, we must not forget that, in our relations with Russia, particularly in the future partnership agreement, we also need a clear dispute resolution procedure."
"Conflicts may arise at any time, and we will not always be able to avoid them in future, so we must have a dispute resolution procedure like in the World Trade Organisation, so that we can ultimately resolve these matters mutually or through an independent mediator."
"Our goal is partnership."
"As Mr Schultz has already said, it is quite clear that Mr Putin is a strong man."
"Many Russians see that as a positive thing, but when the European Union is united it is stronger than Mr Putin."
"Then we will really be able to achieve a good, appropriate and equal partnership."
"(Applause)"
"- (NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Finland is presiding over the European Union at a particularly difficult juncture, since Heads of State or Government are very much at odds with each other about the European Union's future."
"What is worse, some of them do not even know in what direction they want to take it."
"A prestigious guest, such as President Bush, or more recently, President Putin, may well, then, prove to be the answer."
"Given its past, though, Finland is probably the best placed Member State to enter into open and in-depth dialogue with Russia."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the President on how he has guided the informal summit and also on the unanimity he managed to generate, both in terms of energy policy and in terms of Russia."
"I have to get one thing off my chest, though: 25 plus 2 Heads of Government and State all crowded together around the leader of one superpower!"
"It is my dearest wish for the EU's Heads of Government and State to finally get the European Union to grow up."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to pay tribute to Prime Ministers Blair and Balkenende, because they are taking Europe forward on climate change, and explicitly in this letter they did not mention nuclear."
"Nuclear is only 6% of our energy and it will divide Europe more than it will bring us together to speak with one voice."
"Mr Barroso, I think you now have the historic responsibility to come up with a comprehensive energy review in January."
"In this energy review we need a CO2 target for Europe for 2020."
"If we do not have a CO2 target for Europe we will not have investment security for our industry; and what is better regulation about, if it is not about bringing energy and climate policy together in the document you bring forward?"
"The second priority of this energy review must be putting an end to the oligopolistic structure in our energy and transport sectors."
"European business, European citizens, are losing billions of euros because of the lack of competition, and these same companies are preventing the innovation boost which we could have in these sectors."
"And as long as these oligopolies are not dismantled, we need specific policies in sectoral renewables and so on. Such a strategy is the ground for a foreign energy policy and this is a peace project for the world, because these technologies will diminish pressure on resources and it is a business opportunity for Europe."
"(PT) The increasing dismissal by the European institutions of the social impact of the acceleration of neoliberalism is alarming. Not only does this phenomenon keep the rates of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion high, it also increases unstable, poorly paid work."
"What is more, attempts are being made to bring back 'flexicurity', which obliges workers to relinquish their fundamental rights and to accept increasingly unstable work."
"The measures being implemented and others being put forward, such as the liberalisation and deregulation of services and the dismantling of public services, are trampling the concept of the European social model underfoot, and we are vehemently opposed to this."
"There have been increasing protests against these policies, as evidenced by the huge demonstration in Lisbon on 12 October organised by the CGTP (General Confederation of Portuguese Workers). Some 100 000 workers took part, making it the biggest demonstration since the 1980s."
"Do you not think that the time has come to take on board their justified grievances?"
"(PL) Mr President, it is widely known that the Lahti Summit did not end with a breakthrough."
"Neither was any significant progress made in talks with Russia concerning cooperation on energy policy."
"What is even more regrettable is that, despite statements to the contrary, the European Union did not present itself as a single power that Russia would have to take very seriously."
"In this context, the stance adopted by certain countries, including Poland, should be commended."
"The same is true of the approach adopted by the President of the European Parliament, Mr Borrell, thanks to whom the voice of the new Member States - Russia's neighbours - was heard at Lahti."
"All this has also been interpreted as a call for unity on energy policy within the European Union."
"It is only by adopting a tough and determined stance towards Russia that we can hope for success in the negotiations on Europe's energy security."
"Sadly, not all Member States have understood this yet."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard many lofty words of pathos in defence of human rights, even from the ranks of those parties which for decades remained silent while in the East there were popular uprisings in Berlin, in Budapest, and so on. At that time, Europe remained silent and those parties remained silent, whereas now they are all supporters of human rights, and are putting Vladimir Putin's Russia in the dock."
"If it is true that human rights must not be traded for economic interests, and I am completely convinced that it is, it is equally true that our focus and our determined defence of the values on which Europe is founded and which are today frequently infringed in Russia, but not only there - incidentally, I would like to hear the same pathos in speeches on infringements of human rights in Turkey, for example, a country which some would like to welcome enthusiastically, even immediately, into the European Union - must not close our eyes to a necessity."
"It is clear that as much as Russia needs us for energy collaboration, we need an economic partnership agreement with Russia."
"I would like to point out that Mr Putin himself has stated that he does not reject the principles of the Charter, but asks that another document be drafted, taking these principles and amending them in part."
"This is therefore a clear opening."
"The question of the agreement with Russia is highlighted by geo-economic and geo-strategic issues."
"Such is the agreement before us, and it regards the economic future of our region."
"A sense of realism is therefore needed, without, of course, abandoning the protection of human rights, which nonetheless represent a means of applying pressure in this instance also, given that Mr Putin's policy is turning towards an economic nationalism that is worrying for Europe, closing itself to collaboration and cutting contracts with Western companies."
"This is a realist policy that we need to support strongly and with a great sense of responsibility."
"Mr President, listening to Mr Bloom from the United Kingdom Independence Party earlier, I was somewhat surprised, as I thought dinosaurs had died out millions of years ago."
"I should like to focus my thoughts on the central issue at the Lahti summit: the issue of energy security in Europe and our continuing relationship with Russia."
"The recent dispute between Ukraine and Russia on gas supplies gave us all cause for concern."
"Let us be in no doubt that the relationship between the EU and Russia is of vital significance and ways must be found to strengthen it."
"We will need Russia's energy resources in the decades ahead and Russia, by the same token, will need access to EU markets if it is to develop its economic potential."
"The stakes on both sides are too high for diplomatic grandstanding."
"I was pleased to note that President Putin has said he wants to build a relationship based on common values."
"Those values must include an unshakeable commitment by Russia to pluralism and democratic process."
"If that great nation is to be embraced as a strategic partner in the years ahead, then we in Europe need to be assured that it will pursue the same kind of values and standards on democracy and human rights as we do."
"At this time perhaps we should take Mr Putin at his word and encourage him to ensure that democracy flourishes in Russia."
"However, there are some who believe the democratic process in Russia has actually stalled recently."
"I hope that more movement will take place in the right direction."
"I congratulate President Barroso on saying that the relationship with Russia requires transparency, the rule of law and reciprocity."
"I hope Mr Putin was listening."
"I was a little disappointed on human rights issues."
"I was disappointed that my own British Prime Minister, who had claimed that he was to raise those matters with Mr Putin, seems to have failed to do so."
"He must now find a suitable moment to do that."
"There is nothing to fear from frank debate on those issues."
"It is very necessary for a productive relationship in the future between Europe and Russia."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, informal summits lead only to speculative conclusions."
"This is the world of the imaginary, of dreams."
"Let us imagine for a moment that the dream comes true."
"Europe is an economic giant."
"Even excluding trade between the 25 Member States, we are the world's leading exporter."
"Europe is the leading destination for direct international investments."
"Not counting mergers and acquisitions, for 2005, the company IBM registered 8 000 investments in new production capabilities worldwide, including 900 in China, 600 in India, 1 200 in the United States and 3 200 in the Union, which thus takes 40% of world production investments."
"Yes, Europe has lost market shares, but less than the United States or Japan."
"Yes, China has become our top supplier, but Europe has doubled the volume of its exports to China."
"In fact, 60% of Chinese exports in 2005 were carried out by foreign companies operating in China."
"The Triad countries sell the goods that they produce in China to themselves, for the greater benefit of our consumers and the shareholders of multinational companies."
"Yes, our unemployment rates are too high, even though we are creating new jobs."
"The lowest salaries can be found in sectors such as catering, caretaking and cleaning companies, small businesses and craft industries, which are not subject to global competition."
"Of course, Europe could do better, if only the dwarfs who govern us would implement their own decisions and invest in innovation, research and trans-European networks."
"What we need is a real Union budget that would allow us to support the swift integration of the new members and so create an internal market in which we all experience more growth."
"Furthermore, if the leaders would honour their own signatures, we would perhaps arrive at a new energy treaty for Europe."
"Finally, if the summits were to stop taking speculative decisions, President Barroso could put in place a European Institute of Technology provided with real funding."
"Mr Vanhanen, must all this remain but a dream?"
"Mr President, I welcome the European Union's united negotiations and discussions with Russia on human rights, the rule of law, the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and other journalists in Russia and, of course, on energy."
"There is an old Russian saying that says 'love your neighbour but put up a fence'."
"The current energy negotiations with Russia have to be based on reciprocity, the rule of law and transparency."
"However, what is happening now in Russia in the field of energy is the very opposite of this and we need to take note of it."
"This also proves the absolute necessity of a common European energy policy, not only on security of supply but also for fighting global warming."
"Very soon we will be negotiating the emissions-trading system with Russia, which has signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol."
"That will be the true test both of European Union unity and what Russia ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, it may be difficult to combine European energy security with our fundamental European values, but are we willing to fail because of that?"
"In Russia, contract killings are as much a part of life as the suppression of non-governmental organisations and the restriction of fundamental democratic rights."
"The Yukos case, the detention of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, and the war in Chechnya are still, with regard to energy policy and human rights, current examples of the despotism of Mr Putin's Government."
"The murder of Anna Politkovskaya once again made it tragically clear that, when it comes to crimes against critical journalists, Russia is second only to Colombia."
"Russia is currently standing at a crossroads between small steps towards democracy and authoritarian structures."
"Criticism alone is no longer enough: energy policy and human rights must be negotiated jointly, and must not be played off against each other."
"According to Mr Putin, there can be no reliable guarantees in energy security."
"Despite that, we must ensure reliable guarantees for our European system of values."
"(EL) Mr President, I shall comment on two issues debated during the informal summit in Lahti."
"The first has to do with innovation policy which, in your opinion Mr Vanhanen, will be the source of European development."
"However, I do not think that we have the same innovation policy in mind, given that you are talking about abolishing the obstacles to cross-border economic activity and removing the factors that distort competition."
"Perhaps, however, we should focus on a more social development model?"
"Moreover, as you can see, the opinion of European citizens about the Union is at an all time low."
"Perhaps it is time to think about a more viable strategy for restoring confidence?"
"The second issue concerns Cyprus."
"Just one question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: did you discuss the possibility of Turkey's continuing not to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and keeping its ports and airports closed in December?"
". - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Lahti summit was an indicator of the unity of Europe's policies."
"If we can now manage to speak with one voice on energy, that is a step along the path to speaking with a united voice on all foreign policy issues."
"Secondly, another indicator is whether and how we can influence Russia's policies."
"When talking to the European Union about energy, Russia knows very well how to exploit our fears, while for our part we forget that Russia has an interest with regard to us - selling its energy profitably, easing the visa system, and making use of all that European civilisation provides, if we can put it in this way."
"This point should be used effectively, in order to achieve progress in the spheres of freedom of the press, democracy, human rights and investment equality."
"Thirdly, there is innovation policy."
"Currently, the potential of the new Member States is not being fully exploited."
"It is precisely in a new Member State that the European Institute of Technology should be set up."
"Riga in Latvia, as the Baltic States' centre of technology and environmental protection, is the most appropriate location for the institute. Thank you."
"(EL) Mr President, I think that we are still moving in the wrong direction."
"Why are we picking on Russia?"
"This last conference was also a war on Russia."
"That is what all the headlines are saying."
"America wants to play its little game and getting us to fire the shots."
"However, we are pushing Russia into creating a Sino-Russian axis, which will sandwich us between America, Russia and China."
"Why?"
"What quarrel do we have with them?"
"Are we going to repeat the historic mistakes we made 200 years ago?"
"So why pick on Russia?"
"What do we have to divide?"
"As for the human rights I have been hearing about, let us not delude ourselves."
"We turned a blind eye to the issue of Chechnya because we wanted Russia to turn an equally blind eye to Israel and Palestine."
"That is tit for tat."
"Can we therefore formulate a new policy for cutting our American apron strings?"
"I heard someone talking about the dwarves that rule Europe."
"Even the dwarves should pull themselves up to their full height at long last."
"We cannot be led by the Americans down a path which will only cause Europe problems."
"We need to understand that."
"(NL) Mr President, the informal Lahti summit has once again exposed the limitations of the European Union in a painful manner."
"It failed to persuade President Putin to sign the energy agreement that should make better access to Russia's gas and oil fields possible."
"EU enterprises investing in Russia still face major legal uncertainty, particularly in the areas of compliance and enforceability of contracts."
"President Putin came to Lahti in the knowledge that the European Union would be unable to speak with one voice about the human rights situation in Russia and about Russia's attitude to Georgia, for example."
"The lack of political unanimity is apparently as structural as is our dependence on Russian energy sources."
"I cannot imagine that the negotiation process with Turkey was not a talking point at the informal summit, given Turkey's refusal to comply with the current criteria and given a general worsening of relations with it, even though one third of its population is still in favour of EU accession."
"I should like the Council to tell us to what extent the Member States are prepared to accept sham solutions, such as placing Cypriot sea ports under UN control."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise what the public has remembered of this informal summit at Lahti: the visit by the Russian President at a time when relations between Europe and Russia are particularly tense, on the subjects both of the energy strategy and of human rights, following the assassination of Russian journalists in the last few days."
"I welcome the fact that Europe has had the courage to speak frankly about its questions on freedom of expression in Moscow, even if it confined itself to more diplomatic remarks in front of the cameras."
"European integration is founded on the rule of law and respect for democratic values."
"We have a duty to promote these principles, both at home and among our partners."
"This does not mean, contrary to what the Russian President implied, that Europe believes itself to be perfect."
"Of course, we have our faults, but we also have a duty to express clearly our concern and our disapproval regarding worrying abuses."
"Europe is not simply an economic Community."
"On the issue of energy, the Russian President has clearly stated that he does not reject the principles of the Energy Charter and that he would welcome a document that took up those principles while amending some of its provisions."
"In my opinion, this will be the overriding issue of the European Union-Russia Strategic Partnership to be negotiated shortly, as well as of the European Energy Summit proposed for next year by President Chirac."
"Finally, regarding immigration, the various positions are still too far apart for us to achieve a swift definition of the common policy that we need so much."
"The Member States appear decidedly less hurried than Europeans are to take this issue forward in order to give consistency to the different national policies operating within the Schengen area, in particular in relation to illegal immigration."
"In December, the Finnish Presidency must draw practical conclusions on the issues that have been raised at this informal summit."
"However, without the political will of the Member States, a presidency is reduced to impotence even when armed with goodwill, such as that currently being demonstrated by Finland."
"(FI) Mr President, the extraordinary summit meeting held in Lahti should be considered a success."
"The EU had a joint message for the Russian President on energy policy, democracy and human rights."
"The discussion must, however, be seen as only the start."
"Just as the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament Group, Martin Schulz, said, we now need concrete action."
"Whether speech is translated into deeds will be seen in the very near future, when we begin to negotiate the actual details of the EU-Russia agreement."
"It was important at the Lahti meeting to have spoken with Russia and not just about Russia."
"It was good that the discussions on energy also included consideration of the future."
"Although it may seem that the most important thing in the short term is the availability of energy, it was good that attention was paid to the future."
"Fortunately, it was left over from the session on innovation on the Lahti agenda."
"Our challenges in the area of energy policy and the answer to the problems of the future lie with innovation and with how we can start to exploit renewable energy sources and develop technology to save energy to a substantial degree."
"We have to get to a stage where over the long term carbon dioxide emissions will be cut by 60-80%, and this can only happen if we have a genuine common will as Europeans to invest in renewable sources of energy and energy savings."
"Furthermore, a social Europe was on the agenda at Lahti, not on the agenda of the summit itself, but on that of a separate labour market meeting."
"Employment and improved levels of employment are a very important component of the competitiveness of the European Union, and should therefore be clearly visible at all meetings."
"(FI) Mr President, just before the informal EU summit Finland was criticised for having invited President Putin to the meeting."
"His invitation was right, because one of the topics of the meeting was relations between the Union and Russia."
"Mr Putin was a guest at Lahti, though not an honorary guest."
"Whilst courteous, the Finns did not succumb to window-dressing, and instead raised the issues of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, human rights in Russia, and the unsatisfactory state of democracy in the country."
"Some suspected beforehand that these matters would not be mentioned."
"The EU-Russian dialogue is important."
"Finland took and is taking responsibility for sustaining it."
"Mutual dependence is a good thing for Russia and the EU, as long as it is exercised in the right way."
"Europe needs Russian markets, because Russia is close by and is a rapidly growing economy; but Russia also needs the EU."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the informal Council summit signals the strength of international competition with the single strategy of the European Union and of the antagonism between Member States vying to control the sources and means of conveyance of energy and new hardships for the peoples."
"The Council guidelines include actions on all three levels - economic, political and military - designed to allow the Euro-unifying monopolies to secure a strategic agreement with Russia and acquire a larger share of the spoils from exploiting natural resources in third countries."
"On the basis of the doctrine of energy security, the European Investment Bank is being called upon to step up its blackmail of third countries so that they bow down to the onerous terms laid down by the monopolies in order to control energy sources."
"Mr Solana announced that in the next 20 years 200 new nuclear power stations will be built, thereby setting the objective both of the European Union leading the way in the sale and exploitation of these stations and the maintenance of the oligopoly of enriched uranium, thereby revealing the true causes of the aggression of the imperialists in order to control ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
". - (LV) The Finnish Presidency's aspirations to maintain continuity, by continuing discussions on the issues mooted last year by the British Presidency, are to be welcomed."
"These subjects are worthy of serious debate."
"This is particularly true because in the space of a year little has been achieved in these spheres."
"The guest invited to the event - the President of Russia - is proof of how serious the Presidency is about security of energy supply."
"The idea is to be welcomed in every respect, since it gave Heads of Government the opportunity not only to listen to the opinion of Russia's leader on the chances of ratification of the Energy Charter and about the risk to Europe's investments in the energy sector in Russia, but also Russia's policy of pressure on Georgia and its understanding in the sphere of human rights."
"It was a useful prelude to the summit between the European Union and Russia scheduled for next month."
"We may allow ourselves to hope that this meeting has increased understanding among the European Union Member States that the most effective way of making Russia into a partner with an interest in Europe is to approach it as a united cartel of energy consumers."
"Russia's current and future economy is built on the export of energy resources."
"There is no doubt that the achievements of the Presidency and the Commission should be evaluated in terms of their ability to achieve partnership among the Member States and unity in the Union's foreign policy. Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, I am pleased that attention was paid in Lahti to the problem of immigration, but I regret that other issues were treated as more of a priority."
"When the Finnish Presidency presented its programme in July, I called in this House for illegal immigration to be treated as a priority issue."
"There has been little cause for optimism since then."
"On the ground, what is taking place on the shores of the Canary Islands is very serious."
"The Frontex system and solidarity amongst European partners in general have not been up to the task, but perhaps unilateral regularisations did not create the best possible climate for persuading the partners to cooperate."
"Illegal immigration is a problem for all of us in an area without internal borders, such as the Schengen area."
"At European level this area is essentially dealt with by means of taking decisions and implementing them."
"Ideas and plans have largely been established, for example in the conclusions of the European Councils of Seville, in 2002, and of Thessaloniki and of Brussels, in 2003."
"Those conclusions enshrine the principle that immigration should be integrated into the European Union's external action and that cooperation is needed with third countries in the field of illegal immigration."
"There is also a mechanism for assessing the degree of cooperation of third countries and furthermore the assessment criteria are included."
"I believe, however, that this mechanism has been used little and in a very bureaucratic way."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to point out that decisions on illegal immigration no longer require unanimity in the Council, but that, during 2004 and 2005, this problem was relegated until the assaults on the fences in Ceuta and Melilla."
"The Union must not act in a reactive manner, in response to events, and then forget those issues that were previously priorities."
"We have been negotiating a re-admission agreement with Morocco for five years."
"Mr President, it is not acceptable that we should only take terrorism seriously following 11 September 2001, the energy crisis only following the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, and illegal immigration, only after the deaths at the fences of Ceuta and Melilla."
"The European Union will be judged by its results."
"I hope that there will be results in the remaining months of the Finnish Presidency and also at the European Council in December, and naturally that the progress made at previous European Councils be taken into account."
"(FR) Mr President, the subject of immigration should in fact have been discussed more widely at Lahti."
"I believe that this was requested by all the countries situated on Europe's borders, and in particular by the countries of the South."
"We are very concerned, because it is evident that the Member States are still dragging their feet with regard to drawing up a genuine common policy in the field of immigration."
"What is more, some people want to approach the issue of immigration solely from the point of view of cracking down on it."
"However, in my view, the urgency is first and foremost humanitarian."
"We must combat the exploitation of immigrants by networks seeking to lower labour costs and bypass labour laws and rules on social protection."
"In the European Parliament yesterday we had an enlightening hearing enabling us to observe that, on European soil, immigrants are considered as slaves."
"They are largely underpaid, forced to work extremely long hours and housed in terrible conditions."
"They are ill-treated."
"Some have suffered physical assaults."
"It is because it was confronted with these unacceptable living conditions and people without rights that Spain decided to regularise en masse all those working in its territory, and I pay tribute here to the immense courage shown by that country."
"Mass regularisation is not, and must not be, a solution."
"In this case, however, to act otherwise was impossible."
"It had to be done."
"We must all now be vigilant in our countries in order to ensure that all working immigrants have rights and are considered in the same way as all other workers."
"That is what the credibility of the Union and its values requires of us."
"If we really want to be effective in the field of immigration, the Member States must finally agree to work together in order to put in place a genuine policy on legal immigration and, above all, a genuine co-development policy, as close to the people as possible. Member States must also take great care not to enrich dictators or fuel corruption."
"(SV) President Vladimir Putin, we are concerned about developments in Russia, and your comments about Georgia at the summit do nothing to alleviate that concern."
"Many of us in the EU want to see a successful Russia: an extension to a world based on democracy and justice."
"We want you to help those of us who wish you Russians well, but you are not doing so."
"We must hold out the prospect of a common free-trade area and we must work towards freedom of movement."
"How, President Putin, are we to do this, however, when you are giving a show of strength to a small country like Georgia?"
"How are we to do this when you have not approved the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia?"
"How are we to do this when you belittle the work done by Anna Politkovskaya?"
"Our cooperation must be based on common values and ground rules but, following the summit, it now unfortunately feels as if we are further away from each other than we were before."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Lahti, an important step was taken in energy policy, but in my view it was not a milestone."
"It would perhaps be wiser for us in European politics not always to bandy about grand speeches and then disappoint the people when we do not get results."
"I find Mr Barroso's proposal to undertake realistic projects and implement them bit by bit much more intelligent."
"There has been an important development in energy policy on the subject of security of supply."
"First of all, the subject of security of supply has come to the forefront of energy policy, and has, I hope, perhaps helped us here in Parliament to stop discussing energy policy only from the point of view of climate policy."
"Security of supply is a high priority."
"At least since the developments in Ukraine - since it became clear that Russia and President Putin are using energy policy as a political tool - we are all surely a bit more prepared, as was evident in Lahti to a certain extent, to take this issue more seriously."
"This is not just talk - there has clearly been a change in Russia."
"Anyone who takes Mr Putin seriously - and we must do so - must address these positions."
"There is also the fact that we are taken more seriously when we act together."
"To that extent, Lahti was a success, because we spoke with one voice."
"The next step would be for us to push harder for Europe to be given competences in the field of energy policy."
"Thirdly, we must be more consistent in the specific actions we undertake."
"Security of supply has a foreign policy aspect, but also involves strengthening the industries involved in it."
"We must examine more closely whether our rules, regulations and inspections are really ensuring security of supply, or actually producing uncertainty."
"Those who negotiate for us, those who buy energy out in the real world, need to invest, and businesses only invest when there is a reasonable degree of certainty."
"Last but not least, security of supply also requires a variety of energy sources."
"It would be idiocy to rule out nuclear power: it would do security of supply a serious disservice."
"(HU) The Lahti Summit was a great success, proving that the real strength of the Union lies in its unity."
"Without the Lahti Summit, the Russian president would not have used a more accommodating tone towards some Member States."
"I congratulate our Finnish colleagues; many countries could learn from Finnish diplomacy, which has always been able to continue the dialogue with Russia even during the most difficult times."
"Obviously, there exists a mutual but asymmetrical interdependence in energy supply between the EU and Russia."
"We in the EU, as importing states, are more dependent, but Russia's dependence must also be considered."
"Our aim is to reduce this dependence on Russian energy sources, but for most Member States - Hungary amongst them - there is no viable medium-term alternative."
"As far as renewable energy sources are concerned, Mr Barroso, the European Commission has no viable concept of any kind."
"We criticise Russia on the rule of law, and rightly so."
"But can we speak of the rule of law, Mr Barroso, if there is no legal security within the European Commission?"
"When, in the middle of the maize harvest, the Union changes the rules of intervention for maize?"
"This is no rule of law nor legal security."
"We rightfully criticise Russia, but we too have to observe the rule of law."
"My congratulations on the summit, and I ask Mr Barroso to take steps, because otherwise Hungary will call on the European Court of Justice, as this is no rule of law nor legal security."
"Let us set a good example for Mr Putin and the Russian democrats!"
"- (LT) I am very glad to see that the Lahti Summit has at last induced Europe to pool its efforts, demonstrate solidarity, and take a firm stand in the dialogue with Russia on energy and democracy."
"We see at last something tangible being done about the words that the energy sector is an integral part of foreign policy."
"In the discussion of the issues of safety and transparency in the energy sector, what happened on the Druzhba oil pipeline, when Russia stopped the supply of oil, took on more the character of a political accident than a technical one."
"Moscow expressed its discontent over the fact that the Lithuanian company Mažeikių Nafta was sold to the Polish company PKN Orlen and not to a Russian enterprise."
"That Europe should have so clearly expressed its position, during the Summit with Russia, that rules must be obeyed in the energy sector, is a huge achievement."
"I cannot conceal my admiration for the changed positions of Finland, France and especially Germany."
"I hope this brings Schroeder's politics to an end."
"The current position of such decision makers as our Commission President, Mr Barroso and Mrs Merkel offers the hope of a united Europe with a common energy policy and a common future."
"(PL) Mr President, media accounts of the Lahti Summit have been dominated by what Prime Minister Vanhanen described as a frank conversation with the President of Russia."
"I, however, would like to focus on another important subject discussed at the summit, namely innovation and technological progress."
"I fully endorse President Barroso's opinion that the more the Union focuses on practical tasks and on actions close to the citizens, the more it will be respected and appreciated by them."
"Mr Barroso's promotion of a European Institute for Technology is an example of just such an action, that is to say, a specific venture which is bound to generate a positive response from European citizens."
"It was perhaps unintentional but, in a sense, highly symbolic that the planned Institute was agreed in Finland, which is the most innovative country in our Community."
"It is also very important, however, to involve the new Member States of the European Union in the process of developing cutting-edge technologies."
"The current level of investment in innovation in the aforementioned countries is far too low."
"The structure of the European Institute for Technology proposed by the Commission, namely a central core plus a network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities spread across the whole of Europe, will enable academic institutions in Central and Eastern Europe to be involved in the Institute's activities."
"The European Institute for Technology's budget and sources of funding are a key concern that goes hand in hand with any discussion concerning the plans for the Institute."
"In my country, Poland, I have noted a readiness to devote structural fund resources to setting up the Institute."
"The Polish authorities are thus demonstrating their desire to link regional development aims to contemporary challenges."
"These mainly involve investment in knowledge and developing an economy based on modern technologies."
"In cooperation with the regional and local authorities, the Polish Government is putting forward the city of Wrocław as the seat of the Governing Board of the new European Institute for Technology."
"The Polish authorities also propose that Wrocław should become one of the main scientific research centres."
"I firmly believe that the city is ideally suited to this purpose."
"Wrocław, and the surrounding region, can offer a vibrant and innovative academic environment, with over one hundred thousand gifted and ambitious young students and considerable new investment in industrial development."
"(EL) Mr President, today we are supposed to be debating the results of Lahti."
"What results?"
"On energy and relations with Russia, the prime ministers said that they will insist on respect for fundamental rights by Russia."
"They then 'unsaid' that, implying that 'realpolitik' is the only solution in order to satisfy the Union's energy requirements."
"In the end, they managed to get Russia to turn its back on them on both energy and humanitarian issues."
"The results were even more disappointing on the major issue of immigration."
"We need, the prime ministers told us, to focus on better guarding of the borders."
"Fine, but then why did we cut the Frontex budget?"
"More importantly, however, the more they insist on addressing immigration solely as a policing issue with repression, the more they will undermine our future."
"In order to address illegal immigration and inhumane trafficking in human beings, we need, first of all, a legal immigration framework."
"They bicker among themselves and refuse to adopt one."
"We need a serious foreign policy and economic development and conciliation policy which they are unable to formulate."
"We also need a bold policy for the integration and equal treatment of immigrants which they refuse to design."
"(DE) Mr President, it is quite true that we need a partnership with Russia, and it would be nice to have a community of values too, but what is the reality of the situation?"
"In Russia, the vertical of power is organised down to the last detail, the Duma has been domesticated, governors are appointed, not elected, freedom of the press is restricted, and the work of non-governmental organisations, including political foundations for democracy and human rights, is getting harder and harder."
"Therefore, we cannot currently have a community of values with the Russian Government - it might be possible with the Russian people, but they were not in Lahti."
"That, Mr Vanhanen, is why Mr Barroso is right when he says that we should agree on specific principles for stable relations: transparency, legal certainty, national treatment, and mutual opening up of and access to markets."
"On the basis of these principles, we can build a partnership and cooperation agreement, and also hope for and work towards the conclusion, one day, of a strategic partnership with Russia based on shared values."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, without a doubt the Lahti Summit was a success for the EU."
"Its focus on competitiveness and innovation was followed by a constructive dialogue with Russia and the issue of human rights was also raised."
"Our heads of state and government showed unity and reflected our common values."
"As the EPP Vice-President, Michel Barnier, said a couple of weeks ago in Lyon, none of us can sit at the table of global decision-making as a national politician."
"This really is true and also applies to EU-Russia relations."
"Freedom of speech is in great danger in Russia."
"In a very recent study by Reporters Without Frontiers - where many EU Member States held the top positions - Russia was placed 147th out of 168 countries."
"I rarely agree with the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell Fontelles, but I have to say that he was right to emphasise strongly the question of human rights and democracy in Russia with President Putin."
"We must have a clear stance on human rights, whoever we might be facing."
"An independent and efficient investigation to find and condemn the vicious murderers of the courageous journalist Anna Politkovskaya is a real test for freedom and the rule of law in Russia and for its relations with the EU."
"The democratic world simply cannot stay quiet when freedom is threatened and its strongest advocates are shot down."
"If we do not act now, we might lose another 30 years of freedom, as did our Hungarian citizens when the western world did not act bravely enough to support the people who rose up in revolution 50 years ago."
"Practical cooperation with Russia is important, but nothing is more important than the progress Russia makes on the path to freedom and human rights."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when speaking to China about trade issues, to the United States about agriculture or to Russia about energy, or when intervening in crisis situations such as Lebanon or the Middle East in general, a common theme has been apparent for some time: no European country, on its own, has the ability to deliver, to stay the course and bring goals and ambitions to fruition."
"Therefore, the theme also holds true in relation to energy and the issue of our relationship with Russia, and a leadership causing increasing concern: Europe must be united and speak with one voice."
"If, as Mr Goebbels has said, the Lahti summit has produced only speculation, much now remains to be done, and for this we need an authoritative and bold Commission, capable of laying aside national self-interests and speaking on behalf of all, a Parliament capable of being the most authoritative exponent of Community interests, and a Council and governments which understand that interdependency among our countries is the key to increasing our negotiating power."
"There are signs and examples of this, from among which I would like to cite the decision made by the Italian Government, which, on hearing the news of its seat from January on the UN Security Council, said straight away that this seat will be used in the service of Europe."
"This is a practical action representing an example of a contribution from one member of the Council."
"(EL) Mr President, I wish to draw the House's attention, as regards Lahti, to the proposal for a European Institute of Technology (ΕΙΤ)."
"The first messages from the Council's side are positive, as they are from Parliament's side."
"What I wish to highlight, Mr Vanhanen and Mr Barroso, is that we need a new and innovative tool which successfully combines education, research and innovation."
"We need a steam engine which will enable us to transform research into innovative products and services."
"However, we do not need an institution which will uproot the long-standing university tradition in Europe; we need one which will respect and make maximum use of it."
"It is therefore, for this very reason, extremely important for us to know what our universities, research centres and undertakings believe before we take a decision on this new institute."
"Numerous agencies have already submitted their opinions."
"At first glance, it would appear that the messages we are receiving are often contradictory on certain important issues."
"However, I consider that the positions are not set in stone; rather they express concerns."
"That is why it is also very important for us to give all the partners a great deal of our time in order to consult willingly and in a spirit of cooperation."
"The initial approach in the proposal for a regulation leaves open numerous questions on crucial issues, such as how will we safeguard viable financing for the ΕΙΤ?"
"How will we persuade private individuals to invest in an unprecedented vehicle?"
"How will we safeguard the fundamental participation of universities and convince them that the ΕΙΤ will not clash with them or weaken their activities?"
"How will we convince them that research activities will not be fragmented, leading to the opposite of the result being sought?"
"We need to clarify all the details, because that is where the success of the endeavour will be judged; not in the general idea which is generally accepted."
"(ET) In his speech today, Mr Barroso said that the Georgian question had been touched on."
"We all know that a touch can be either a gentle caress or the hug of a bear."
"At the press conference in Lahti last Friday evening, we all found out, to our great surprise, that nothing is happening between Georgia and Russia, and that instead there is a conflict between Georgia on the one hand, and Abkhazia and Ossetia on the other."
"According to President Putin, the situation is nearing the point of bloodshed."
"Last month, however, Putin informed Western journalists that if Kosovo were to be separated from Serbia, Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria would definitely break away."
"Since these are not island states, separation would actually mean being incorporated into Russia."
"That is a serious revision of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement."
"Mr President, we know that the conflict between Russia and Georgia is not about a provocation on the part of Georgia, but rather a new awakening of Imperial Russia, which is based on the one hand on inciting Russian nationalism, and on the other hand on the use of energy supplies for the restoration of the empire."
"The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline is also not insignificant in this matter."
"I call upon all European Union institutions to defend Georgia with a stronger hand than ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) I note with dismay that the Lahti summit represents a wasted opportunity as regards the issue of energy, both in terms of the EU's relations with Russia and the common understanding between the Member States."
"Under pressure from the media, European politicians have made it clear that they appreciate the importance of speaking with one voice when it comes to energy."
"I fear, however, that we have yet to achieve any actual unity and harmony when it comes to promoting energy issues."
"This is evidenced by the fact that some EU Member States prefer to conduct bilateral negotiations on their energy security issues rather than on behalf of the EU as a whole."
"I must highlight the fact that the energy issue has environmental, economic and, above all, geostrategic implications."
"Europe is dependent on external energy sources."
"This inability to harmonise our interests and approach weakens our negotiating position in the global energy market, exacerbates our vulnerability and seriously weakens our authority as Europeans acting in a foreign policy context."
"Our ability to promote values such as democracy, the rule of law and market transparency around the world will be restricted."
"I should therefore like to call on the Council and the Commission to take practical steps to prepare and implement a European energy policy, which is a potential solution and which would prepare the ground for a common EU energy policy."
"Such a strategy would set out our goals in the area of energy, as well as the measures needed to achieve those goals, and would lay down a clear mechanism for joint decision-making on energy projects and for communication inside and outside the EU, strengthening our solidarity in energy issues."
"At stake here is our future in the globalised world and our ability to safeguard the continent's stability and prosperity."
"I firmly believe that the energy issue will be a key test of the EU's ability to act in an effective manner."
"(FR) Mr President, in Finland President Borrell has, to his credit, championed human rights."
"President Barroso has been sure to champion Europe's energy rights."
"That is his duty."
"As would any Head of State or Government, President Chirac has stuck up for his country's gas consumers."
"That is as I would expect."
"However, it pricks European consciences, which would have been pricked in the same way if oil from Saudi Arabia, Iran or some African country had been at issue."
"For me, the issue is not that of knowing whether gas can be purchased from the Devil."
"Purchased it will be."
"The issue is, rather, that of how gas from the Devil can be done without."
"I think that, over the next few years - and in your case, Mr Vanhanen, over the next few months - it is independence that must guide us."
"In the next 10 to 20 years, oil and gas must be to our independence what coal and steel were to our peace."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all, thank you for this debate, which has shown that Parliament also seems very united in its main policies and that it is fully in accord with European Council and Commission views."
"In this respect, I believe that it will be easier for the Union to find a basic approach in its foreign energy policy."
"It is actually worth remembering that we did not begin the debate on foreign energy relations at European Council level until March this year, at a summit dinner during the Austrian Presidency."
"At the time we reached the conclusion that the Union also needed a foreign energy policy."
"During the subsequent presidency, Finland assumed the task of shaping a foreign energy policy in collaboration with the Commission, and that is what we are doing."
"The Commission drafted an excellent paper for the Lahti Summit, and over lunch there we spent around three hours discussing the approach so thoroughly that President Barroso and I were able to speak for the group as a whole in the evening when we met President Putin."
"Over the months to come we also will be defining this foreign energy policy in terms of a Union approach, not just in respect of Russia, but all our partners and all third countries."
"Quite a number of speeches here pointed out that the Lahti Summit was a step or a first step in the right direction."
"That is how I also feel."
"I also sympathise with the comments that we must in practice show that we are also taking action."
"The next important stage will be in the next few weeks when the Council must reach agreement on the negotiations mandate, on the basis of which the Union is to commence talks with Russia on the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, or whatever name this new agreement should be given."
"At the EU-Russia Summit in November consensus will have to be reached and a decision taken on the commencement of talks."
"In this respect, the Lahti Summit was a practice run."
"The Lahti Summit, however, also let it be known to Mr Putin that at the meeting in November, at which President Barroso, High Representative Javier Solana and I will represent the Union, we will be speaking on behalf of the entire Union."
"This debate we have now had in Parliament will provide firm support for that."
"We might say that all the Union's institutions are in the front line on this."
"We are dependent on one another."
"This dependence must be made to benefit both parties through reciprocity."
"Dependence also needs to be based on common values, as has already been said so many times in the Chamber."
"This is a clear Union aim and policy."
"When we talk of cooperation with Russia, however, we should not make Russia or the Russians out to be monsters."
"They want cooperation, they want to improve their standard of living and prosperity, and they want to cooperate with us."
"This was also the strong message that President Putin was sending."
"He stressed that Russia and the Russians are in fact more dependent on Europe than Europe is on Russia."
"They particularly need cooperation in very many areas of technology to make progress in their own development work, and we must also be prepared for this."
"With regard to investment, I would like to remind everyone that European companies have already made investments in the Russian energy sector to the tune of many billions of euros."
"Some major investment projects are unfinished, some companies are having difficulties with the Russian administration, and some have seen their projects through to completion more smoothly."
"For that reason we need common rules to play by, rules which are the same for everyone."
"Similarly, the rules for Russian companies on Europe also need to be the same."
"I wish to thank you for this debate and the feedback."
"In December we will return to many of these subject areas, with some firm conclusions, and then we will also definitely be returning to the questions raised in several speeches here relating to immigration."
"On matters of immigration, whether it be legal or illegal immigration, we need solidarity amongst us and a common policy, and we will also definitely be returning to that."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that practically everything has already been said."
"Allow me simply to return to a number of points you raised during the debate."
"With regard, first of all, to the European Institute of Technology - and as Prime Minister Vanhanen pointed out - the European Council gave the green light - not the orange light, but the green light - to the initiative at the end of the Lahti summit."
"It now remains to implement it."
"That is why we have already presented a legislative proposal to be examined by the Council and Parliament and covering, for example, the issue of the financing that you mentioned during the debate."
"Our approach is that there must be financing not only by the Community institutions but also by the Member States that wish to support the initiative."
"It is a way for them to achieve the Lisbon objectives where innovation and research are concerned."
"We also await contributions from the private sector."
"On this subject, allow me to point out to you that, on the basis of our informal contacts, the private sector has a great interest in financing certain actions to be taken by the European Institute of Technology, a state of affairs that is, moreover, only to be expected since the same ideas are to be found in many of our Member States."
"Public-private partnerships do exist and, if initiatives on the part of the Member States manage to attract private investment for research, I wonder why we should not be capable of achieving the same at European level."
"I say that because we think it necessary to give a European dimension to support for research."
"Where this very subject of research is concerned, the United States manifestly differs from Europe due, in particular, to the existence of institutions or networks covering the whole of the territory of the United States of America, for example the National Science Foundation, familiar to a number of you, or the National Institute for Health."
"In Europe, we have until now had practically nothing along those lines."
"A number of our countries have major institutions in the form of great universities, but it is only now that we have set up the European Research Council, which is an institution crucial to implementing the Seventh Research Framework Programme, and the European Institute of Technology, which is an institution specifically founded on the idea of networks with a view to giving a European impetus and perspective to innovation, research and teaching focused on excellence."
"That is why it is a great project, and I would thank all those who have spoken in favour of it."
"We have asked for this Institute's main priorities to include the fight against climate change and a leading role for Europe in the area of renewable sources of energy that respect the environment."
"I believe that we have a specific mission in this regard, and I shall address my remarks more particularly to those, including Mr Turmes, who have expressed concerns about this matter."
"Energy is, without a doubt, the issue of the future, and not only from an economic, but also from a political, point of view."
"I agree with the comment by Mr Poignant, who draws a parallel with the situation in the coal and steel sector."
"I do think that, where energy is concerned, there is a serious argument in favour of a federal approach."
"That is, moreover, why, a few months ago, we presented a Green Paper on sustainable energy, and we were very pleased with the support given by the European Council to the idea of a common approach to energy matters."
"It is, therefore, precisely along those lines that we are working, Mr Poignant."
"That approach is very important if we consider our responsibilities to our planet and to future generations."
"Climate change is perhaps the greatest challenge of the 21st century."
"However, it is also very important from the economic point of view, so crucial is it for us still to be capable of being in the vanguard of the fight against climate change, providing it with its impetus."
"It is also very important as a demonstration of solidarity, especially with a view to the enlarged Europe."
"We have here an opportunity to show that solidarity needs to be real."
"I therefore think that we are concerned here with something very ambitious, and I can guarantee, in particular to Mr Turmes, that it is in this spirit that we are preparing the energy package to be presented in January."
"What is more, you have already seen an initial sign of what is to come in the form of the proposal on energy efficiency that we have just tabled."
"As Prime Minister Vanhanen has said, the Lahti Council has opened the way to the formal decisions on energy that we hope to obtain at the spring Council under the auspices of what will already be the German Presidency."
"I shall conclude by saying that I share the ambition, and sometimes even the impatience, expressed by Mr Goebbels, Mr Swoboda, Mr Schulz and many others."
"Our role now is, as Mr Goebbels said, to convert the dream into reality."
"Indeed it is."
"However, the informal summits offer an opportunity to deepen the debate and to consolidate positions, as shown moreover by the Hampton Court summit."
"From this point of view, I can honestly say to you that the Lahti Council signalled progress."
"It was difficult, particularly because of our ever more complex relations with Russia."
"Where that aspect too was concerned, I had the sense of progress being made, with Mr Putin's presence contributing to this."
"I had the feeling that the Heads of State or Government understood the need for coherence and solidarity."
"That is why I hope that now, with the vigilant support of the European Parliament, the conditions will be present, during the Finnish Presidency and beyond, to make progress in these very important areas of energy and innovation and also to make headway with our project of a more united Europe."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I knew that UKIP members are divorced from reality, but even then I am astonished at Godfrey Bloom's speech, in which he seemed to imply that Britain was self-sufficient on energy and did not need to work with, or even talk to, other countries."
"He says that Britain's 'lifeblood' should not be in the hands of 'foreigners', but how does he want to avoid us importing energy?"
"Certainly not by renewables, which he dismisses out of hand as 'nonsense' claiming that wind farms are 'absurd' and that 'no reputable scientist' would claim that renewable energy can play a significant part in Britain's energy mix."
"So, no imports, no renewables, North Sea oil and gas running out, nuclear, if kept, catering merely for a small proportion of electricity, and the possibilities for expanding coal being somewhat limited, the UKIP vision of Britain's future, untarnished by 'foreigners', is a dark one!"
"(PT) Against the backdrop of the summit, forces are gathering to discuss how to (re)start the process of (re)imposing the unacceptable Treaty that is inaccurately and insultingly referred to as the 'European Constitution', against the sovereign, democratically expressed wishes of the French and Dutch peoples."
"These nefarious plans have increasingly been coming from above."
"Take, for example, the words of Antonio Vitorino, strategist of the Portuguese Socialist Party, who, we hear, 'now works for the Commission'. He says that the Portuguese Presidency in the second half of 2007 will have 'the enormous responsibility' of 'taking the first steps towards implementing the [so-called] constitutional amendment programme' and 'this will be a launch pad for the new [so-called] European Constitution', thereby implementing a 'programme' previously defined by the German Presidency and to be concluded by the French Presidency in the second half of 2008."
"The headlong rush towards capitalist integration that characterises the EU and the neoliberal, federalist and militarist integration that the so-called 'European Constitution' would reinforce in the legal and political spheres will once again, in spite of all the propaganda, obfuscation and authoritarianism, have to contend with categorical rejection by all those who are fighting for a Europe of sovereign, equal States, a Europe of social progress, cooperation and peace."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a few remarks about the Lahti European summit."
"Firstly, at a time when our continent is subjected to an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration, the Heads of State or Government have not seen fit to devote more than half an hour to this problem."
"Nothing - absolutely nothing - is to be expected of the European Union in this area, and it is a matter of urgency to acknowledge formally that no immigration policy can be anything but national and no cooperation on the subject anything but intergovernmental."
"Secondly, Mr Putin is quite entitled to retain a degree of sovereignty over his country's energy resources and to refuse to sell them cut-price to hungry oil multinationals in the name of an economic liberalism to which he does not subscribe."
"As for the sabre-rattling about human rights, respect for which must form the basis for the EU's relations with the rest of the world, this would be more credible if it were not so selective and if it were also directed at countries such as China."
"Finally, we are still waiting for the Council to condemn the Turkish authorities, who have tried to force the removal of one of our Cypriot fellow Members from a delegation of MEPs."
"It is less and less acceptable to negotiate the accession of a country that refuses to recognise the full range of Member States."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12 noon in anticipation of the formal sitting and resumed at 12.05p.m.)"
"1."
"Peace process in Spain (vote)"
"We shall examine the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented an amendment to paragraph 2 of its motion for a resolution."
"(Parliament rejected the amendment by electronic vote)"
"We shall now vote on the motion for a resolution presented."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution by roll-call vote)"
"Next we shall examine the motion for a resolution by the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups."
"(IT) Mr President, in accordance with Rules 136 and 138 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to request an explanation regarding the fact that substantial amendments have been made, outside of the terms laid down by the Rules of Procedure, to the title and paragraph 6 of the resolution on which we are preparing to vote, a resolution of great political importance."
"In addition, I would like to point out that versions of the new text are not yet available in all languages, as laid down in the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, we would like to know why the services have accepted such an amendment without, I might add, obtaining the agreement of the political groups, and did not make use of an oral amendment, as provided for by established practice and the Rules of Procedure."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, it is not possible to vote on an amendment to the text that was tabled outside of the permitted time and without having consulted the political groups."
"The Secretariat informs me that a text is available for the honourable Members in all languages."
"They assure me of that."
"(PL) Mr President, may I enquire if there has been some misunderstanding?"
"According to our voting lists, the first vote was by show of hands."
"The second vote, on the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, was by roll call."
"According to our lists, however, this vote should have been on the Socialists' resolution and we voted against, in the belief that it was the second vote."
"Have I understood correctly that the vote that has taken place was the first vote?"
"I would like to point out that many of my Polish colleagues and also colleagues from the Czech Republic and other countries voted in the same way."
"Could the situation be clarified, please?"
"What the Presidency has put to the vote is very clear: we have put an amendment to the motion for a resolution to the vote."
"We were voting on the resolution presented by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"One would have to be completely deaf not to understand what we were putting to the vote."
"(Protests from the right)"
"(Applause from the left)"
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to stress two procedural issues."
"The first is that the amendment should have been voted on by a show of hands and not by roll-call vote."
"(Applause from the Group)"
"As we have just seen, Mr President, that error has led to confusion amongst some Members in terms of their voting intentions."
"I would therefore ask you to put this error right in application of our Rules of Procedure."
"The second procedural issue is that the text of the Socialist resolution has been subject to a substantial amendment - and I would stress, substantial - which has not conformed to the Rules of Procedure."
"It should have been done by means of a registered amendment, which was not done within the time limit laid down, or by means of an oral amendment in plenary."
"The text of the Socialist resolution does not therefore conform to the Rules of Procedure, Mr President, and I would ask that you act accordingly."
"(Applause from the right)"
"(Protests from the left)"
"Mr Vidal-Quadras, we have not taken a roll-call vote, but rather an electronic vote."
"You have been here long enough to know the difference."
"Secondly, interpreting the Rules of Procedure is not your responsibility, but rather that of the President, with the assistance of the Secretariat, and I am listening to all of the arguments expressed so that I can take them properly into consideration and then act in the most appropriate manner possible, but please do not pontificate."
"Do not say: this conforms to the Rules of Procedure and this does not, because that is not your role."
"(Protests of the right)"
"(Applause from the left)"
"(DE) Mr President, I think you have said all that needs to be said."
"The organisation of the agenda, particularly in terms of the order and conduct of votes, is the responsibility of the President."
"My impression is that you conducted the votes perfectly properly."
"However, my political experience has also taught me one thing - we are all politicians, and that includes you, ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: when no more progress can be made politically, then the agenda has to take the blame."
"We know that, but I would ask, Mr President, that we vote now."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, given your esteemed background as a Spanish Socialist, is it possible that you might have a conflict of interest in continuing in the Chair, just on this point?"
"(Loud and sustained applause from the right)"
"(ES) Mr President, given the confusion that certain speeches may have caused, I simply wished to clarify that no Socialist resolution is going to be voted on, but rather we are going to vote on a joint resolution by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/EFA and the GUE/NGL Group, that is to say, by several parliamentary groups jointly."
"No Socialist resolution is going to be put to the vote, Mr President."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, people may be trying to change the vote, or whatever, but I actually voted the wrong way because of the roll-call vote."
"That is the proof of the matter."
"There is at least one vote that was wrong there."
"(Applause from the right)"
"(PL) Mr President, it is surely essential for votes to reveal the wishes of this House, that is to say, the wishes of the Members of this Parliament."
"Due to a mistake, or an oversight, a significant number of MEPs failed to vote according to their wishes."
"I therefore make a formal request for the vote to be taken again."
"There is no risk involved, as the House will simply indicate what its true wishes are."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Please, we are dealing with a serious and important issue."
"I would ask you to cooperate with the Bureau so that we can make a rational and appropriate analysis of what is happening."
"There is no need to support each speech with approvals from one side or the other."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of one's opinion on this vote, I have one comment, and I would like the chairmen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to respond to this: what has been said here is a gross impertinence that the whole of Parliament should condemn."
"This President was elected by a large majority, and he has the right to lead every vote, whether you like it or not."
"Anything else is impertinent and obscene!"
"(Applause from the left)"
"(ES) Mr President, I simply wished to refer to your reply to the Vice-President of Parliament, Mr Vidal-Quadras, to the effect that it falls to the President of the European Parliament to interpret the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 159(1) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure states that Parliament will normally vote by show of hands, and Rule 159(2) says that 'if the President decides that the result is doubtful, a fresh vote shall be taken using the electronic voting system'."
"Mr President, you proceeded to an electronic vote before any result was known and that has led to confusion."
"Mr President, two months remain of your mandate in this Parliament."
"Do not compromise your independence or prestige, because neither you nor this Parliament deserve that."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"I shall give the floor to Mr Poettering for a final speech on points of order; there will be no more, because this could go on forever."
"I will then consult the Members of the Bureau so that I can take the appropriate decision in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, this morning, in the difficult situation in which we find ourselves, we had a debate that was very definitely worthy of this House."
"Now is the time for all of us to take action, and I would like to make it clear that the integrity of the President of this House is not being questioned."
"(Applause)"
"Having said that, I would also ask that we now find a process that will enable us to come to a decision."
"It would have been right if the first vote had been by show of hands, since that is the normal way of going about it."
"I then assumed you had called an immediate electronic vote on the grounds that you thought the results were so close together, but the normal way of voting would have been by show of hands."
"This voting process then had the regrettable result that some Members ended up voting a different way than they had intended."
"There is also the question as to whether the common text on which the groups agreed was put together properly and whether translations are available."
"Taken together, all this adds up to a whole bundle of problems, and so I would like to appeal to your goodwill in order that we may repeat the votes before moving on to vote on the groups' joint motion for a resolution."
"This House will then have spoken, and its political will will then have been made manifest."
"I ask you now to show the goodwill of which I have spoken."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Poettering."
"Thank you for coming out in defence of the honour of the President of the European Parliament."
"I believe that what Mrs Doyle has said is totally unacceptable and that it has nothing to do with what is happening here."
"(Applause)"
"We have more important things to discuss."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to take a few minutes to consult the members of the Bureau in relation to the three issues that have been raised during these speeches."
"The Presidency will then announce its decision and I would remind you that, according to Rule 166(4) of our Rules of Procedure, the President will take the decision he considers appropriate, immediately after the points of order that have been raised with regard to what is being discussed, and that the President's decision will not be subject to any vote."
"In other words, whatever the President decides will be applied."
"Please allow me now to consult the members of the Bureau on the technical issues relating to the three problems raised."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, having consulted Parliament's services and having studied the aspects of our Rules of Procedure that relate to the issues that we have debated, I believe that we should proceed as follows:"
"with regard to the Resolution presented by a series of political groups, the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups, I am told - and I have no reason to doubt it - that the text is available in all languages."
"I am also told that there were last-minute amendments to the text, yesterday, that the Bureau accepted them without subjecting them to any formal amendment procedure because it did not believe that to be necessary."
"The Resolution presented by the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups is therefore ready to be voted on in the version subject to the latest amendment for the purposes of incorporating it into the debate."
"We shall vote on it;"
"secondly, it is very reasonable to believe that there has been some confusion and that some Members have voted the second time without being aware of precisely what was being voted on, despite the fact that I believe the Presidency had made it very clear."
"I believe, however, that the objections have been raised with the best of intentions and that there have certainly been errors in the interpretation of what we were voting on."
"Consequently, and in order to truly reflect this Parliament's democratic will, I shall repeat the two votes."
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament rejected the amendment by show of hand, verified electronically)"
"The result of the second round is therefore the same as that of the first: the amendment has been rejected."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution by the PPE-DE and UEN Groups by roll-call vote)"
"The result is therefore exactly the same as the previous result, but I imagine that everybody will feel reassured and that the will of the Members will have been better reflected."
"(Parliament approved the motion for a resolution by the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups by roll-call vote)"

"European order for payment procedure (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"(IT) Mr President, I would like to refer to the Rules of Procedure and I thank you for having quickly granted my request to speak."
"The speed with which the Presidency has given me the floor gives me the assurance that my voice can reach even where the microphones do not."
"According to the Rules of Procedure I must propose that, following the decision made and the subsequent vote, we proceed immediately to amend our Rules of Procedure in line with the practice that has been established in the Chamber today."
"From now on it will no longer be obligatory to have access to texts in all languages twenty-four hours beforehand, but it will be sufficient to receive texts at the time of the vote, and it will no longer be necessary to table oral amendments, since any one of us may amend texts put to the vote, even at the last minute."
"Mr President, allow me to congratulate you, since this means that once again a blow has been struck to democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, I just wanted to say that today has been a difficult day and that I believe that the decision to repeat the vote represents a dangerous and wholly unnecessary precedent."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the committee and the political groups requested that we vote on compromise amendment 4 first, as it is the amendment that was agreed with the Council and the Commission in the trialogue."
"It respects our rules in Parliament on the new comitology procedure."
"That would mean, therefore, that amendment 2 will fall, when you take compromise amendment 4 first."
"In view of the statement given by Commissioner Frattini during the debate on Monday and his commitment to look at the effects of this regulation and the civil justice laws for parties domiciled in third countries, in particular the States of the European Economic Area, the groups have agreed not to insist on Amendment 1."
"Therefore we will be voting as groups against that amendment."
"I hope that avoids any confusion during the vote."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, the Presidency also takes note of Parliament's interest in extending the scope of the European order for payment procedure to claimants and defendants resident in a European Economic Area member country."
"However, also taking into account the negotiations in the Council, it appears to be impossible to change the definition of cross-border cases in the text of the regulation at this stage."
"The Presidency is available to look more closely into the effects of the regulation for parties domiciled in states of the European Economic Area."

"- Before the vote:"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, there is hardly any need to underline the importance of the legislative proposals for the second generation Schengen information system."
"The SIS II system is a central tool for law enforcement authorities and at the same time makes it possible to expand the Schengen area and abolish controls at internal borders."
"For the first time in the history of the European Union, we are creating a legislative basis for a massive information system in codecision with the European Parliament."
"The Presidency has, together with the European Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Coelho, prepared a compromise that it is hoped will be acceptable to all parties at first reading."
"We thank Mr Coelho and his team for their cooperation."
"The Council's position on the legislative package on SIS II was submitted to the President of Parliament in early October."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs voted on its position on 5 October."
"It did not approve the addition proposed by the Council concerning authorities' access to the system."
"According to the Council's position, all authorities that enter data in the SIS II system should also have access to that system."
"This would ensure full and indispensable cooperation between all authorities involved in the protection of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The addition concerning access by authorities was proposed at a very late stage in the negotiations."
"Therefore, it is fully understandable that the Committee on Civil Liberties felt that it could not approve the addition without an opportunity to examine the issue in more detail."
"The Presidency followed the plenary discussion on this issue on Monday with great interest."
"I hope that the European Parliament can approve the proposed text today."
"In the next few weeks the Council will discuss the outcome of the plenary vote by Parliament."
"I believe that we can reach a solution with Parliament at first reading."
"I want to emphasise that we are now very close to a solution for this important legislative matter."

"Access to SIS II by the services responsible for issuing vehicle registration certificates (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, the Council could not attend the Monday debate and has just issued a statement."
"I feel it is right that Parliament should issue its response to the Council's statement through your rapporteur."
"If I may, Mr President, I should just like to make two very simple remarks."
"Firstly, I wish to congratulate the Presidency on its work on this matter, and, like the Presidency, I believe that Parliament can be pleased with the fact that the Act that we are about to adopt will help strengthen our external borders, and will help increase our citizens' security."
"The Presidency contributed a great deal to this process, but the Council, as such, did not."
"The Council did not honour its undertakings in the trialogue in May here in Strasbourg."
"I hope that the Council does not do to the Finnish Presidency what it did to the Austrian Presidency. Hopefully, it will honour its commitments and adopt the document in the form in which we are set to adopt it, because this is the only way in which we will have an agreement at first reading and in which the second generation Schengen Information System will enter into force without delay."

"I would simply like to thank all my colleagues at the Committee on International Trade, beginning with its chairman, and all the staff of the Secretariat, for the excellent work carried out and for the contribution made to the debate on what is a very sensitive and difficult subject regarding Europe's future not only in terms of trade, but also from the point of view of our freedom."
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Mr President, unfortunately the vote on the peace process in the Basque Country has been slightly poisoned by the procedural measures, but I believe it is a good day for the process because the European Parliament has supported it and has been involved in it."
"That is fundamental in solving the political conflict that is now taking place in the Basque Country and the Spanish State."
"Steps will now have to be taken to solve the problems in the Basque Country."
"On the one hand, there is a need to cease all armed activity and dismantle the terrorist organisation ETA, but, on the other hand, the political conflict has to be faced and resolved."
"If there is no pressure to resolve the political issue, there could be a terrible situation in future."
"The involvement of the European Parliament is very important, because we now have a concrete arena in which to resolve the conflict and that might be the only possible way."
"Europe is the place in which this political issue has to be resolved."
"We have found the right arena."
"The Basque community, along with political parties, trade unions and the European Union, also needs to be involved in the solution."
"(ES) Mr President, as a Basque political representative, I do not believe that I am mistaken in saying that, for the great majority of Basque citizens, of Euskadi or of Euskal Herria, today is a great day, an historic day, on which this Parliament, the institution representing all of the Europeans, is finally agreeing to turn its attention to a part of its internal territory which has been suffering a conflict for a very long time, a conflict which, because it has not been dealt with properly or quickly enough, has led a group of extremists to resort to violence over recent years, spreading death and pain."
"Today, Basque society has rejected the use of violence to achieve political objectives and fortunately it would appear to have genuinely opted for a democratic solution to the conflict."
"I would call upon those people who have not wanted to make it possible for the citizens to speak rather than bombs, to reflect and to look to the future, and, once this Parliament has voted by a majority, to democratically accept the Resolution approved and allow the process to move ahead."
"Finally, on behalf of the majority of the Basque people, I would like to thank all of the Members of the European Parliament, who, by voting by a majority in favour of this motion for a resolution, will have given us the opportunity to achieve peace."
"I trust that we will not let you down."
"(FR) Mr President, I am speaking in this House as a Member representing the Basque country, since my constituency covers Ipar Euskadi, that is to say the northern part of the Basque country."
"This is a very important day for the European Parliament, since we have decided, as good Europeans, to apply the European method, which makes dialogue the only solution to violence."
"The ingredients of the process applied to the Basque country are as follows: firstly, the cessation of violence; secondly, the opening of a debate from which no one is debarred, given that we make peace with our enemies, not with our friends; thirdly, the proper conducting of a fair debate whose outcome is not pre-determined; and, finally, a result that, whatever form it takes, will have to be validated democratically."
"I would urge France also to commit itself to the process."
"Indeed, we need to stop being hypocritical, given that the Basque country straddles the Pyrenees."
"I shall conclude with a splendid phrase that I found on a wall in the Basque country and that, I believe, is attributable to Gandhi: 'There is no path to peace."
"Peace is the path'."
"(ES) Like previous speakers, I would like to congratulate the European Parliament on having created a new milestone on the road to peace in the Basque Country."
"It has not been a simple task; we have witnessed that and we have suffered it, but things are never simple when it comes to peace processes."
"Over recent days we have seen certain gestures and certain attitudes that do nothing to help resolve the Basque conflict, but this must not be a reason for us to cease in our efforts to find a reasonable solution, which leads a complex situation towards a framework of political dialogue in which there is no room for violence of any kind."
"That is essentially what we have voted for and approved today: condemnation of violence, solidarity with all of the victims and support for peace."
"It is sad to see that not everybody is willing to take on that task, but there are enough of us to suggest that we are truly at the beginning of the end."
"I hope that those people who have not supported us in this Resolution will eventually realise that this is the right direction to take."
"(HU) I would like to comment that the Spanish Government's efforts to begin a dialogue with the ETA terrorist organisation is nothing new."
"In my capacity as a former Hungarian ambassador, I came to learn that every democratic government conducted negotiations with representatives of the organisation."
"This was done by the Suárez government, by several governments led by Felipe González and also by the government of José María Aznar."
"Why did I speak and do I speak now on behalf of the 13 Hungarian members of the European People's Party?"
"Because for us, the question of enforcing minority rights is extremely important."
"Many Hungarians, our compatriots, live as minorities outside the borders of Hungary."
"We have to affirm one thing: minority rights must be protected within the framework of the rule of law and European norms."
"Let me emphasise that no matter how anyone voted, we will continue to stand up for human and minority rights, and that we condemn the use of force and terror in any shape or form."
"(NL) Mr President, as non-attached MEPs, we have not had the opportunity to express our criticism or add anything to the texts, and that is why we have been unable to vote in favour of either of the present resolutions."
"In the one case, we could not be in favour, because we cannot possibly agree to a resolution according to which the Basque country cannot, in principle, be independent."
"In the other case, we could not vote in favour either, because we take the view that in a normal political world, talks can only be held with people who completely denounce violence - which is often no more than criminality - or even condemn it."
"What this comes down to, though, is that the European Union as such, or its institutions for that matter, should not really interfere in the domestic affairs of Spain or the Basque country, so as not to make the Basque country's separation from Spain, or remaining part of it, any more complicated than the electorate, democratically, want it to be."
"We should let Spain and the Basque country decide for themselves through peaceful negotiations and in a democratic manner."
"(ES) Mr President, I too am a Basque political representative."
"Basque and Spanish."
"I would like to state in this House that Basque society has always been against terrorism, not just now."
"I would like to state in this House that the terrorist group ETA is not an extremist organisation, it is a terrorist organisation, which for forty years has been murdering in violation of Spanish democracy. I would like to state in this House that there is no political conflict in Spain that is any different from that of any other democratic country in the European Union."
"These are the political conflicts inherent in democracy. What exists in Spain, in Euskadi, is a terrorist organisation, called ETA, which has been murdering in violation of democracy for forty years."
"Mr President, I have not voted for any of the Resolutions in a political gesture opposed to a debate entitled 'on the peace process in Spain', because I am fifty-four, Mr President, I have never lived through war, I have lived the whole of my life in Euskadi and in Euskadi we do not lack peace, we lack freedom."
"The challenge is therefore freedom, and to talk about a peace process may encourage certain people to have the nerve to claim that terrorism is a product of a political conflict, and there is no such political conflict in our country."
"I voted in favour of the resolution tabled by my colleague Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the peace process in Spain in relation to the problems facing the Basque country."
"I wish to commend the fact that Parliament has spoken with one voice in condemning the use of violence, in paying tribute to the victims of terrorism, and in calling for a complete return to peace."
"I am very disappointed that the political groups have failed to agree on a common text on a matter as serious as this, whilst not overlooking the fact that the responsibility for dealing with this issue rests primarily with the Member States concerned, namely Spain and France and the political forces in those countries."
"I hope that common sense will prevail and I am happy that my voice has joined the chorus of those who are convinced that this situation must be solved peacefully, by democratic means."
"We regret the fact that it was impossible to arrive at a common resolution on account of domestic party-political differences being too great in the area in question."
"Despite this, everyone is agreed that dialogue is the only answer to reach a peaceful solution."
"If this is to happen, all democratic forces will need to combine together in order to facilitate a political solution between all peoples in Spain."
"It is therefore unacceptable that every democratic process, which entails a change to the EU's internal borders, based on the right to self-determination, should be condemned from the word go."
"This would also immediately condemn all democratic and peaceful processes leading to more autonomy and independence in other European Member States."
"Take Belgium, where the call for Flemish independence is getting louder."
"I believe that regionalisation and Europeanisation can go hand in hand."
"My party, the N-VA - New Flemish Alliance - stands for a peaceful Europe where all peoples are given the chance to develop, based on the right to self-determination and in a spirit of 'unity in diversity'."
"That is why this debate on a possible peaceful solution cannot be reduced to a debate on terrorism alone."
"in writing. Since the announcement of the ETA ceasefire in March of this year, Sinn Féin has argued that a unique opportunity exists for resolving the conflict in the Basque Country."
"All political forces that believe this to be an important political objective, including the European Union, should do all in their power to ensure that this opportunity is grasped."
"It is unfortunate that both resolutions presented to Parliament today do not address the central issues nor where the peace process is today."
"The EPP-ED resolution was opposed to the peace process."
"The joint resolution, while better than that of the EPP-ED, was clearly a missed opportunity."
"On that basis we voted against the EPP-ED resolution and abstained on the joint resolution."
"There is an urgent need for all-party talks, a need to respect all political mandates, including that of Batasuna, and a need to end the ongoing political show trials against Basque left nationalist political activists."
"Sinn Féin remains committed to supporting the Basque peace process, will continue to meet all political parties in the region and will offer whatever assistance those parties deem appropriate."
"in writing. - (FR) Without prejudging the basis and the validity of the approach taken by Mr Zapatero's government, it is not for the European institutions to adopt a position on a matter that, by its very nature - relating as it does to the status and the future of a province - falls within the internal policy of a Member State."
"That is particularly the case when there is such intense internal debate between a parliamentary majority and opposition."
"Because it asks the Council and the Commission to take appropriate measures, the joint resolution is obviously at risk of being abused."
"The rationale of a number of the political groups that have signed the resolution and whose ambition it is to internationalise the conflict is dangerous and counter-productive."
"The Spanish should be left to manage and settle this conflict between themselves."
"In these conditions, an alternative resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was fully justified."
"I should, however, have liked the reasoning to have revolved around rejection on principle of the examination of a matter internal to a Member State."
"That is why I abstained from voting on both resolutions."
"Because the European Parliament has now been genuinely taken hostage by the Spanish Socialists, who initiated this debate, we initially considered abstaining from voting on the two resolutions proposed today."
"If we have, in the end, supported the resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is because it states what is our own conviction, namely that ETA has not fulfilled the conditions for becoming a credible negotiating partner."
"It hardly needs pointing out that ETA has offered no apology to the families of the 1 000 victims of the attacks and that it has never renounced armed conflict."
"On 23 September, it was again committing itself to pursuing the armed struggle, written in blood."
"We have voted against the resolution by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and by other groups, not because of its content - bland and unhelpful as it is --but because it is, to all intents and purposes, dictated by Batasuna."
"ETA has always tried to internationalise the peace process."
"Through the efforts of its political wing and thanks to the Spanish Socialists, this aim has now been achieved in a European Parliament deeply divided by a debate that ought never to have taken place here and now."
"As long as ETA has not renounced armed conflict, it will remain a terrorist organisation to be fought and not a political force with which to engage in dialogue."
"It is not right that problems of this kind - which have to do with a Member State's internal affairs - be put on the agenda of this House."
"With the exception of our Spanish Members, we are not given the opportunity to have a full debate on the subject, which - although certainly important - is thereby degraded to nothing more than a party-political dispute, for it would be absurd for the Members from other countries not to have entire confidence in their group's Spanish Members where this issue is concerned."
"In principle, though, I take the view that no region or minority ought, in striving for autonomy, to have recourse to violence, for that way of doing things runs counter to the European values that we have been defending for over sixty years, and this I say in full awareness of my being here as a representative of the German-speaking community in Belgium."
"The Basques are in an exceptional position compared to most other European peoples."
"At the start of the nineteenth century, Europe was carved up between a handful of large, multi-ethnic states."
"The Vienna Congress in 1815 believed it could secure this division of states and relevant borders for ever."
"From 1830, two-thirds of today's European states came about either by violent or by peaceful means, as a result of the democratic fight for government and education in the people's own language."
"Of the remaining multilingual states, Spain and Belgium have adopted a federal form whose administration recognises the difference in language and culture."
"Unfortunately, within Spain, the Basque country is still split between the three major Basque provinces that form one region together, along with the region of Navarre, of which only the western half has a Basque majority."
"The demands of the Basques are comparable to those of Catalonia, which have now largely been met."
"The response to their demands should not be military or judicial oppression of the kind meted out by former Spanish governments and advocated by the present Right-wing opposition."
"We rejoice to see that the independence movement and the Spanish state are finally seeking a peaceful solution together and that most groups in this House are backing this process."
"in writing. UKIP have abstained on Resolution on the principle that this is clearly a nation state matter and thus wholly inappropriate for the EU to interfere in or pass judgement upon."
"The territorial integrity of a Member State and their approach to tackling terrorism should be left to the discretion of the state, appropriately representing and accountable to their citizens who are directly affected."
"UKIP abhors and opposes terrorism in all forms."
"in writing. I oppose this EPP resolution criticising Spanish government efforts to negotiate peace."
"If the criteria the EPP seeks to apply were applied initially to the Irish process, the IRA would still be engaged in its murder campaign."
"As we know, doubts about the commitment of the IRA continued to exist, 10 years on."
"But structures have evolved to pressure them and monitor their activities; to ensure that they were disarming and completely committed to politics."
"It can be said that, had the process not been in place, up to 1000 further deaths could have occurred in that period in Northern Ireland."
"The Spanish government is dealing with one of the most difficult tasks - how to bring internal, politically driven violence to an end."
"The view we are asked to endorse is that of the party in opposition in Spain."
"This view is contrary to the considered position of the current democratically elected government of the Spanish people."
"In the UK and Ireland there is cross-party support for the Irish peace process, even though from time to time parties have been critical of details."
"This is one of the reasons it has been successful to date."
"in writing. The vote on this resolution has put the PPE-DE Irish delegation in a difficult position."
"The Irish Peace Process has been a success and we recognise the support of the EU for that process."
"After more than 40 years of terrorism, violence and conflict all parties are now working towards a lasting peace in Ireland."
"We would like to see a successful peace process in Spain also and an end to the use of violence for political ends."
"However, there are dangers in drawing parallels between the Irish Peace Process and the situation that currently exists in Spain."
"To begin with, the Irish Peace process has the support of two sovereign governments and the support of the vast majority of political parties on both islands."
"In Spain there is still deep political division on how best to proceed."
"It is unfortunate that the European Parliament is being forced to divide on such a fundamentally important issue for Spain."
"However, with Spanish Members so deeply divided on the resolution before us, it has made it impossible for the rest of Parliament to form a united view on a subject that we really should not be divided on."
"Fundamentally, we all want to support an end to political violence in Spain."
"(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. I welcome this resolution on the peace process in Spain and very much regret that the right in the Parliament was not part of the coalition supporting the peace process."
"It is sad that they have turned their backs on the very wise words of their own former Prime Minister José María Aznar, who in 1998 said ""For peace, and its right, we must open our hearts to hope and forgiveness."
"In our fight for peace, we will do our best with the help and hope of everybody."""
"What a pity the EPP could not capture that spirit in today's debate."
"(DE) Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the German Free Democratic Party did not participate in the vote on the motion for a resolution."
"The motion for a resolution bears the legend 'European Parliament resolution on the peace process in Spain'."
"This we regard as a matter to be resolved at the national level, and believe that the European Union should not concern itself with matters over which it has no power and for which it has no responsibility."
"We are particularly critical, in this context, of paragraph 3 of the resolution, in which the Council and the Commission are urged to take appropriate action, something that we regard as going against the subsidiarity principle."
"It is for this reason that we have refrained from participation in the vote."
"(NL) Mr President, I have voted against the Socialist-inspired joint motion for a resolution on the so-called peace process in Spain."
"I was so naïve as to believe that the European treaties had introduced the principle of subsidiarity, but no, Europe wants to interfere in purely domestic Spanish affairs."
"I was so naïve as to believe that democrats would not get round the table with murderers and terrorists and bow to their blackmail, but no, it appears that this is the sort of practice Europe wants to encourage from now on."
"This does, however, create a dangerous precedent."
"It appears that the Left-wingers in this House, followed by quite a few 'useful idiots' in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, consider it normal that the government of one of the Member States should negotiate with a terrorist organisation which is not even prepared to offer its apologies to the families of all the people it has senselessly killed over the years."
"If, however, you realise that some of the group chairmen in this House who are tabling this resolution today have in the past personally given shelter to wanted terrorists, including Hans-Joachim Klein of the Rote Armee Fraktion, you should not be surprised by anything emanating from the Left and extreme Left, who are always prepared to take the moral high ground on every other issue."
"'Chassez le naturel, il revient au galop'."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to make a personal statement and ask the Member who has just spoken to apologise."
"Members who do not vote as you do are not to be referred to as idiots."
"(Replying to Mr Martinez, who heckles him)"
"Whether what was said was 'useful' or 'useless' idiot is scarcely relevant."
"I know."
"I have read as much Lenin as you, Mr Martinez"
"That being said, I would ask you, Mr President, to ask the Member of whom I was speaking to apologise."
"I shall then offer my explanation of vote."
"(Applause)"
"(Replying to Mr Martinez, who heckles him again)"
"I am familiar with Lenin."
"Just because Lenin uses insults, that does not mean that you must do the same ..."
"Just a moment please, Mr Dillen."
"I imagine that you did not wish to call your honourable friends idiots."
"I would therefore ask you to correct or clarify exactly what you said."
"(NL) Mr President, I did not use the word 'idiots', but actually said 'useful idiots', which has been a frequently-used term in politics for over a century and which, as Mr Martinez reminded us a moment ago, was coined by Lenin."
"It is a typically political expression which is often used in political debate and which was certainly not meant personally."
"If this is what the speaker thought, then I should like to apologise."
"It was simply a political attack and certainly not a personal one."
"(FR) Mr President, I do accept his apology, but I do not believe that the addition of an adjective reduces the import of the noun it qualifies."
"A 'great' imbecile is still an imbecile, is he not?"
"I turn now to my explanation of vote."
"Like my colleagues in the Union for French Democracy (UDF), I voted in favour of the resolution in support of the peace initiative in the Basque country, adopted by the Spanish Parliament."
"Through this vote, we wanted to declare our solidarity with the democratic authorities in Spain at a time when a delicate process is being entered into to eliminate violence and re-establish civil order in the Basque country."
"However, we only voted in favour of this resolution because the new wording of paragraph 6 - which Mr Vidal-Quadras rightly called a substantial modification of the initial text - points out very clearly that this issue falls exclusively within the competence of Spain."
"It would not have been right for the European Parliament to have set itself up as a supervisory authority for the Spanish Parliament in a matter that has to do with national sovereignty."
"Parliament and the European Council are, however, playing their full role by giving the Spanish authorities the moral and political support that they are entitled to expect."
"In this connection, it is, to Parliament's ear, illogical, to say the least, for Spain's People's Party to denounce international interference in their country's internal affairs while proposing a resolution outrightly and unequivocally condemning the vote in the Cortes."
"In supporting the decisions taken by Spain's legal authorities, Parliament is certainly showing more respect for Spanish sovereignty than it would have done in condemning those decisions, as it was asked to do by the Spanish opposition."
"Rather than try to intimidate French MEPs in the centre of the political spectrum, as he did in this morning's Le Figaro, Mr Rajoy would have done better to have questioned the coherence of his own approach and of the approach of his party in Strasbourg."
"in writing. The Spanish peace process is a brave and necessary initiative."
"While the government in Spain is seeking to end ETA bloodshed through dialogue and negotiation, it is incumbent on all democratic parties, both inside and outside Spain, to offer support to the process."
"That does not prevent us from maintaining a critical perspective, with regard to the seriousness of the ETA organisation's commitment to making the necessary compromises."
"Incidents such as the kidnapping in Southwest France by the ETA organisation are a test of the process."
"There may be other such incidents before the process is concluded."
"In these circumstances, it is a matter for the government of Spain to judge whether such incidents indicate a deliberate breach of the ETA ceasefire and to act accordingly."
"It is necessary to bear in mind the sensitivities of the victims of terror and their families during the process and in its conclusion."
"But the process is primarily about preventing further killing and destruction."
"Those victims of terror who support the current peace process are to be congratulated for their generosity and courage."
"They, despite their pain, have opted to try and prevent others facing the same trauma in the future."
"in writing. (SV) Terrorism, in all its forms, is a detestable phenomenon that, more often than not, hits innocent civilians."
"A true democrat must, in all situations, reject and condemn acts of that kind."
"Parliament has today debated motions for resolutions by the majority of political groups concerning the peace process in Spain."
"The rejection of terrorism and the stand taken in favour of the peace process have, unfortunately, been permeated by a political power struggle that really belongs to Spanish politics."
"The issue concerned is one that, in the end, must be resolved in the sovereign state of the Kingdom of Spain."
"It is thus very depressing to see the opportunism with which different political forces in the European Parliament are trying to exploit this tragic chapter in Spanish history."
"In accordance with the above reasoning, I have today abstained from voting on all the motions for resolutions concerning the peace process in Spain."
"in writing. (ES) We are giving our opinion today on a motion for a resolution supporting the peace process in Spain."
"The content of this resolution represents unreserved support for the peace process and the fight against terrorist violence in our country in the terms established by the Congress of Deputies in May 2005."
"In that statement, the Congress expressed its support for the Zapatero government's plans to begin talks processes with those people who wish to abandon violence, while at all times respecting the law and democratic principles."
"I voted against the adopted resolution for a number of reasons."
"First of all, it is unacceptable, in my view, that (these or any other) initiatives aimed at putting an end to ETA's terrorist activities are referred to as a 'peace process'."
"The choice of words is biased and disingenuous."
"There is no war."
"Rather, what we have is, on the one hand, a free, democratic country that respects autonomies and, on the other, a people that has suffered from the indiscriminate, unjustifiable violence of a terrorist group."
"Secondly, I cannot vote for a resolution that fails to acknowledge clearly that it is impossible to negotiate with a terrorist group that refuses, prior to those negotiations, explicitly to renounce violence."
"Lastly, I feel that it is for Spain and the Spanish people to resolve the issue of Basque terrorism as they see fit, but I refuse to support a resolution in Parliament on this issue that makes no reference to ETA's unjustified and indefensible motives."
"In addition to the methods to which they resort, namely terrorism, this organisation is worthy of our complete, unreserved condemnation. In this case, we must condemn the substance of the terrorists' claims, and should give them no succour in terms of a democratic vote."
"The terms in which the motion for a resolution was tabled for discussion are offensive to most Spanish people and in particular to the victims of terrorism in Spain."
"This has been made abundantly clear by the association that represents the overwhelming majority of the victims, which has referred to the process initiated by the Spanish Government as capitulation."
"The very title of the resolution inaccurately suggests the existence of two legitimate sides engaged in a peace process, when what is actually at stake is talks between a government and a terrorist group responsible for murder, persecution and extortion, of which hundreds of Spanish citizens have been the victims."
"It must not be forgotten that, following the cease-fire declared by ETA, its Members have issued threats, no weapons have been handed in and news has come to light of attempts at re-arming."
"To open unconditional dialogue with terrorists who not only fail to condemn but actually justify the armed struggle and who show no remorse for the innocents they slaughter is tantamount to an incredible surrender on the part of the political authorities of a democratic country."
"That is no cause for celebration."
"I am appalled by the opportunism shown by the Zapatero government, which has sought to obtain internationally what it has failed to obtain from its citizens."
"in writing. While I voted with the EPP and rapporteur on this, I would just like to draw attention to the case of the European City Guides, in which individuals, small companies and even schools have been sucked into a scheme where they have had money fraudulently extracted from them with no clear means of redress."
"While I believe this report to be generally of benefit to European businesses, it must also be noted that it could leave the way open for an intensification of the kind of practices carried out by European City Guides."
"in writing. (SV) The content of the programme can be brought into question."
"In her justification at first reading, the rapporteur wrote that it 'will make an important contribution to the active citizenship of young people in society and thus enhance their feeling of being part of Europe, so that it is likely to deliver substantial European added value'."
"We question whether the programme really will make a substantial contribution to this objective."
"International youth exchanges are a good thing, but they need to be funded through the efforts of civil society or by the Member States."
"We do not believe that the EU should involve itself in this type of activity."
"I supported the Gröner report, on which Parliament voted today, on the 'Youth in Action' programme for 2007-2013."
"I particularly welcome the proposal to guarantee funding for youth-related activities throughout Europe."
"This new programme provides for action under five headings: Youth for Europe, European Voluntary Service, Youth of the World, Youth Workers and support systems, and Support for policy cooperation."
